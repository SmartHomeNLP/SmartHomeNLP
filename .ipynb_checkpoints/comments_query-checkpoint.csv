magicfab,"I am in the same boat. I've decided to focus on Free open source software solutions and standards-based devices, with an emphasis on privacy. Our first few weeks have been exploring the hardware available, then focusing on Zigbee / Zwave devices and the big brands (Hue, Lutron, etc.). I am also exploring voice control, trying to avoid Alexa, Google and Apple while doing everything on LAN ie. without depending on Cloud and in general, the Internet - except for initial configuration and updates.

After a few weeks experimenting with different solutions, our focus is on OpenHAB while keeping an eye on [Mozilla's WebThings Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway/) project which has a lot of activity and improves by the day.

IMO having a demo ready is important. OpenHAB does a great job on that.

I've found the least path of resistance is approaching existing alarm companies (they know cabling, have customers, are always looking to compete with others), and residential/commercial construction and renovation businesses. You may also want to decide who will be your customers, perhaps not deal with home/business property owners directly.

I' ve been asked to make a hardware prototype of such a free open source-based solution so that's what we're doing. So far that means an rPi + Zwave/zigbee USB stick, high endurance CD and some devices to show. We' re considering another higher-end device (mini PC + SSD), and testing both approaches. Having a cheap rPI + SD card seems to be more efefctive even keeping in minf SD replacements every once in a while.

tomgabriele,"&gt; BL helps to have internal usage and secures the data to preserve privacy.

What do you mean by ""internal usage""? Z-wave can be encrypted too, though if these are just sensors, the threat of someone knowing the internal temperature of your house seems minimal compared to, say, being able to unlock your front door. 

&gt; BLE uses less energy as z-wave does

It does? I thought they were comparable. A single CR2032 will power a z-wave door/temp sensor for years; is your device so power hungry that it won't last even with a mini PV panel?

&gt; which is great for our target users. 

Who are your target users, and what are they doing with these?

&gt; This hub will be designed by us as well but won't be a jewel of technology such as the witness. It's basically an antenna that relays witness device to your phone. 

That sounds like any other HA hub, why recreate the wheel and require yet another hub, instead of complying to existing HA standards?

&gt; However the advantage of BLE is that it is a local network and can work autonomously even in the absence of wi-fi.

Wait, I thought you just said that the hub relays over wifi. If you didn't know, z-wave doesn't require wifi either...all my devices and sensors still work without a wifi network.",1573738270,f7hdbbt,t3_dw6zrw,t1_f7h61p8,/r/homeautomation/comments/dw6zrw/developing_a_witness_sensor_would_love_to_hear_if/f7hdbbt/,1,homeautomation

I'm also on the development team and will answer to some of your questions. BL helps to have internal usage and secures the data to preserve privacy. Of course we could encrypt the data too.
BLE uses less energy as z-wave does and as you see in the picture the PV cell is small so we really needed to save as much energy as possible.
Our range is not that small though and we can reach 10-15 m which is great for our target users. Then we'd like to connect each of the witness devices to a fixed station, the hub your were suggesting, (regular electricity source) that can communicate via wi-fi for range increase directly to your phone. This hub will be designed by us as well but won't be a jewel of technology such as the witness. It's basically an antenna that relays witness device to your phone.
However the advantage of BLE is that it is a local network and can work autonomously even in the absence of wi-fi. That means no long range communication without wi-fi but I guess this pain is bearable ...

I have Lutron caseta light switches because they came on special with a Wink hub a few years back when there was less cheaper offerings.

The Wink hub has gone down in reliability so I replaced it with a Lutron hub and home assistant on a Linux NUC I had already running connected to my TV. Too expensive for just lights but reliable and work even when internet is down. Wish the switch would look better though.

The Wemo dimmers look good but they are WIFI and would not be reliable in an automation for me. They might be good for you as they have good reviews and are popular enough that if you want to invest in automation, they are often well supported.

If you go for zwave switches and are going to use an Alexa or google home device as previously suggested then they can be the hub if you are not too paranoid about privacy :-)",1573174671,f6v2871,t3_dt2utt,t1_f6uap7s,/r/homeautomation/comments/dt2utt/new_to_this_trying_to_figure_out_options_for/f6v2871/,1,homeautomation

amluchon,"Hey! Thank you for taking the time out for this!

I agree with everything you said - the ease of use, established community, broad support and Samsung's backing are some of the strongest factors on ST's side. The added integration with Samsung's mobile products is also intriguing (been eyeing the Galaxy Watch for a pretty long time now). The limited local support is the main constraining factor in my opinion - followed by the privacy issue. However, the strengths are so overwhelming that I'm actually considering skipping on some smart devices and just getting both ST and Hubitat.

Re Hubitat, the local processing is a good fall back option and the speed with which commands are executed is also compelling. My IFTTT integrations haven't exactly been the fastest in getting executed (being in India doesn't exactly help latency I'm assuming) so I'm skeptical about only cloud based control. Plus there's the added privacy benefit (though that's kind of nullified if I get both and continue using Alexa for voice control).

However, if I buy both I'll have to look for devices which work with both ST and Hubitat - though IIRC there're a fair number of manufacturers which work with both. The sad thing is that neither of them seems to support Tuya and that's a bummer since Tuya devices are the most easily available ones here in India.",1572899758,f6jszd4,t3_drktnz,t1_f6j8z5i,/r/homeautomation/comments/drktnz/first_hub_hubitat_andor_smartthings/f6jszd4/,1,homeautomation

I use openhab for my hub.

Another option is home assistant

Prebuilt hubs like smarthings and homeseer are also a good option but openhab and home assistant are open source and respect your privacy along with still working fine even if you have no internet.

The switches are where the smart happens and even if no hub is available they act as regular switches. You can put the regular switches back in or just leave them when you move. Some plug in lights are color tuneable but for the most part there is no need for that - just choose the color appropriately for the room and how it will be used. Use lamps with smart bulbs to achieve ""scenes"" where you need color adjustment. (One color in the main lights and another or adjustable in the lamps - use the lamps to adjust color in the room.) You can take the lamps with you when you move obviously.

This solution will be the cheapest over time due to the fact that high quality ""dumb"" bulbs can be used instead of smart bulbs in most cases.

kigmatzomat,"I went with Homeseer because of longevity. They have been doing HA for 20ish years and sell both controllers and client devices, so they have a wide range of engineering experience to draw on. Having experienced how companies that don't charge for software tend to either make money selling customer data or just go under,  I find it's better to pay with money over privacy or the hassle of forced migration.

And to be honest, if HS went under, their hardware can be repurposed because you get root access to the underlying linux or windows OS. I could run Hass or NodeRed on the system. Or camera NVR software or whatever. 

There isn't any other prebuilt system on the market you can say that about.  Well, sort of vera, but their system doesn't have any extra capacity to spare. 

Which was another point in its favor. The Zee2 is vastly more powerful than any other commercial controller you can buy. Homeseer zee2 is 4x1.2Ghz with 1GB ram. Smartthings range from 0.5-1Ghz single core cpus with 256-512MB ram. Veras have 1x0.6Ghz - 2x0.9Ghz with 128-256MB ram. Any way you slice it, the Zee2 has way more headroom.

Isy is kind of in it's own little world. ISY uses a custom real-time OS on the ~250Mhz cpu in a 994. They have added a additional devices to expand the functionality of their system that run in concert with the 994. Either way, if isy goes under their hardware can't be readily repurposed.

While I dont think ST is going under, I won't put it past samsung to stop supporting a given device over time. And to say their upgrades have not gone well is being kind.

Some people still run Homeseer HS2, while HS4 will be coming out over the winter. They didn't want to mess with it and let their hs2 systems run for the last 5ish years.

CubanoConReddit,"OP, almost all of the advice here is good. I’ve faced many of the same questions and did significant research into everything, as well as have friends who’ve gone through whole home automation. Seems to me you have a handful of major decision points:

1. Which wireless protocol to standardize on (zigged, zwave, wifi, etc.). Each has its pros and cons and sometimes it’s worth deviating from your chosen standard for a particular device that’s worth it. I myself have chosen Zwave Plus, which has some drawbacks when it’s comes to voice assistant compatibility, but the trade off is worth it for me. Only you can decide if that is true for whatever choices you make. 

2. Do you want your automation logic to stay completely local, allow cloud based services, or have a hybrid of the two. You may, for example, choose to have everything local except for cameras because how much you value that feature outweighs the privacy concerns. My friend choose to stay completely local but has zero voice assistance. I myself am looking at using HomeSeer/Raspberry Pi to stay local with some integrations with google voice (and eventually Siri). There can be other considerations like children being unable to reach switches but able to use voice, etc.

3. Which voice assistant to use, if any. Some home automation enthusiasts believe in true automation, meaning you should never have to invoke a voice assistant or manually intervene unless something breaks. Some enjoy the flexibility and lower effort cost of entry a voice assistant brings at the cost of privacy. Personally, I’m trying to use Siri to minimize the privacy cost but Zwave doesn’t have a lot of compatibility with it yet. That’s something I’m willing to live with until it’s fixed (if ever). In the meantime I use a Google Hub/Home for those purposes.

What you say is pretty spot on. Your delivery is probably what would garner you downvotes. Very aggressive for no real reason. 

Also, going local is not ALL about privacy. One point you didn’t make is using cloud services makes your home automation dependent on a cloud connection - their servers go down or your internet goes down, YOUR system goes down. There have been several cases of companies just deciding to stop support or folding, leaving their customers holding useless devices (or at very least, devices that no longer function as sold).

Best advice: Avoid cloud wherever you are able (I know there are time, cost, and skill restrictions) for both privacy and system stability reasons.",1570715056,f36nvo7,t3_dfsffr,t1_f365bwp,/r/homeautomation/comments/dfsffr/bought_a_house_want_to_make_it_smart_convenient/f36nvo7/,1,homeautomation
5-4-3-2-1-bang,"&gt; So, is there any hub that protects privacy more than the other? 

Yes, but you're not going to like the answer. Alexa, Google, Siri, they *all* ship your voice off to timfucktu for analysis.  Lock, stock, and barrel it's going to who knows where to be listened to by who knows whom. If you value your privacy, you don't use remote voice control, period. Don't pass go. Don't collect $200.  

Similarly, if you value your privacy you don't use cloud-connected services. Your garage door opener for one, your robotic vacuum for two. SmartThings for three.

It's possible to do everything with non-cloud connected devices. But it's *harder* (you have to do more work) and to some extent more expensive so most people say fuck it and trade their privacy for their convenience. You're an adult, that's a choice you're afforded to make. But don't be naive or disingenuous; you're absolutely trading privacy for convenience, and have to live with that choice.

TiberKing,"Siri for privacy. Not perfect but better than the others. 
High quality hardware (IOT)but limited selection. 
Native app for physical control (Home app)
Apple is my way or the highway.More upfront about what it does, usually. 


Alexa for simplicity and compatibility. 
Almost everything works with Alexa. 
Variety of options in almost everything for hardware. 
Works reliably when set up. But not the best app or ability to manage routines and setups. 
Not so great for privacy.  Has recently made some better privacy choices.  Amazon is still shady. 


Google. Best for knowledge. 
Very wordy with responses. Annoying after a while. 
Great accuracy and adaptability to the way you talk to it. 
Limited but usually good hardware. 
Not as open as Alexa. 
Not so great for privacy. Claims to change tune.  Google can be a little evil, sometimes. 

All three can do the job well.

I already recognize that my phone is used as the most effectively designed key logger ever. I value my privacy but don't want to forgo every modern convenience, so i try to compartmentalize as much of my digital life as possible. I also understand the massive security risk of running black box devices on my own networks.

For these reasons i will never own a Google home, an Alexa, or any other smart device (let's put aside my tv and phone) that by design spies on me or records every sound. I will never own a Nest device or any other ""smart"" home appliance that i haven't built myself.

I will never own a device that can be remotely disabled by a third party by design, for that reason I'll never buy a Tesla.

For the same reasons i won't send my DNA to ancestry.com i won't send more PII then necessary to any other company.

When something is actually useful, I don't hesitate to use it though.   

All my passwords are in Chrome sync, my printer is networked, I have UPnP enabled on the router(Yes, I checked that it's not one of the broken implementations).  Chrome's Data Saver is always on, I don't have ""do not track"" set up, and I use Gmail. 

My Orca card is in my wallet so I can just tap it, no RFID blocking sleeve or anything like that.

I do use two-factor authentication for my Google account, like any sane person would, because hackers and scammers are real,  but I'm not going to go out of my way to hide my search history.


The right to privacy is important, but everyone should decide for themselves if privacy is important. 

Looking into zero-cost ways of being private by default(Like the frictionless experience of browsing an HTTPS site) makes sense, but we don't put 17 locks on out front door, and most people (Where I live) don't carry a gun.

Some people might, and may have good reason to, but using Gmail when the NSA is listening doesn't seem any more insane than having a casual conversation in Starbucks when cops are listening.

Thracka951,"I’m a network security engineer and the only home automation I do is stuff where there is limited to no risk to my privacy or the security of my home.

What I do have is on completely separate VLANs so if you compromise my lights you can’t get into my home network or thermostats, etc.

TerawattX,"&gt;Who is going to do that?

Why do people run DoS attacks against MMO servers?  The most likely scenario is someone writing a script to prove it can be done, then sharing it online.  I doubt it would be used by someone looking to go on a crime spree and rob every house they can find - but you might have some creep use it to break into the home of someone they're obsessed with.  

I'm not worrying someone is going to rob me blind, but the gaps in security are concerning enough that I'll wait until a few more kinks are worked out - both in code and in design - before I adopt.  Same reason people wait until v X.1 to update instead of jumping straight into X.0.

As for the Google/Amazon stuff - I don't have anything to hide, and I'm not concerned about someone digging up dirt on me - I just like my privacy.  When I'm out in public that's one thing, but in my own living room is another.  Sure there's almost a 0% chance any contractor who might be getting paid to listen to the conversation and transcribe it, but that doesn't mean I want them to hear some private conversation between me and my wife.  

I also am not super keen on the device capturing audio for use in market analytics.  I don't Amazon presenting ads for Charmin because it over heard me complaining about the quality of TP we bought last time we went to the store.

Default usernames and passwords, or worse hardcoded admin usernames and passwords, insecure configurations, lazy implementation of security standards, or security that is arbitrary to bypass and not only allows for owning of the product, but grants the adversary a foothold on your home network as well.

There is also a rough cost to refil the tank with an embedded link to my oil supplier's website - I'd like to get real-time pricing for this eventually but not a priority at the moment, just a guide price
* External temperatures (Nest weather and some SmartThings contact sensors modified to extend battery life due to batteries not lasting in colder temperatures (using 2xAA's instead of the CR2032)
* Electric (month to date) estimated cost based on my suppliers rates
* Salt (water softener) usage and last changed date. This was acheived by repurposing an Amazon dash button placed next to the water softener. There is a simple ping script that looks for the dash button on my network (it has a static IP assigned by the Ubiquiti kit) and I just press that every time I change the salt. The level in this section actually relates to the heating oil but ultimately would like to put an ultrasonic sensor on the softener
* Motion/contact sensors - a mixture of SmartThings sensors and Fibaro and Aeotec. Also provide temperatures and the Fibaro/Aeotec also provide humidity, UV and lux
* More power stats, graphed (from the Aeotec HEM and a couple of SmartThings plugs)
* More temperature/humidity/setpoints (I have tado radiator valves on all rads in the house, except the bathroom)  

   * Note - I bought Nest before tado and havn't wanted to splash the cash on tado's boiler control offering yet - there is a simple WebCore script that monitors the rad temps and sets demand (sets Nest to 25 degrees) when needed and cancels the request when all rads are satisfied (sets Nest to 15 degrees). Would like to simplifiy this but will require spending \~£150 on tado kit and ebaying the Nest - I was lucky enough to have the API in place before Nest's cutoff but no idea how long that will last given the Google takeover - they may force my hand at some point
* Luminance graph (this is in a logrithmic scale and I use it to feed into whether lights should come on in certian rooms on motion sensors - also a good indication of ""free heating"" as it's a south facing house which can alter the setpoints)

* Underneath the bathroom temp chart there is a view on the bathroom extractor fan - this is a cheap Sonoff device that is triggered by a combination of factors; time of day, current humidity, motion and also another repurposed Dash button for when you are, erm, spending ""extended"" amounts of time on the toilet

Maalareve,"I'd suggest reading Edward Snowden's new book ""Permanent Record"". It would be 'tin foil hat' if it wasn't actually true. That's what's so terrifying about what our government has done and is continuing to do. I'm not paranoid like ""omg someone is watching me"" but I definitely do like my own privacy, as should ever person. Right now my entire home network is under an encrypted VPN. Utilize Tor heavily and have many monikers online to protect my own identity. I do use youtube, and my search engine is duckduckgo, but I utilize TAILS on the TOR network, along with my VPN connection and encrypted communication for research.  


Unfortunately, I've spent years setting up my Smart Home without a care in the world where my data is going and/or who has access to my data. Google in general is pretty much owned under three NSA 'top secret' programs: PRISM, XKEYSCORE, and UPSTREAM, making them completely untrustworthy, as well as pretty much any other proprietary software/hardware company. This makes maintaining any kind of level of privacy extremely difficult, as finding third party solutions for proprietary advancements is difficult to say the least. Ultimately, if I can't rework google home mini to operate completely offline and locally, then I will have to end up selling it and making my very own hand-made solution. I'm already in the process of getting rid of SmartThings in favor of Home Assistant for this very reason as well.  


As a note on encryption, just simply encryption isn't enough to maintain a decent level of privacy. You need both \*strong\* encryption as well as anonymity. I'm currently working on a project which would prevent government agencies like the NSA from tapping into the ISPs and reading tor entry and exit time logs, as was done by the FBI to catch one of the Anonymous Hackers.  


Yeah, it does sound a bit tin foil hat like, but, it'd be so much nicer in the world if we didn't have to do this bullshit just to be private and safe with our communications, but the mere fact that it exists is reason enough for me to want to protect myself. It's more a pride in our Constitutional Rights thing than it is some kind of vendetta or paranoia. The fact that government agencies can lookup literally your entire life, everything you've ever done, every email you've ever sent, wherever you walked, drove to, whoever you texted and what you texted about, listen to your actual phone calls, remotely access your web cams and online cameras and TV's, and all without a warrant and without your knowledge or approval...it's absolutely mortifying, which is why I want to make a difference.

csg6117,"I use Xiaomi Aqara sensors (Temperature, Flood, Door &amp; Motion) with [Zigbee2MQTT](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and the [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/home-assistant-companion/id1099568401) which is integrated to [NodeRed](https://nodered.org/). This runs on a Raspberry PI and has been very stable for me since I set it all up, nearly a year now.

Home Assistant deals with getting the data from the MQTT server, NodeRed is used to set up notifications / triggers in any way you'd want.

One thing to bear in mind, if one of the sensors does go offline or runs out of battery, the MQTT server can send a [last will and testament message](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17270863/mqtt-what-is-the-purpose-or-usage-of-last-will-testament) which is sent by the MQTT server if the device goes offline for any amount of time so it does not rely on the device sending anything before it dies.

I've not had any problems with battery levels not reporting or batteries running out as someone else reported. (I've had all of the sensors nearly a year now.)

This is all straightforward to get set up. Home assistant and NodeRed can be a bit of a learning curve but it does a huge amount of things and integrates to hundreds of other products/systems. Home assistant can also link to security cameras and could be made to send you a photo of the basement if there was a problem, even turning the lights on to take the photo if needed.

It's all fairly cheap. Xiaomi Aqara Zigbee sensors range from $5-$20 from places like AliExpress, Gearbest, Banggood etc.

Using Zigbee2MQTT, Home Assistant &amp; NodeRed also means there's no privacy issues as they're all open source.

I've learnt a lot from a couple of YouTube channels, [The Hook Up](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2gyzKcHbYfqoXA5xbyGXtQ/videos) and [Dr Zzs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7G4tLa4Kt6A9e3hJ-HO8ng)",1567973775,ezl95mb,t3_d13wd7,t3_d13wd7,/r/homeautomation/comments/d13wd7/water_leak_sensor/ezl95mb/,1,homeautomation

Oceans890,"General review from the Times on mesh nets: https://thewirecutter.com/blog/wi-fi-router-good-as-mesh/

They didn't review Google, but in my experience and a number of reviews, Google was the easiest to set up but performed the worst in throughput in comparison.

I'm using Eero these days. Downsides are, can't force separate 2.4 from 5, and Amazon associated if you are a privacy concerned person but somehow too lazy to configure your DNS. Upsides are easy set up, Alexa integration, great performance, and can get push notifications for devices joining the network. I don't want to be log monitoring but I do want to know when someone is on my net and the Eero dashboard for that is great.

To counterpoint the post recommending hardwiring a bunch of access points, keep in mind that a great benefit of mesh is being passed to the correct beacon as you move around your house, and dumb APs do not facilitate that. That's not important for your smart TV, but you may find your phone struggling to hang on to the upstairs wifi when your in the basement because it still has one bar.

Most mesh systems have hardwireable nodes (1 per kit or buy more separately) if throughput is a concern.

My lights are set to turn on and off at certain times - for instance, my bathroom and two lights in my kitchen turn on, all dimmed, in the morning.  I have an old-timey programmable coffee maker that turns on at the same time - no need for a smart device there.  I have chickens that need to be put away at night, and one of my Hue bulbs blinks to remind me, while my Koogeek changes to an obnoxious color, so if I don’t notice the blinking light, I will definitely notice that one.  

I also have an Ecobee 3 with two room temp sensors, which helped me determine the best amount to open each of the vents in my house to ensure all the rooms are roughly the same temperature, and I created automations in IFTTT that are keyed to Weather Underground, so that it automatically raises the temperature in my house to a sustainable temperature when it gets so hot that my AC wouldn’t otherwise turn off - as a result, my AC runs about 5 hours fewer than it would otherwise!

For entertainment, I have a Homepod in the dining room, and an Apple TV hooked up to my TV.  The TV is a smart TV, though I don’t use its fancy features, as it is set to automatically display the Apple TV’s input.  I do have four google home minis, but I hardly use them since I got the Homepod, and plan to re-evaluate them once iOS 13 comes out, as many of its promised features may negate their usefulness to me.  Mind you, I actually do find them to be incredibly robust and cool devices, but I have issues with their privacy history, and the Homepod integrates better with my other Apple devices, anyway.  For music, I bought a couple old Airport Expresses, which were recently updated to support Airplay 2, meaning I can have multi-room music that is perfectly synchronized throughout my house.  I may buy one or two more of those, as one room doesn’t have one, and I’ve thought about sticking one in my shed and getting a loud stereo out there - probably nothing fancy because I don’t want to be out much if it gets stolen.

Lastly, I found my wife’s old iPhone 5c in a drawer, and I attached it to a wall in the large area that comprises our kitchen, dining room, and living room.  Using iOS’s guided access feature, I have it permanently set to the Home app, allowing guests to control our lights without needing to know the names of specific lights or having to get over the learning curve of smart assistants.  

All of this was gotten on the cheap except the Homepod.  There have been some insane deals in the last couple of years on this stuff, and some of it I got used.  All of it started with me being annoyed at the light switch placement in my house, and not wanting to run new wiring.

I do this for a couple of reasons; if one service goes down and stops being supported (not unheard of) then there are other options. Equally, if one is found to be a major privacy breach, or something equally unsavoury, I can remove that service and continue with other provider. Finally, if one of the services brings out something really killer, I can easily switch to that one.

At the moment I have it centred around HomeKit. I find the ability to use my phone as a remote for a lot of the house is useful. However, I am considering getting some Echo dots, as sometimes getting my phone out is a pain (first world problems hey) and I’d like to be able to just talk out loud. There is nothing stopping me running both HomeKit and Alexa, as they read the status of the devices.

Twat_The_Douche,"1. Stair lights

I have an led strip that is set to blue and 10% brightness that runs along the baseboard of my stairs going upstairs. At the top of the stairs is a motion sensor that when activated, will check the Lux and if below a certain value, will trigger the stair leds to activate. They will remain on for 1inute after the motion sensor has stopped detecting motion then the LEDs will turn off. No more dark stairs at night and no need to turn on a bright hall light to see.

2. Garage door

I have hs-wd200 light switches on the main floor. When the garage door is open, one switch in each room will have a single red led indicator blink. After 2 hours, google home will announce (just once) that the garage has been opened for over 2 hours. At 10pm google will also announce (just once) that the garage is still open. After midnight the auto close sequence is initiated. No more garage left open all night.

3. Sleep walkers

My kids sleepwalk. I added door sensors to their bedroom doors that will turn on an indicator on the main floor hs-wd200 switches if their door opens between 8pm and 7am. This helps me recognize when they leave, which door it was, and if I'm watching something inappropriate on tv that could be scary for them, I have time to pause. It also dings a chime in my bedroom in case I'm sleeping, and I can check up on them. No more sleep walking while I'm asleep!   (Note, this uses door sensors because I don't believe in cameras in a bedroom, they deserve their privacy)

4. Coffee maker

I have a dumb coffeemaker attached to a zigbee plug. Once activated, a 4 hour timer starts and will shut it off after 4 hours. No more burnt coffee running all day.

5. Lights

My living room has a custom built shelf ceiling with an led strip running around the room. My hs-wd200 lights are voice activated using google, as are the leds in the ceiling shelf. I can change the led color, brightness, or on/off by voice also. I've setup scenes for evening mode, day mode, and movie lights by voice.

None of the above. Cloud based stuff does and will get shut down all the time. You have no control over that, and the devices become worthless and you might no longer be able to control the items in your home. Stringify, Nest, Leeo, Iris, and countless others are examples of this.

Maybe even worse is the privacy aspect of cloud based stuff. You have no idea how they are using your information or who they are selling/giving it to. It might all be innocent for internal quality control, or it could be going into a government server someplace (or anything in between) and you would have no control over it.

Aud4c1ty,"Since there seems to be so much confusion around the privacy of video in the Neighbors App, I thought I'd Google That For You™.

&gt;**How is my information and content kept private on the Neighbors App?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ring will continue to innovate on behalf of our customers to help make neighborhoods safer. We will do so with our customers, their privacy and the security of their information at the top of our priority list. We know that our customers place a huge amount of trust in us, and we have every intention of continuing to earn that trust.  
&gt;  
&gt;Users have full control of who views their Ring footage. Only the content that a user chooses to make publicly available on Neighbors (by posting it to the App) can be viewed via the Neighbors App or by local law enforcement. Users can choose to share text updates, photos and videos taken on any device, including but not limited to Ring’s home security devices. Only content that a Neighbors user chooses to share on the Neighbors App is publicly accessible through the Neighbors App or by your local law enforcement. Ring does not view or share a user’s videos that are not posted to the App without the user’s express permission or a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.  
&gt;  
&gt;We do not display personal information like names in the Neighbors App, and we do not share personal information with other users of the App.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**How does the Neighbors App work with law enforcement?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Neighbors partners with local law enforcement so they can share official, important crime and safety updates and work together with their local community to build trust and make neighborhoods safer. We are proud to have partnerships with many law enforcement agencies across the country. When new law enforcement agencies come on board, we announce the partnership in-app via a regional announcement so users are aware. We’ve also taken care to design these partnerships in a way that keeps users in control.  
&gt;  
&gt;When using Neighbors, law enforcement see the same interface that all users see; the content is the same, the exact locations of posts are obfuscated, and the user’s personal identity is not displayed. There are two key differences, though: 1) law enforcement can view public posts from within their jurisdiction (instead of just their ‘neighborhood’) and 2) law enforcement posts are identified so users can clearly see that they are the source of the content. This means that posts or comments made by law enforcement are clearly marked with their official title and name.  
&gt;  
&gt;Law enforcement can only view the publicly available content in the Neighbors App, unless a user explicitly and voluntarily chooses to share their own recordings with law enforcement. Exact locations of devices and user information are never provided to law enforcement without a user’s express permission or a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Law enforcement can request information from users within their jurisdiction (Ring sends the official request to users). Law enforcement must reference a relevant case number in order to make a request within a specific, limited time range and area. Ring will then ask a targeted group of users in that area if they are willing to share any relevant footage with law enforcement. It’s then up to the user to share their video file(s) or decline the request. Users can also opt out of all future requests by law enforcement. Again, Ring will not release user information without a user’s express permission or a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.

attunezero,"I have used a lot of the automation hubs on the market and IMO Hubitat is far far ahead of any of the competition. Some problems with ST that hubitat solves:

* ST is online only. All events must make a round trip to their servers (for no good reason) for any action to happen. This causes lag and their cloud service frequently has outages and bugs. This means automations randomly don't work which sucks. It also sucks for your privacy -- why do they want all the events in your home to go through their servers? I'm guessing they datamine and sell that info. Hubitat is all local and private.
* ST's default automation capabilities are really weak. You can't do much more than a simple ""if/then"" without installing a custom automation application, but custom apps have problems on ST because they are forced to run on their cloud. Hubitat has an immensely powerful built in automation app (and the best lighting control app I've ever seen).
* Bugs in ST can go a loooong time without fixes. Hubitat gets significant updates very frequently, once or twice a month, and the developers are super responsive.
* If you need to install a driver for a device it's a fairly complicated pain in ST. In Hubitat it's really easy and there are tons of quality community drivers. Hubitat was created as a solution for the problems with ST so it can even share code with ST drivers.

The only thing I can think of that ST does better than Hubitat is that the app is prettier. Hubitat's automation capabilities are so good however that I find I pretty much never use the app.

dono2081,"Advice I would give will vary based on a lot of details:

* What country are you in?
* What cell phone type do you own?
* What automation devices do you already have or have a preference for? Alexa (Amazon), Siri/Homekit (Apple), other?
* What restrictions / limitations do you already know about with regard to automation? Not all automation systems work in all countries.
* How interested are you in home automation more generally? Do you like to tinker? Do you see yourself expanding your home automation tools widely throughout your apartment?
* What kind of budget are you on for this (and future) project(s)?

These answers will really change the direction of any solutions. Having said that, here we go:

Version 1: You don't have a lot of interest in home automation and just want lights to come on when you get home. Solution: Get a lamp and an extension cord. Put the lamp near the front door and turn it on when you step into the house. Variation: Get a wireless switch and place that at the front entrance; this switch will then control the power to a lamp, uplight or sconce you mount at the ""T"" of your hallway.

Version 2: You might want to dabble, but affordably, and you have access to a range of solutions. Solution: Go to IKEA and look into their smart light solutions. Save your receipts. Play around with their solutions and return what you don't like. Also look into Elgato Eve sensors (motion and open/closed options available) and enjoy stepping in to a new hobby. Bonus: Buy a Wemo or competitor smart plug (if available for your country).

Version 3: You want to go super-crazy, with lots of automated functionality and money is no object. Solution: Pick one of the big platforms (Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple Homekit) and go nuts. Spend many enjoyable hours learning about the technology of each. Start to have opinions about things like security, privacy, etc. Decide if you want to step into the Reality Distortion Field of Apple and buy some HomePods, Apple TVs, etc. (This solution may be best if you already have one or more Apple products since you're already familiar with their ecosystem.)

Version 4: Insanity mode. It's three years from now and you have 8 Homepods, 5 Amazon Echos, and one Google Home, as well as 40-odd bulbs, switches, sockets and sensors. You are hoping for automated window blinds for Christmas. Your August door lock unlocks as you arrive, the Eve sensor triggers lights throughout your home. You've replaced your Nest thermostat with the Ecobee with 4 sensors throughout the home, because the Ecobee is compatible with HomeKit. Your garage door is voice operated. You worry that someone might steal the smart lightbulbs lighting the alley outside your home, but the colors are so cool it's worth it.

SirEDCaLot,"Another case of Nest 'you will use your devices how we think you should, not how you think you should'.  

First case- Nest thermostats.  The 'eco' mode for heat (what it switches to when you're away) can be turned up pretty high.  But the eco mode for AC can only go down to 76°F, no lower.  So if you have pets at home, and there's a lot of humidity outside, hope those pets don't need to be comfortable OR hope you don't want to save money with eco mode.  
They have been repeatedly asked to address this since before Nest was a Google product.  

Second case- recently they announced the 'works with Nest' API would go away, and force everybody to move to 'works with Google Home' API.  That's all fine except the WWGH API doesn't feed much info BACK to other services.  Like for example, home/away status.  This is supposedly done to protect your privacy, because letting *other* companies know when you're home or away will violate your privacy.  It of course ignored that there are a HUGE number of 3rd party integrations that depend on that stuff- for example automations that turn off lights and arm alarms when you are 'away'.  According to a few people who called to complain, even the Google support reps admitted that the people who made this decision were surprised by the backlash and had no idea how people were actually using their products.  

Third case- this here.  We don't trust you to deal with your own privacy, so we will force your camera to glow when it records.  Literally NO other camera does this.  And if you see a camera, you should assume someone is watching it.  
As many others have stated, forcing the light on will reveal the camera location to potential burglars and other people who you want to record.  And also, this 'improvement' is easily defeated with a piece of black tape.

I personally wouldn't use a device like that, it's a terrible idea for more reasons than I have time to list.

That being said, it does not have any manual user configured band steering capability. Read the manual, reviews, etc... it's not there. The smart plugs mentioned are also not so smart, as they don't have much logic in them other than what's needed to control their relay and connect to WiFi. Their associated smart phone app is what does the heavy lifting for them, but of course the app doesn't have to be running on the same local network 24/7 for the plugs to function so the capability for those devices to know that they need to wait &gt; reject 5ghz &gt; make sure they remain connected to 2.4, instead of just disconnecting from the network altogether is not gonna be there.

MSFTBear,"&gt;	Cortana can even meet HIPAA and FERPA is configured in an enterprise enviroment, and are nearly there already if you're an O365 subscriber

This doesn’t matter from a **smart home** perspective. Not to mention Cortana can only hookup to about 8 smart home skills. 

&gt;	Also: Cortana and Siri don't tweak their answers according to how their parent companies want them to come out. Both Alexa and GA will lean their general answers towards what serves the political interest of Amazon and Alphabet.

That is true for Siri, but not for Apple. Microsoft does use your browsing history and search history to “personalize” experiences. 

Source: Cortana beta tester since 2013. 

As for political affiliation, Alexa only plays what you choose to add to it. If you’re using it as a smart home hub, this doesn’t matter and if it does, you can tweak it. Google Assistant learns from your Chrome history and what you search for. If you search a bunch of anti-democrat/anti-whatever, it’s going to show you it. 

As for Cortana, she uses Bing News which can be tweaked for specific interests. However, it does lean towards the right.

For Siri, if you use Apple News and the podcast app, she’ll personalize some requests. An example, “hey Siri, play some news”. 


&gt;	Siri integrates with HomeKit you have a single pane of glass for management, which is very nice, but natural voice recognition needs much more help as well as general knowledge integration. 

Siri is great when it comes to privacy due to it never really learning your habits outside of Apples services. However, HomeKit is mediocre and limited in automation, what the OP is trying to do.

As for the second part, if you’re talking about knowledge on the user, you can’t do that without personal information. 

If you’re taking about questions, this is true for Google Assistsnt because the instant answer thing google does. It will take the first result and read it out. It’s not always true.

As for Alexa, Amazon does automate some questions, but if you read the history on Alexa, it originally started as a service to give you the right answers to questions instead of what’s clicked on.


&gt;	Cortana has debatably the least integration with HA products, but is the most privacy oriented, and you usually already have it on a PC anyway. 

As someone who lives in breathes Microsoft (hence my username), you’re full of shit. As stated, Cortana uses information like how much you open an app, what you search on bing and how you interact with other Microsoft services to personalize. I like Cortana, but let’s not pretend she’s not gobbling information.

&gt;	It's also almost as good as Google (within testing error) for natural language recognition, and as good for general questions.

For some questions, yes. For more other ones, no. Microsoft launched a part of bing service called “Bing Distill”. This allowed its users to create answers to questions.

The officers themselves are also targeted as potential customers, with company reps handing out $50 “law enforcement discount” codes that, supposedly, can only be redeemed using a city email address.

Which seems to incentivize officers selling the product. But that's kind of the point here, right?

Further, of course there are discounts and such involved. That's a good thing, right?

SirEDCaLot,"This is an interesting idea.  However there are a lot of gotchas here.  

A light up key, by itself, is not horribly useful.  It's basically just a 'tile' type tracker built into a key, which is cool I guess, and is an easy impulse purchase at $6, but I don't see it solving a specific problem other than lost keys.  At the $6 price point it'd be fine as a basic lost key thing (like Tile), just put a button so you can make it glow manually, and you have a simple and cheap dual function product.  Not shark tank worthy I don't think but I'd probably grab one on Amazon.  

You also have a LOT of different keyways to support- meaning you either build the thing so the user integrates their existing key into the product, or you have to have different versions for different keyways (IE Kwikset, Schlage, Baldwin, etc).  

For the 'smart key' feature- first, the key itself is made out of metal, which will give you a real challenge if you're doing Qi wireless charging.  Inductive charging like Qi (what phones use) will interact with metal and potentially cause a problem.  Charging my key is also not something i think of as a thing that needs doing.  And the coil will be a real challenge to build, because most people will want to just toss their keychain on the Qi pad.  
The real issue with that though is what it can interact with.  If it just lights up when I get home, that doesn't help me and is NOT worth installing an app (and associated privacy violations) for.  If it interacted with my home automation system (HomeSeer for me, but lots of people use other things) so I can click the button on the key twice and if I'm within 1/10th mile of my house it unlocks the front door and opens the garage door, that has some use.",1561647005,es6dtu8,t3_c63b3t,t3_c63b3t,/r/homeautomation/comments/c63b3t/need_opinions_if_my_bluetooth_smartkey_product_is/es6dtu8/,3,homeautomation
itomeshi,"The idea is solid, IMO. However, there are a few things that would help both the pitch and the product's utility:

* It appears that the light is bright enough that, if gripping the key normally and pointing toward the door, it can help me visually line up the key in near-complete darkness. Is this correct?
* What is your privacy policy? Is your app sharing/selling any data? Is your data stored on a server, or set up locally? Many people want their location data private, and at the same time many people don't want to lose their config if their phone dies. Personally, I'd prefer you give up that revenue stream. :)
* Play up that the basic version has a replaceable battery and the pro's is rechargable. Unlike somewhat similar products (Tile), this means that the device isn't as disposable.
* Do you plan to make key-less 'indicator' versions?
* I would mention less the 'bothering neighbors' advantage, simply because most neighbors won't have a problem with outdoor lights. The 'discrete' aspect is good, though.
* Are you planning on partnering with any retail chains for distribution? If you could pick this up directly at one of more stores that cut keys - Lowe's, Home Depot, Walmart - that makes buying in MUCH easier.
* Is there any plan to introduce a model with LED color selection or vibration?
* How durable is the key? Have you subjected these to physical testing? Is there a gimmicky video of you smacking it with a hammer, dropping it on the ground 30 times, etc?
* How does the light on the key get turned off, and how tight can I make the WiFi and GPS zones? If I need to use the app to shut off the light, that's annoying. If I can squeeze the key or it's timed, that MIGHT be better.

The UI is called Lovelace and is simple to manually code but can also be configured via the GUI. I've attached my current Lovelace setup which controls a mix of Lutron Caseta switches, Lifx bulbs, Harmony, Ring Security and TP-Link Kasa outlets. You can write automations in Home Assistant or Node-RED via an add-on. 

If I was starting fresh today, I would go with z-wave devices as much as possible to have full local (and fast) control and avoid the cloud altogether. If you're privacy concious, there's an add-on for Hass.io called Snips.ai that gives you local voice control. 

There is an official app for iOS and one coming soon for Android. Ariela Pro is a excellent 3rd party option for Android that's available now. Installing the mobile apps on all of your users devices will give you presence detection that's useful for automations. The app can be pinned on a tablet so your users can't accidentally leave control surface. For the tablets, I think you'd be better off getting a nice table stand and setting them in convenient locations in your home.. side table in living room, nightstand, kitchen counter. You'll lose the convenience if you have to get off the couch to use it and will resort to voice commands.

MisterSnuggles,"Cameras can be made private.  I have a mix of cameras, all on their own VLAN which can't access the internet, and use Blue Iris for NVR duties.  For remote access, I have a VPN server set up (most routers will do this out of the box).  For privacy, there's only one indoor camera pointed at living space and its outlet is on a wall switch.

For pet feeders, I agree with other commenters that simpler is better.  If you can free-feed your cat that's easiest.  If you're feeding wet food (which you should be!) then a simple timer-based feeder that seals well is best.  I've read about IoT ones that stopped feeding when the cloud service was inaccessible - that's the last thing you want to happen.  A battery-powered feeder is basically a requirement if you're going the automation route.

Monitoring the food intake is something that many people don't think about, but it's a really good thing to do.  One of my cats was losing weight so I put a camera up to see how much he was eating, I ended up switching foods because I could see that he didn't like what I was feeding.  If you're going to go the locally-hosted route like I have, you really only need the cheapest camera with IR (cats are quite active at night) that works with the software.  If you go cloud for your cameras, Wyzecams are incredibly cheap and there's no reason not to have one on the food.

For temperature sensors, I've built a bunch using ESPHome and BMP280s.  They work very well, but you may need some infrastructure (Home Assistant most likely) to support it.

No.

The only thing that it may request is weather info for the day, and it will poll to see if my phone is connected to the network or not (so that way it can perform certain functions once it finds that I am gone or home, through my phone's MAC address). 

Either way, the goal is to have my Home Automation devices only talk to my server, and my server only talks to them. No data is collected or leaked out, and data collected has a limited life span and visibility (aka the fucking devices don't track my habits to leak to Google. What a massive privacy invasion!)

They quoted me between 17~21K CAD to cover 13 windows of honeycomb style shades with full auto motor and HomeKit integration. I ghosted them after that because my bank account isn't ready for that kind of automation.

Beyond that, invest in one ecosystem that makes sense for you and your family. That is, if you guys are all Apple devices, consider buying all into HomeKit as opposed to some HomeKit and some Alexa and some Google. You can do it, there are tools like HomeAssistant that can help, but you're going to be tied to whim of random developer contributing their module, or have to code a bunch of stuff yourself. 

If you buy into HomeKit, you'll also want to invest in good WiFi, as HomeKit doesn'tx do Z-Wave/Zigbee out of the gate. Koolaid drinkers will tell you that you shouldn't use WiFi for IOT and they'll come up with a bunch of reasons, but at the end of the day, if you have several good hard wired access points at good locations around the house, you're going to be just fine. That said HomeKit stuff tends to be like all other Apple products and has a premium mark up, so if that's the route you're going to take, your bank account will be dinged a bit more... but you do get what you pay for in this space, so that's entirely up for you to decide.

You've mentioned Nest earlier... If you buy into Nest, you'll probably lose a lot of integrations moving forward as Google is slowly killing that platform for some unknown reason in the guise of privacy. If you don't have API project and key setup by a certain date, you won't be able to tie it into other systems VIA typical DIY channels, ever. So be careful.

Another tip is to try to stick with one vendor if at all possible. At least for the same ""thing"".  That is, if possible avoid getting WeMo dimmers and Lutron light switches; because you'll end up needing to track down vendor app for each. Not to also mention, you might not have to touch them anymore, but you'll still see them regularly on your wall, and a mix mash of switches gets unsightly pretty quick.

You are essentially trading in for Google's walled garden, at least with Apple's semi walled garden of HomeKit you can make other devices work with some 3rd party software.  Look for devices that work with platforms like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) and consolidate around that.  iOS isn't really your problem here, Google limiting integration with others on Nest is.  With the Nest API you could make Nest work with HomeKit pretty easily, but you won't be able to going forward.

The recent announcement that the Nest API was going away showed that they have no idea how people use their devices- namely that a lot of people have their own automation with Nest as a small part, not with Google or Alexa as the core.  Furthermore, while privacy is a noble goal (and if you believe it's their goal I have a bridge to sell you) this is not about letting people protect *their* data, it's about putting Google in a place to decide who people are allowed to share *their* data with.  And with everything now going through Google Assistant, Google can now collected an increasingly detailed lifestyle graph on anyone with a Nest.  

Plus, from what I've read about this local processing stuff, it's more about improving command latency than giving anybody any more control over their own devices.

SmarterHome,"Yea it can run on pretty much anything. Only need a beefier setup if you  start doing image processing and stuff like that. You just need to buy a zwave or zigbee usb stick to add that radio to your setup. I recommend the aeotec zwave stick and the conbee 2 zigbee stick, I use them and they work great. 

I use Alexa and I prefer it to google assistant for voice control but honestly you can’t go wrong with either since all the automations are taken care of within home assistant. If you want to setup your own voice assistant for privacy concerns you can do that too with snips.ai

WiFi and zigbee networks are separate so you won’t have any congestion issues. They share the same frequency (2.4ghz)  unless your WiFi is 5ghz, so the only concern is interference...but this usually isn’t a problem. If it is you can simply place your WiFi and zigbee on different channels and that should resolve any potential interference. 

You can create a nice custom dashboard with the homeassistant Lovelace UI if you want to create some wall panel control centers which is something still on  my todo list.

SirEDCaLot,"No.  What I'm saying is, they want to create a one-way API so that you HAVE to use Assistant.  

WWN = useful two-way API that allows anyone (with authorization) to both send commands and read status.  So for example, my Fitbit watch can tell me if Nest is home or away, and for each thermostat what the ambient temp is, what the set temp is, and humidity.  I can then send it commands, including selecting home or away, and adjusting the temperature.  

WWGA = one-way API that allows anyone (with authorization) to send commands, but WON'T send status or other info.  Basically an Alexa that doesn't answer questions.  So I can send it a command like 'set the living room to 70°F' but it won't tell me what the current living room temperature is or what my thermostat set point is or whether the thing is set to home or away.  This is ostensibly to protect my privacy.  

The problem here is that if my 3rd party integrated system can't read status info out of my Nest, it can't act on that info.  So to use my Fitbit as an example, it wouldn't be able to tell me if Nest is in home or away mode, wouldn't be able to tell me the current set point or current ambient temperature or humidity.  
And if I was using a 3rd party automation system, I couldn't then use that data.  For example if I have a nice HomeSeer or Home Assistant type system, I can't display the current Nest set point on a touch screen interface because WWGA won't provide that info by API.  

I also can't make events on that data because my HA system will never get it.  For example I might have an event like 'if the living room humidity is above 60% then set Nest to AC mode at 68°'.  

The result is that I'll be forced to go through Google for functionality I get from other places now.  To see the current temp I can't just check the Fitbit watch, because WWGA won't give info out to Fitbit.  I have to use a Google app on my phone.

SirEDCaLot,"&gt; every hop requires the radio to receive and retransmit the signal back out, which adds delay. If you have good WiFi setup properly blanket the coverage area, then the response time could be much faster than that of a repeated signal.

We're talking milliseconds here.  If I push the button and the light comes on in 100ms instead of 10ms, I probably won't notice the difference.  I don't think that extra latency is a serious tradeoff when the mesh coverage is the benefit.  

&gt; A Zigbee/ZWave hub can essentially be thought of as a physical VLAN tagged port. Setting up devices in their own isolated VLAN and block out internet access is privacy steps that should be taken regardless of how things are implemented.   

Not quite.  Z-Wave devices don't get raw Internet access.  They can't initiate connections out to external servers or accept connections from the outside other than commands like on/off/status.  They aren't tiny little computers running embedded network OSes; they don't have vulnerabilities of the sort that could be network exploited and even if they did have Z-Wave protocol weaknesses that would at most grant access to the rest of the Z-Wave network (but such a thing is nearly impossible).  And when you plug a Z-Wave device in for the first time, it won't celebrate that fact by immediately reaching out to some crappy cloud server.  
Point is- VLAN isolated or not, there's a much smaller target / threat profile from a Z-Wave device than a WiFi device.  
Besides, most people don't know how to do VLANs or firewalls.  

&gt; For my WiFi devices, most of them follow the open HomeKit standard from Apple  

Those are not the devices I'm talking about.  I don't like HomeKit's relatively closed ecosystem, but from what I've read of the protocol its security and privacy controls are quite good, and compatibility within the HomeKit ecosystem is also good.  
The devices I'm talking about are things like WiFi light bulbs that use some random vendor's app and cloud connection.",1557888690,enjzuak,t3_bnxrsx,t1_enhv1ab,/r/smarthome/comments/bnxrsx/my_gf_thinks_i_may_have_a_problem/enjzuak/,1,smarthome
chiisana,"Not saying Z-Wave is bad; just want to point out a few counter-arguments as food for thought:

1. Mesh is great if you have hard to reach places, however, every hop requires the radio to receive and retransmit the signal back out, which adds delay. If you have good WiFi setup properly blanket the coverage area, then the response time could be much faster than that of a repeated signal.
2. A Zigbee/ZWave hub can essentially be thought of as a physical VLAN tagged port. Setting up devices in their own isolated VLAN and block out internet access is privacy steps that should be taken regardless of how things are implemented. Yes, a physical device does make it a bit easier than VLAN tagging.
3. For my WiFi devices, most of them follow the open HomeKit standard from Apple, and does not require the vendor app on my phone. Even if the vendor goes the way of the dodos, the devices should still be able to function w/o regard for the vendor (I use should, because theoretically, the firmware could be broken AF and have a blocking call back to vendor servers before processing HomeKit API commands. Though, I highly doubt that's the case or Apple wouldn't allow them to use the HomeKit certified badge).
4. Everything is done locally with HomeKit. Nothing have to leave my house or network for the command to be processed. I can do IFTTT if I want cloud-to-device functionality (i.e.: flash the lights if I get an email notifying me a Nigerian prince want to give me bazillion cash monies), but I can do all my automation w/o any cloud directly using HomeKit.

That all said, I do understand HomeKit devices tends to come at a premium. For example, my light switches are around $80 a pop whereas cheap WeMo are going for $40 or less, and other cheap junk from China can be had for &lt;$10. But, you get what you paid for. So, I can understand if people are on a tight budget, and aren't interested to go down a specific rabbit hole, ZWave or ZigBee is great. However, for people like me, who run servers at home, VLAN for fun, and doesn't want to deal with an extra network, WiFi devices running HomeKit is a great choice for simplicity on an already rock solid foundation.",1557857563,enhv1ab,t3_bnxrsx,t1_enh2r4o,/r/smarthome/comments/bnxrsx/my_gf_thinks_i_may_have_a_problem/enhv1ab/,2,smarthome
SirEDCaLot,"I'm a fan of Z-Wave, not for any religious reason or because I'm a 'devotee'.  I dislike WiFi for technical reasons.  

1. WiFi devices are not mesh devices.  Each device needs a good signal back to the router or WAP.  Z-Wave or ZigBee are mesh networks- every device you add makes the network bigger and stronger.  

2. WiFi devices are connecting to a computer network and to the Internet.  That means they could be talking to any sort of cloud service, and unless I isolate them on a separate VLAN, could be a security threat to the rest of the network.  
As an IT person, it means I'm getting a tiny cheap often Chinese made thing and plugging it into my network, hoping (but having little or no way to verify) that it's built with security in mind, and isn't violating my privacy with some cloud communication or being exploited by someone due to unpatched firmware issues.  

3. WiFi devices don't follow any single set of standards.  WiFi HA equipment will generally require a manufacturer-specific phone app to set up, and there is no guarantee that any set of devices will talk to any other specific set of devices or how that communication takes place.  So you can have two WiFi devices in a house that won't talk to one another because their manufacturers don't have a partnership agreement in place.  

4. In many cases, integrating WiFi devices with other devices requires cloud-to-cloud connections like IFTTT.  For someone who dislikes relying on clouds, this is a problem.  If I push a button on a bedside remote, I don't want that signal to bounce off to a server 5 states away and back before turning the light on 5 feet away.

THAT ALL SAID, there are places where WiFi is a great application.  The big one is people who are new to HA, who want to get started with a simple setup cheaply and easily and don't want to research and buy a hub.  For someone like that, WiFi is a great choice.

nietzkore,"With my smart lock, I can use my phone to make sure my door is locked. Are you sure your door is locked? When you're on vacation. Or at work. Or in bed. I can be 100% positive regardless of my location. I can check from my phone and I can ask google assistant if specific devices are locked or not. 

I have a record of every time the door was unlocked and who used their personal code to unlock it. I can see how long the door was unlocked after someone opens the door. I can see when the lock was locked from the inside, and when the locking button outside was pressed. 

I can issue different, unique personal codes to every person I give access. I can disable or revoke any of those codes at any time. I can press a button in the app or on the lock to set privacy mode, disabling all active guest codes at any time. 

I never have to give out a copy of a physical key in order to let a guest or contractor into the house. Physical keys can potentially be given to someone else, lost, or a copy made at any time - leading to further security issues.

In that same vein, I can never be locked out of the house. The lock works with a dead battery, if you just set a 9-volt under it. It works without internet / electricity to the rest of the house with its internals only. In an emergency, I can grant access remotely to allow someone into the house.

The lock I have can't be unlocked unless you have a personal code (all but mine are temporary on my authority) or I have invited you to my account and you have app access (AKA no one else). You can't access Google to unlock it for you, it isn't a feature.

All of this makes my smart lock more secure for me than a physical lock. No one gets into the house without me knowing unless they broke glass or successfully smashed down the door, the door frame, and surrounding framing lumber. I have insurance for that. If someone uses software to infiltrate my lock and access the house, they could have done the same with a rock. Which are right outside the door in the flower beds. Glass isn't the last thing keeping the house secure.",1557375203,emw6ew5,t3_blubx0,t1_emsvzqr,/r/homeautomation/comments/blubx0/psa_dont_put_your_google_homealexa_near_a_window/emw6ew5/,1,homeautomation

dee_lio,"I LOVE Nest Protect. I have several ofthem hardwired (they have a battery backup). 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

\- Relatively easy to set up. You take a snappy of the barcode and it's pretty much programmed. They also have voice prompts to walk you through the process.

\- they have an optional motion sensing nightlight function. This is super handy, as I have one in a dark hallway.  I use it more often than I would have anticipated. No more stubbed toes if I get up in the middle of the night for a snack, and I don't want to turn on the bright hallway lights. It's optional (via the app), so you won't wake up your mate if you have a protect in your bedroom.

\- the app will notify you if a battery is failing, or if there is a fault. No strange beeping in the middle of the night from an unknown source.

\- to turn off the alarm, you can waive at it or use the app. This is super handy if your alarm is on a higher ceiling.

\- the alarms will notify you of a power outage

\- if you have a Nest thermostat, it will kill your a/c in the event of a smoke or CO alarm

\- There is an API to interface with your home control software (such as Indigo)

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- EXPENSIVE

\- You have to use an app to set them up, and they use the internet. (I know some people do not like that for privacy issues.)

\- EXPENSIVE

\- you will have an IP address assignment for each unit. I don't know how chatty the protocol is, as I use a separate wifi for home security stuff.

\- did I mention EXPENSIVE?

\- I don't like apps per se, and the communications are limited to the app. I'd prefer an email / text to tell me when something is amiss. I haven't figured out how to use their API to do that through indigo, yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Wishes:

\- I wish they would have offered a POE version, since I had to string power over to each unit anyway, it would have been nice to keep them off of the already crowded wifi (yes, I know they have their own mesh network). It just easier for me to string low voltage ethernet vs 110.

\-  a nice touch would have been to have the option to have them act as wifi repeaters, but I get why they don't.

\- bulk pricing. Seriously, can they get a better deal on 10 packs? (In case you didn't see earlier, they're expensive!)",1556982673,emhnt0o,t3_bkhkyg,t3_bkhkyg,/r/smarthome/comments/bkhkyg/smart_smoke_detector_recommendations/emhnt0o/,1,smarthome

Yeah I agree it isn't inherently bad. And sure there can be a symbiotic relationship between giving data in exchange for a service or better service. Google's services like GMail are a perfect example of this. And if your willingly giving that data out then sure there can be no invasion of privacy.

kaizendojo,"Well for me, besides the local control and privacy emphasis, it's the 'Rosetta Stone' factor.  I can use just about any platform out there and find a way to integrate it into HA.  Once it's in there, I can interact with it and use the data to automate things.  It's the difference between having a universal remote and having a truly smart home - I don't have to react, my home is proactive.

I have the following platforms, all connected and interactive within HA:

* Wink - Zigbee and Schlage
* Zwave
* Hue
* Google Home Hub/Minis
* Alexa Show, Dots and Classic V1 
* 2 Harmony Hubs
* Ring
* Wyze, Foscam and one Chinese no brand cam
* Multisensors I built myself with ESPHome
* An LED Strip controller I built with ESPHome
* Automatic Pro in my car
* My AcuRite 5 in 1 Weather Station
* My Bloomsky Sky1 Weather Station
* ecobee thermostat
* Deluge torrent client
* OctoPrint server for my 3D printer
* Waze
* Google Calendar
* Allergy and Air Quality data
* Local traffic/accident reports
* Weather Radar/Lightning Data
* Info on SpaceX and other rocket launches
...and at least a dozen other platforms.

All of these things interact with each other and can trigger things or report on things or announce themselves. They work with each other so I don't have to. If I leave one of the doors open or unlocked, I get a notification before I am more than 2-3 blocks away.  If I am running low on gas, the house tells me before I am scheduled to go somewhere.  If it starts to rain, the house tells me that I have windows open.  If I have an appointment and the traffic gets bad, the house tells me to leave earlier.  

Things like that are possible with HA that aren't either possible or easy with other platforms. I came into it knowing nothing about Linux, Zwave, etc.  I had never seen a Pi close up.  Now I have it running on a VM server and I've learned enough to be helping others and moderating forums and subreddits.

But I like learning new things and I have the time to put into it.  Not everyone does.  HA is easier than ever (I started in 2016 when it wasn't as friendly a UI or easy to install/configure.) but like anything there is a learning curve.  You can go as deep or as shallow as you want with HA nowadays, but I feel like it's worth it for the things I am able to do with it.  And the other major factor for me is the community of users and devs themselves.  I really enjoy every minute I am part of it.

Catsrules,"I just setup Hassio over the weekend. I found the add-on called Configurator very usefull. It is basically a web browser text editor, and limited file management. I think it is far easier to just use that instead of trying to setup SAMBA. 

As for the video, I think your being a little bit unfair to HA by focusing mostly on ease of use.  Yes it is no where near as easy as other options. I think we can all agree that HA defiantly has room for improvement on the GUI so that most tasks/automations don't require editing config files. 
But I would also like to point out that ease of use is not the main focus of HA. HA's website the clearly state ""Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first"". Unfortunately by the very nature of local control and privacy requires you take on more responsibility, thus less ease of use. You can't just plug something in and have Amazon or Google take care of it for you like you can with other solutions. In that regard HA is always going to lag behind other solutions. (

Speaking as someone who is brand new to HA (This weekend was my first time using it)  I will agree with you that I was disappointed when I realized I would have to start writing code to perform basic automation tasks. But I disagree with your statement about the lack of documentation. The Cookbook had very easy and very simple instructions, that I could modify to perform my tasks.

DecorationOnly,"Few other advantages of Hassio vs GH/Alexa:

1 - Local processing. Internet or cloud service interruptions will it happen. If something happens with the cloud service or internet connection with GH/Alexa, your automations immediately cease functioning

2 - Data privacy. It’s just starting to become a hot button topic, and expect it to get bigger. Any cloud service is harvesting you data and either selling it, analyzing it to target you with ads, or both. If you are concerned about data privacy (and you should be to at lease some degree), it should be a major consideration.

3 - Greater choice in compatible devices, with much cheaper options available. GH and Alexa have their own ecosystems that will drive you to spend more in their ecosystem. These devices are rarely cheap and many, such as cameras, require monthly subscriptions (even more $). 

Ultimately, GH and Alexa will easily be a better choice for very non-technical people, but they’ll be paying a premium for the ease - whether it’s in higher priced devices, cloud subscription fees, data, or all of the above.

If you are somewhat technical, it may be worth your time to learn how to set up and use Hassio. Yes, it has a steep learning curve.

FatRogue,"I wouldn't deny the enterprise logistical conveniences for allowing other businesses to run in conjunction with your own to maximize effectiveness - Its a joint investment and as such better outcomes for both parties with more to gain than anything to lose.  
 My concerns by principle are more around an end user/ consumer /an individual who has a simple system setup in their home for example: the best security implementation is to simply not have the possibility for it to touch the cloud/ net at all, be it a secured database or not - every single junction is a vulnerability that are periodically getting leaked in today's world. Whether it matters how much of someone's video inside their home gets leaked is a big deal - that's up to the user to decide in the end.   
 At the end of the day once private data is out in some database, it will never really go away - unlike things in the old biological world, those vulnerabilities and information to be gleaned from the data will never be deflated from could-be-attackers.   
 So the best way to prevent such an outcome for users - is to simply not allow it to touch a cloud in the first place. Big tech is getting around this by claiming that ""they arent collecting private data from onboard contacts/camera/video/microphone/internet traffic/etc"" because they are processing the data onboard and collecting the results/ processed signals instead (this isnt anything better, but remains a legal gray area where they can continue to operate.)   


 The business platforms may not get to use your private data for their goldmining machine learning algorithms for user profiling - but the user remains secured. Even Moreso, their trust that the things that arent\* happening (these technical legal gray areas of translations of terms of services / what -could- be running in the background) remain a non-issue will tend to yeild much better Quality of Life and response to product services in long term. As users begin to become more conscious of how privacy IS user end security, these highlights will only get bigger.  


 So leave cloud services for Enterprise businesses, sure -   
 But I dont need to rabit hole that anxiety (for new vulnerabilities, backdoors or who is profiling my family now, whether its a hacker, an identity thief, or a robber, even the usual 'business partner', a marketing platform, a political org, or a govt office, etc ) when I get home, myself - the only QoL improvements I could expect to yield from automated home services would be on entirely local run systems.  
 If there is anything that goes outside of a local system: the user should have direct control over and logged oversight of. System/Component updates, I/O commands to push pull specified data to specified locales, etc etc.  


 We have to get used to the idea that data doesnt degrade like memories, attention, or life. Just because certain data is not inherently useful for vulnerabilities today doesnt mean it cant be used to profile or find new vulnerabilities in 10-20 years from now, without a single loss of resolution. This is a new concept of vulnerability for society, and the implications are only now beginning to catch up in the first stages.

8246962,"OP- I too have been researching this as well, and from what I can tell there's three categories of cameras. You essentially need to choose which category makes sense for you:

(1) Really Simple- These cameras are very low cost ($30-60), come from one of several Chinese manufacturers, and only play video in their manufacturers app. The Yi brand makes several very popular ones. I have concerns about the privacy (ability/reputation of the manufacturer to drop-in on your camera feed). 

(2) Premium Simple- These cameras cost more ($80-$200), come from higher-end US/European manufactures, and mostly play video in their own app (but may have integrations with other video display services). Nest and Wyze are examples. These solutions don't give you a ton of flexibility (video can only be displayed a few ways), but I have a little more faith they're not spying on me.

(3) IP Cameras- These cameras have a wide-range of costs ($50-200), and come from a wide-variety of manufacturers. Their advantage is that they support several standardized protocols for transmitting video over a local network. This gives a lot of flexibility in how the video from them can be played back, but it requires a separate software to setup playback in (for example, you may by an IP camera and then need to purchase a playback software called 'Blue Iris'). I am discerning who I purchase from again because there's still some possibility a manufacturer could be watching my camera feed.

I'd be curious if /r/homeautomation thinks I'm missing any categories or any major considerations of the three categories above.

I purchased a camera in category (1) about a year ago. It works great, but I realized that the lack of flexibility in how I watch the video from it isn't what I actually want.

FatRogue,"I'm a Uni student studying to be an EE: embedded systems &amp; Computer Vision -&gt; Systems Design guy.

 Despite the industry trends and understanding the enterprise desire to kirby-suck up data like a fat kid with Cool-Whip - I chose long ago (old job in Military Intelligence) to be a user privacy advocate. 

 While, for me by principle- I take these choices to lengths of paranoia, and as a consumer see absolutely no options on the market which only means that as a customer -nobody- gets my business. If consumers had even a basic understanding of security impacts to lack of privacy, they would be wary of -anything- that uses user data and touched a cloud.

&amp;#x200B;

 My opinion is that if enterprise level companies produced systems that could be trusted to transmit no user data to the cloud and operate everything internally - the consumers themselves would make the choice to put cloud based systems in the dirt (unless thats specifically what they want from their system as a feature.) 

 From the security perspective, the cloud is a critical risk introduced to the user even separate from personal data which is the current gold standard.

&amp;#x200B;

 For now, as I learn to create these systems, I strive to learn the best I can to deliver local and secure systems. For home projects I would consider it practice, though I do acknowledge that it would quickly feel like *work\**. So, in my impressions, what we really need are simple to implement and understand open source software to manage UI interactions to systems otherwise put together or interfaced by the users themselves.

 If we make it easy to implement and understand and mitigate the *work* part of an internal system control - then why go the route of implementing tiers of vulnerability in using the cloud?",1554826493,ekh8k6i,t3_baxosv,t1_ekgmih6,/r/homeautomation/comments/baxosv/iris_closes_shop_wink_is_on_the_edge_artik/ekh8k6i/,1,homeautomation
chiisana,"HomeKit leads with privacy and fastest response time.

Typical Alexa and Google integration works like this:

1.	User makes the request
2.	Voice assistant sends command to vendor 
3.	Vendor sends command to device

HomeKit protocol uses mostly local network broadcasts instead of going through the cloud. So in HomeKit work flow:

1.	User makes request
2.	Voice assistant broadcasts command locally directly to devices

This means with a real HomeKit certified device, your interaction doesn't have to leave your network (doesn't have to doesn't necessarily mean it won't, unfortunately... Vendor could still send a call back to the vendor cloud after the fact). It also means when you're setting state for multiple devices, they can change state quicker at the same time. In turn, this creates a much faster response time.

adidasnmotion,"Depends on what is important to you. Amazon has most number of compatible smart devices. Google has the second most number of devices but is quickly closing in. Apple comes in at a distant third but you’ll find at least one if not more different products for each smart home device sector and that number is growing over time. Both Amazon and Google seem to be ahead of Apple when it comes to the number of things you can ask their respective assistant to do but Apple is quickly closing the gap.

Having said that, I prefer Apple’s HomeKit for a couple of reasons. 1st, it’s designed with security and privacy in mind. To be HomeKit compatible vendors have to adhere to strict security requirements. That strictness is part of the reason why it’s taken longer for device vendors to make their products compatible with Apple HomeKit. By privacy I mean that I don’t have to worry about Apple selling my data. 

Secondly, it’s designed from the get go to work if your Internet connection goes down. This allows people who worry about security and privacy to block Internet access on their HomeKit devices and control everything through Apple’s Home app or Siri.

With regard to your specific questions, however...

&gt;  I keep seeing reviews on YouTube say the Dot is better but Reddit says the Google mini has better voice recognition and better answers.

The Google Home/Home Mini does tend to work better, in my experience.  It recognizes phrases better, tends to offer more functionality, and I have the impression (not verified) that it works with more smart device brands. It also seems to have better answers to questions that involve searching the web.  I haven't explored an Alexa device's routines (pre-programmed, multi-command macros), but Google has some pretty solid capabilities there.

&gt; At the moment I'm looking for something to play music hands free and to take down lists and reminders that will alert me on my phone.

Google works very well for the former.  I haven't tested the latter.

&gt; I've found the Google assistant reminder hasn't been super reliable or the notification didn't show up until I tried to open my phone again when I wanted it to vibrate to alert me. I think that's the biggest reason I haven't gotten the mini. I'm concerned about the notifications and reminders. I don't know if it will work different once you use the app.

Bear in mind that the assistant on the phone and the assistant on a home device tend to work somewhat differently.  Each has things the other lacks.  Also, these capabilities change as Google updates them.  That said, if you're using an Android device, Google Home devices tend to be a little more tightly integrated in the overall ecosystem.  Amazon's Alexa-based devices seem a little out of touch by comparison.  Again, this is personal opinion.

It might be worth ordering both and trying them out.  They aren't very expensive.  Personally, I stick with the Google Home and have left the Dot unplugged due to its always-on nature.  It's quite possible that Google's devices are just as nefarious, but I've seen numerous negative reports about Amazon's devices and none about Google's devices in that regard, so take that as you will.",1554632980,ekb0nr6,t3_bae140,t3_bae140,/r/homeautomation/comments/bae140/not_sure_if_i_should_do_the_google_mini_or_echo/ekb0nr6/,1,homeautomation

Vlad_the_Homeowner,"There are options out there for people that are concerned with privacy or who want to keep everything local.  But that  requires significantly more knowledge and setup, and conflicts with your desire to not have a hub.  Amazon and Google have very user friendly options - it's what they do - allowing people to avoid getting hubs and having things more or less 'plug n play'.   And of course, there are significantly fewer options for peripherals and what you can do with home automation, if you stick to just Google or Amazon.  Then there are the privacy concerns for those that are worried about it.  I won't get into that, but just a point to think about - your phone is far more power than most hubs, and possesses all the ability to spy on you that home automation does, arguably far more.

I think [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is the current champion when it comes to local run home automation.  It seems to have a pretty large following for support and development.  Like I said, it requires more upfront to get it up and running, but once you do it is far more capable than most other options out there.

Pros:
&gt; Links everything together

&gt; Different devices can be used and linked together - MQTT, WiFi, Cloud (Tuya, Phillips), Zwave, etc.
&gt; Accessible all in one place - can also be set up to be accessed outside the home
&gt;(With extra tinkering and flashing chip) Allows you to remove almost any WiFi devices from the cloud and use MQTT instead - and block their internet access, improving security and privacy 
&gt;Hass.io has loads of add-ons that will take care of most of your needs (such as MQTT Broker, Node-Red, etc)
&gt; There are many tutorials on YouTube if you ever get stuck 
&gt; Can control many devices, from lights to media players
&gt; Can integrate with Alexa, Google and Homekit (by proxy making any devices smart assistant compatible that weren't already)
&gt; Some devices are discovered automatically and dont need any setup

Cons:
&gt; More hands on to set up
&gt; Requires maintenance every once in a while
&gt; Requires you to have a raspberry pi/means to run it (I have mine piggybacking on a virtual machine on my Plex server)
&gt; If you ever planned to sell the house, the next owner would probably not know how to use or maintain it.

But there are lots of other portal options, especially in the higher $200-300 range. There is just something about being able to cast music throughout your house -- makes house cleaning better. 

Bonus Tip: With this setup, you can also say ""Hey Google, broadcast 'Time for school, we're leaving in five minutes.'""

&amp;#x200B;

With music and lighting working, you can then experiment with Google Routines, which is kinda their answer to IFTTT. They're still early stage and clumsy, though. I do love being able to say ""Hey Google, set the house to away mode."" But things only work about 85% right.

You might also consider a Chromecast-enabled TV. My Vizio doesn't ""listen"" for my voice, but it responds to commands I make from Google Home, and even turn it on and off.  ""Hey Google, play videos of Puppies on the Living Room TV"". This also allows you to ""cast"" video or screens from Android phones and laptops, as well as videos (but not screens) from iPads and iPhones. In theory, you can do this with just about any TV by plugging a Chromecast Video into the back, but it needs a special later version of HDMI to support turning the TV on and stuff.

Although, good guides do exist and kudos to the authors for that. 

You’re absolutely right. But, here’s my thinking on why I personally don’t insist on staying local:
1. Cost (debatable)
2. My internet in the last 3 years has been down less than 2 times.
3. Servers haven’t been down more than 2-3 times a year, though maybe I don’t notice. 

When I run the stats calc, the chances of a breakin during those times is super low. However, and maybe what drives home your opinion, is that I do fear the future robber who does manipulate the internet (cuts a cable) or something like that. And that’s possible. My network is secure to the standard individual, but maybe not someone with know-how.

Dean_Roddey,"It's already easy, just add money. It's like asking, will it ever be easy for average person to own a car or a house. Well, yeh, you spend a bunch of money. The other option is build it yourself. No one questions that with houses or cars but somehow it seems alien to a lot of folks when it comes to automation. 

And, when you consider that any automation solution, to be really useful, has to be highly customized, now consider the cost of a customized car or customized house. Why is it going to be any different for automation?

Automation isn't a product, it's a system. And it's a system that, in almost any practical incarnation ( insiliconation?) has to deal with lots of other systems and products that it wasn't designed specifically to deal with. That also is a huge complication that doesn't even come into play with houses and cars. Well they deal with it a little bit, but it's not fundamental to what they do, while it is for an automation system. 

Having said that, some home builders will come up with a fairly generic solution that they will put into homes. It won't be automation the way most of us around here think about it, but it'll be better probably than the average person's DIY effort (which is close to non-existent.)

At some point, considerably down the line, we will reach a point where artificial intelligence makes it possible to just throw a quality set of hardware into place and the user can just tell the system want it wants by way of discussion, and the AI can know if things are not working and ask for help and all that.

Of course at that point, we will have lost ALL privacy because that will be the ultimate data gathering inside agent for the companies who sell those systems. It will have to know who everyone is, recognize their voices and faces, etc...

I'm looking in to getting smart blinds for one window in particular because I control it around 10 times a day.  Sometimes for light control, sometimes I need privacy, sometimes I want my dog to have her view etc.... Some of this can be completely controlled by time of day and week.  But a vocal command to do this when I want, or used as a Stringify macro etc... is definitely going to make it ""worth it"" for me.

1. Contextual lighting. Makeup requires different light to the overhead, but you only want it on when you're doing makeup.

2. Turn on the extractor if someone sits on the bog, and run it for 2 minutes after they get off. Can totally do this without a hub, too, of course.

3. While we're at it, let's do a healthy blast of airfreshener when someone has been on the bog and leaves the room. God damn.

4. Play music depending on who is in the shower and what time of day it is.

5. Put a sensor across the bog roll so the system knows when the roll is low. Never be caught short again.

6. Got a fancy shmancy bidet seat? Pre-heat the water in it based on analysis of usage patterns. You may not be aware of this, but a lot of people are kinda consistent about when they shit. A month's worth of usage data could identify that pattern nicely.

7. Turn on the towel rail warmer when someone actually uses the shower. (how fancy are you people?)

8. Trigger external automations based on usage: Bob takes a shower in the morning and then has a cup of coffee. He's in the shower now. Let's fire up that coffee machine in the kitchen.

9. Too steamy in here? Extractors on.

1) Automation. This is in its infancy.  As time passes, homes and devices will become much more fluid with human interaction. I would also anticipate that many chores / errands will be automated - cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, etc. 
2) Customization. Different solutions can be derived for different user experiences. Searching this sub and similar subs it's clear that use cases vary significantly.

Literally every purchase has to be deeply investigated for compatibility with other stuff you have (mostly hubs).

LiveMike78,"You might want to consider what the definition of a Smart Home is. We are living in an age where many people confuse a Smart Home with an automated home, and even a non-automated home.

Take Alexa for example, often cited as a key device for the Smart Home. However, what is Smart about turning on a light by saying ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen light""? That's not even automation - it's just a sophisticated manual switch. I think there are a lot of ""smart"" devices that aren't actually smart. Certainly not by themselves.

Another example, Philips Hue light with a motion sensor. We've got away from a manual switch to an automated switch. But, it's still no smarter than a motion triggered light that we've had available to us for many years.

&amp;#x200B;

What is truly smart?

What gets closer to a ""smart"" home is when you start linking services together, make use of AI and start to make use of the cloud. For example, it's a cold day but a smart thermostat knows nobody is home. It's stay turned off, but now a mobile device has informed the thermostat that someone is travelling home. Looking at the traffic data, the current location and speed of travel an estimation of when someone will be home can be made. The thermostat knows how long it will take to heat the home based on the current conditions inside the house, outside the house and based previous times taken to heat the home. The thermostat fires up the heating at the right time so that energy isn't wasted heating an empty home, but when someone returns home the house is at a comfortable temperature.

We're on a journey that will take us to a truly smart home like that example. For some examples I what I think of as truly smart home possibilities:

* Roomba's that clean the floor when it's dirty, not just on a scheduled routine - even to the point where its AI knows the difference between dirt on the floor rather than anything else like the kids Lego. If I drop flour on the kitchen floor the Roomba detects this and cleans it up for me.
* Alarm clocks that wake us early or late depending on the traffic forecast based on where that first meeting of the day is on our schedule. This combined with our current stage of the sleep cycle so as to wake us when it will least disrupt us.
* Lights that adjust based on the activity you're currently doing - bright lights when you're doing needlework, or reading. Dim lights when you're watching a movie. Less dim lights when you're watching the news. No light when the ambient light is sufficient.
* Heating that only comes on when it is needed - for example, if I am asleep in bed and it gets cold but the weather forecast and my schedule tells the heating that by the time I'm likely to get out of bed the house will have naturally heated then don't heat the home.

These all require AI that needs more than simply onboard processing - and they need connectivity to ""big data"" and other services outside of the particular domain the products will be in.

What are the challenges beyond these complex technical ones?

* Privacy/Security/Reliability: I believe that cloud services are critical, and all those come into question.
* Complexity: I have Samsung SmartThings with a diverse range of sensors that often need custom integration. I have Alexa, Nest, Philips Hue, Logitech Harmony. I use cloud services such as IFTTT and Stringify. I even use industrial software that's not available to the consumer market because I work for the company that makes it. All these have to work together, and there is nobody other than me in my family who could (or would want) to understand it all. Smart devices need to work together without extensive knowledge how they work together.

* Cloud based

* No built in rules engine

* No built in web page building, and what exists 3rd party is VERY limited compared to other systems, especially what I moved to.

* The online community at the time was all ""well if a smartApp doesn't do what you want, just code it yourself in Groovy.""

* The SmartApp model is ridiculous--a crutch thrown at the system after the bone-headed choice to not have a built in rules engine. Result is you need multiple SmartApps to do what you want with any given device. I also once was advised by ST support to delete a device and re-add it to get it working. Well guess what, it was part of FOURTEEN different SmartApps. That took a damn long time, and then I had to add it back!

* No real logging. You have to turn logging on BEFORE you want to see the log. So dumb. When I notice a problem I want to go see what caused it, not go turn on the log so I can see next time.

* No Desktop client

* ST forum users back in the day were all ""just code it yourself"" every time there was a question about how to do something no SmartApp allowed.

* No integration with Mac OS, which allows tremendous superpowers.

* Clunky 3rd party iTunes support

* But #1: **reliability was truly terrible.** Unbelievably bad. I used ST during what was apparently the year of hell, where multiple developers for the platform all pulled their plugins in protest. (I hear this is better now but don't care, I'm done with ST.) I recognized some of these failings while I was using it obviously.

* notifications: I want my home to hint to me if I need an umbrella or a jacket. I don't have a screen or smart mirror yet, but I have been playing with changing the color of a few HUE bulbs near the door in the morning to hint if it's going to rain that day. 

* smart wake up: I have one light fade in with the sunrise in my bedroom. Then when my alarm goes off, the rest of the lights along my morning routine turn on (bedroom, hallway, kitchen). 

* Smart nightlights: if I walk into the Hall at night only turn on the lights to their dimmest setting and in red so I don't ruin my night vision.

The potential of hacking just seems too high given all of the shenanigans the Chinese manufacturers are known to have built into the firmware of so many network cameras from the start.

I.e., any off the shelf solution has good reason for privacy concern.  


That said, a dedicated system to record is nice, but for just one or two cameras with alerting etc., you may be better off with Ring or some similar variant. You can get some great cameras with minimal management headaches.

Either you run everything internally without sending data to any third party provider. Or you carefully read the privacy policies/EULAs for each service you want to use. There are trustworthy third parties, and ultimately it’s up to you as to how private your data is.

If you don’t feel comfortable with your connected devices sending data to other parties who either poorly secure it, outright sell it, or otherwise will surrender it under certain conditions you probably won’t want to use any provider services. Most companies are going to tick one of those boxes.

Almost every company on the market using cloud services to process your data and not charging a monthly fee(and even some they do charge fees) have clauses in their ToS that allow them to sell your data, keep it indefinitely, etc. 

They do this for 2 main reasons. 1 is for internal training. If they can use your data to improve their models and increase accuracy, it's a win win. Until that data leaks out, or gets mishandled. The other is to sell your data to make a profit, and to pay for their cloud infrastructure / engineers.

Nixellion,"I suppose everyone has their own experience. I'm glad it works for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

To make my contribution to this thread at least somewhat useful - here are some of the reasons I did not use Windows for my server. Everyone can decide whether to listen to these reasons or not. Whether they influence you or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Windows updates. I could not tame them. They always happen at the worst possible times for me, no matter how much I delay them. Setting connection as Metered also did not work for me as it blocks some other features as well.
* Price. I would have to pay 80-100$ for the system. I already own about 3 copies of windows, and I lost one copy due to significant hardware upgrade. I really can't just throw money away like that.
* Performance degradation. For me Windows performance does degrade over time, and it's often easier to just reinstall it than try cleaning it's registry, etc. Also it degrades without reboots. I never **had** to reboot linux server unless I did it for my own purposes.
* How much HDD space it occupies. Minimum installation was about 20GB. Often it could be up to 30, fresh install. Linux is what, 4-6GB? And could be even less depending on distro.
* RAM usage. Minimum RAM usage I got with Windows 10 is 1.4GB on idle. Usually it's 2-3GB. Idle linux distros use less than 500MB. 
* Most server technologies are oriented on Linux nowadays. Makes it much easier to operate.
* SSH is great for headless server operation. For GUI I can use Webmin or docker. Or start xserver and use SSH XForward if I absolutely want that desktop gui.
* Technologies like snapRAID, mergerFS. I liked them more than their Windows counterparts. 
* Privacy. Not that I bother much but Windows 10 telemetry can't be stopped 100%. 
* And just the fact that almost all production servers and PCs that require high stability and performance in the world are using Linux\\Unix systems. It should say something on it's own.

&amp;#x200B;

At first it was really time consuming and frustrating making my first move towards linux. But now that I learned it and got familiar with it it's not harder than it would be with Windows. I even tried to use Linux as my daily driver. Which partially worked, but I just have too much software that depends on Windows. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, these are just my 2c.

Ideally you pick equipment that doesn’t use the “cloud” or the internet to work. Of course a lot of stuff being sold today does require an internet connection to work unfortunately. 

My desire to stay away from cloud based solutions is three fold. First is the loss of functionality in the event that you loose connection to the internet. This might be due to a hardware failure like you describe, but it could also be due to your ISP failing somehow. 

Second is for privacy reasons. I don’t want all that “home automation” data going out and being collected. It also opens up ways for people to hack your house and devices without being physically present on your network. It’s just too risky IMHO. 

Third is that you are held captive to the service provider. They can change their pricing at anytime and you have little recourse unless you want to replace your equipment. Plus, they could go out of business or change directions with their business model and simple turn off the cloud functionality rendering your equipment useless. 

None of these scenarios are far fetched. I’d rather buy equipment that doesn’t rely on an internet service than to expose myself to these issues. ",1547754580,eeaomp9,t3_agzfni,t3_agzfni,/r/homeautomation/comments/agzfni/if_you_are_going_to_the_trouble_of_setting_up_a/eeaomp9/,1,homeautomation

TheBazlow,"So here are three that I've been looking at for a while. I'll be honest after that whole fiasco earlier last year with [Yale locks going offline](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/12/glitch-yales-smart-security-system-sees-brits-locked-homes/) I was spooked away from their offerings but maybe they've got their house in order now.

First up is [Honeywell Evohome Security](https://getconnected.honeywellhome.com/en/evohome-security). This one has been tempting me ever since I got the evohome heating controls installed. Not the prettiest but very versatile and robust. It hooks up to the internet and sends emails and optionally text messages when it goes off (but not push notifications curiously). In terms of accessories it wins hands down, you have carbon monoxide sensors, smoke alarms, glass break sensors, motion sensors, door sensors, inside alarm, outside alarm, key fob controls, RFID keys, motion sensor camera and an app. I don't think it talks to Alexa or Google and the camera quality is a joke so if you have your own camera setup, this is not going to replace that but if you want a reliable alarm system isolated from the rest of your smart tech, this might work for you.

Next is [ycam](https://www.y-cam.com) now their offering includes cameras that you can actually see a person's face with. They offer a subscription service that adds some flourish to their offering of motion sensors, door sensors, alarms and cameras. Of the three this one I think is the cheapest and it has its own app and integrates with Alexa but I don't think it does Google. It doesn't have a keypad or the likes just your phone and a remote to control it. 

Lastly is [Somfy](https://protect.somfy.co.uk/uk/) now they make smart blinds and are anything but cheap and their security system is also... Not cheap but it still is an interesting product. They have a simple siren and motion sensor camera AIO device that can act as a security hub or you can buy the parts separately. Motion sensors, door sensors, inside/outside alarms, inside/outside cameras and a key fob for control. The cameras have an interesting quirk too, a privacy shutter so you know it's not looking. But all this is not cheap and the subscription isn't either. However because it's Somfy and they're been about for a while, if you want integration this one is it. With a TaHoma hub you can link up smart products like hue bulbs to the alarm, you can make routines with the alarms and other devices so if you like to dabble, this one works quite well. It also works with Google and Alexa because it's all about that integration.

Other honourable mentions include [ezviz A1 alarm](https://m.ezvizlife.com/uk/product/alarm-starter-kit/910) with motion sensors you need to recharge every three months and [ERA Smart alarm system](https://www.erahomesecurity.com/smart-security/security-and-alert-systems/era-smart-home-alarms/era-invincible-smart-home-alarm-system/?)

redroguetech,"&gt; Where do I start?

See [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/9xfccf/mega_getting_started_thread/).

&gt;I did some reading and the cheapest option as it looks is Xiaomi sensors with their multifunctional gateway. 

Don't need the Xiaomi gateway.

&gt;There is also Samsung smarthtings hub.

Rather than the SmartThings, I'd suggest Hubitat Elevation, though it doesn't have an app for remote access (see below).

edit: SmartThings relies on cloud processing. /edit

&gt;How interchangeable are sensors that use common protocols like zigbee or z-wave? Can I use sensor from Xiaomi with lets say Samsung Hub or vice versa?

Z-Wave and Zigbee are sort of interchangeable, if the automation hub handles both (like SmartThings). There's a couple differences, the biggest being entirely different mesh networks. The other is that Z-Wave devices have to be included into a network. Adds a bit more security, but makes it a bit more difficult to add and remove stuff (and by extension, Z-Wave has a central node/controller).

&gt;Ideally, I prefer a DIY approach (due to privacy), I know programming and enjoy this kinds of stuff. But a made universal hub at a decent price is also a viable option.

See Hubitat.

&gt;My ideas it go get RPi with touch screen. But what software do I use? I found only Home assistant. 

The other option is OpenHAB. See [here](https://smarthome.university/your-smart-home-platform-home-assistant-vs-openhab/).

&gt;Can this be linked to different sensors from Xiaomi, Samsung and others (as long as they use standard protocols like zigbee/z-wave/wifi/bluetooth)?

Yes. All the options presented - ST, HE, HASS and OpenHAB - support a large number of devices. No system supports *everything*, so always check before buying something. I know for a fact ST and HE support the SmartThings and Xiaomi sensors, and have been told HASS does. (I'm less familiar with OpenHAB, but... it's just a Google search.)

&gt;Will I be able to access the Hub from outside world (lets say my smart phone or outside my local network)? How do I secure it?

ST, HASS, and OpenHAB have apps (though I've only used ST). With HE, you can put in a VPN and/or reverse proxy to gain remote access. Some routers have VPN support built in. I had to use a RPi, and it was harder than I expected, but still just following directions (assuming you find the *right* directions the first time). The reverse proxy I've not tried yet; I've been told it requires a SSL certificate to be properly secure but does not need a VPN client on the remote device.",1545925454,ecnwi2p,t3_a9yqxa,t3_a9yqxa,/r/homeautomation/comments/a9yqxa/so_i_want_an_automated_home_where_do_i_start/ecnwi2p/,2,homeautomation

VMU_kiss,"Man I have many ideas I wish would come to fruition.  
  
1) Kitchen dispensers - Think about it specific storage for all your spices and dry goods like pasta and flour.  
  
The reason this would be great is it could add when you need more to the shopping list. Be integrated to your recipe so it dispenses exact amount you need for a recipe you are following. and it knows what you have on hand so asking what to cook and it knows what your got on hand and you add in any veggies or meat and it gives you a recipe would be awesome.  
  
 
2) Active IR sensors - I've been looking into this and working out the best way to use these but the cool thing is that this could be in the bathroom and know your in the shower through the glass and know when you aren't and turn off the lights.  
 
It's like a lo-fi version of a body heat camera it would be able to know if your pet is inside the laundry room or outside or if you are in the lounge room asleep on the couch plus it picks up signatures of heat so if you leave the room but someone else is still there it will stay on because it can see heat.  
  
It's a better system than camera's so no privacy is invaded plus it's seen on an 8x8 grid so outlines of people won't be a thing either so it works well. The downside is i don't think battery power is a thing.   
  
3) Stick on button pushers - A thing i've been looking at as well basically it's a small sticker you place over a button like on the dishwasher and you can push the button like normal but the sticker can push the button as well so you can start the dishwasher remotely.

Dean_Roddey,"Probably the biggest single change, and the biggest single danger, will be voice recognition. Not speech recognition, which is coming along fairly well, but recognizing very accurately who is speaking. That might be combined also with facial recognition.

When the automation system knows who it is dealing with, then a whole slew of possibilities become available. It can react based on who the user is, limit options based on who the user is, you can do restricted operations like disarm the security system safely through voice operations, it can know you are in a particular area and do things based on that, it can tailor spoken responses to the known technical level of the speaker.

But, and it's a big fat but, that also opens up a whole new realm of privacy invasion. If that recognition system ends up in the cloud, and likely it will given the economic realities, then it's just got Skynet written all over it.

attunezero,"It is for automation and connecting devices. It is very similar to the Samsung SmartThings hub except that everything runs locally where with samsung every single thing that happens in your home goes to their cloud for no reason. Hubitat controls zigbee, zwave, and IP (wifi, ethernet) devices. It supports basically everything that ST supports and can even share user written ST code with little change to add functionality. I believe it was created by some people who were big ST community contributors but became frustrated with SmartThings glacial progress, bugs, unreliability, and privacy invading cloud.

With ST if your internet has a hiccup nothing in your home works. Or if they have a cloud outage (which has been frequent with them). Or if there are bugs in their service (also frequent with them). Or if they decide to update your hub at an inconvenient time. Or if they decide to release new hardware and stop supporting your hub (happened to v1 users). Or if they just decide to shut it down you lose everything. Plus nobody knows what they do with all the data from your hub.

Paradisel,"  

I disagree with a number of the posts here and I’ll try to explain why.  


First thing you need to do is choose voice recognition. Without it, all you have is an app controlled house. Nice but overall not that convenient . Google or Alexa. I chose alexa because a year and half ago when I started playing with this stuff, I did some research and Amazon respected my privacy more than google did. I can’t find the link anymore, but Amazon had an area where they listed the government requests for data, and their responses. Google refused to divulge that information, and as we know google has a history of handing our privacy over to the nsa.  


Now I’m not a bomb maker. I don’t cook meth. I don’t plot to over throw the post office. However if my girlfriend and I are laying in bed discussing our fantasies, I don’t want some dweeb listening in, pulling his pud in some cubicle in a government building.  


So I went with Amazon.  
 

Next is what are you looking to accomplish? If it’s just to look cool, then just go out and buy a bunch of stuff and install it. If you’re interested in functionality, which since you’re asking, is probably your goal. Then you want to plan out what you need. Unfortunately to do so, you really need to get a few items and implement them, and with their use you’ll figure out what goes best where.

Besides guaranteeing some level of interoperability with the HomeKit framework, it really just means that a third party set of eyes (which if you use iCloud at all you trust in some way) has vetted the hardware and associated applications and reviewed and obtained pledges regarding backend data collection, storage and sharing policies, processes and flows and not found any issues. 

For a device to be HomeKit compatible, the vendor must submit the hardware and software to Apple to pass MFI certification.  This includes backend compliance to personal data collection storage and sharing guidelines.

While some manufacturers may fail to meet these standards and not be able to ever be HomeKit compatible,  the security and privacy standards can be matched or exceeded by manufacturers who shun Apple certification and the costs involved with the program.  However, in the home automation field, one weak device, app or backend may compromise the entire home.

I have two networks at my house -- and the two do not overlap. It's not possible to jump from the guest network to the private network.

This alleviated *my* concerns with this device (and all IoT devices, really), but those were more security focused than privacy.

My floor plans are already public through my county's office, and my home is not a super secure secret building. I don't care if the floor map is uploaded or not, so I don't share those privacy concerns.

z7xl,"IOT products are affordable simply because they are always online and need a cloud service to operate from. The companies DON'T make money from the initial sale of their product, they make it from selling data gathered over long periods of time, from their product which is now placed within your home network. The products not only report on usage data of their primary function, e.g. lights, temperature, security etc... but also gather data on all other connected devices within your home as well e.g. the number and type of connected phones, tablets, game consoles, laptops, desktops, printers and other iot devices and measuring your usage on them as well. This is why IOT is so inexpensive - privacy does not exist, security is compromised and products are easily hacked.

If these issues are important to you then there are two directions to go in

1) is to install a high end proprietry home automation system such as Control4, Vantage, Crestron etc... These can pretty much only be installed during new home builds, but for an existing home Crestron Pyng is a very nice option  when looking to retrofit instead of a mass produced IOT product. These products do cost a lot more than IOT devices and do often require a certified installer and electrician, but provide much greater privacy and security.

2) is to start retrofitting your home to a building protocol such as KNX. KNX is a standardized protocol supported by hundreds of manufacturers with thousands of KNX certified products that all talk to each other across the KNX cabled bus. This KNX bus becomes the backbone of your control and automation system and is not connected to the internet. The devices you choose to add to the KNX bus may have internet connectivity but the majority of them don't, allowing you to design and build a private and secure home automation network to your liking. Again, it is more expensive than IOT devices, but in some cases may be cheaper than some of the high end propietry automation solutions. It does require a certified installer and electrician though.

Of the two, I personally recommend looking at KNX. There is a growing KNX group on reddit to help you in your investigations further.  ",1542988593,eaaxuos,t3_9zndje,t3_9zndje,/r/homeautomation/comments/9zndje/security_in_home_automation/eaaxuos/,3,homeautomation

redroguetech,"&gt; Perhaps I’m overly worried, here, but I would also determine up front how secure you want your automation system to be. This might significantly impact your decisions.

I agree that's important, and I'll work on adding that in, or at least mentally drafting something and seeing if I think it fits. However, I don't think it's an early design choice, except maybe to avoid WiFi products. The best ways to secure HA gear is traditional ways, such as closing ports, using separate WiFi network (or router), using a VPN, etc. I can't say security has influenced me in any way on which products to use, because... well, you should assume any and every retail device is not secure.

Not accusing you of astroturfing or anything. Just saying privacy fearmongering has become a marketing tactic, just like populism in politics. Many people blindly exclaim ""muh privacy"" without putting much thought into it.

&gt;But I’m pretty sure all these big tech companies (maybe apple excluded) are collecting data that they supposedly don’t.

Not sure what else to tell you. Perhaps this network analysis would convince you that Echo devices aren't recording all the time:
https://www.iot-tests.org/2017/06/careless-whisper-does-amazon-echo-send-data-in-silent-mode/

The Echo does have some storage. So Amazon must be storing surveillance data in there, right?? Except that experts have been hacking Echo devices since gen 1, including checking the storage. No one has ever found anything malicious in there, as far as I know. If you're interested in what some security experts find inside the Echo (including the flashs memory), here's one presentation: https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-summit/archives/file/summit-archive-1498230402.pdf

I had a much more flexible setup  under Google Voice and Tasker and took a bit of a step down in language capabilities when moving to alexa, but the microphones, ease of setting up new devices and more made the downgrade almost worth it. I lost the ability to string commands together, as you see in the demo, when I moved to Alexa. Tasker's Google Voice plugin was genius but at the end of the day not having to shout everything has improved the GF Acceptance Factor. 

My setup - 

* Pi3 - running Ha-bridge and my broker
* LightwaveRF throughout the house
* Hue, Lifx, homebrew lighting with a mix of REST and MQTT control
* * Sonos Control through SonosAPI originally, but now with the Alexa skill.
* Denon AV control through hardcoding it into my broker
* TV control through IR and Broadlink RM Pro
* Obvious things like timed light settings linked to sunset. 
* Morning routines
* Making tea routine
* Arriving home, leaving 
* Adding Home Assistant gave me easy access to sensors, these :
* Linked to Fridge and RGB Strips + ESP8266. Flashes the LEDs when the fridge or freezer door is open.
* Magnetic Sensor on the front door and more RGB lights across the front porch that normally play patterns, but turn white when the door is opened.
* Basic tasks and scenes Dinner, movie, jukebox
* This was all linked to voice prompts playing over Sonos, but I removed it, a beep is enough.
* EZVIZ, Nest, D-Link, Somfy Privacy cameras, Somfy Alarm.
* Alarm sense keyfob and disarms automatically
* Had an idea to get LightwaveRF 433Mhz remote and mood controllers to integrate with home assistant, which I use to link to devices and scenes. Nice looking, Cheap and easy to mount ""switches"" and a bit of Home Assistant automation and they work a treat. Very cool.

[deleted],"Okey, I have been researching all your advice. Um this is very long. You don´t need to read all this. 

Tl:dr Probably going for Apple homekit, Ikea smart bulbs + wall plug, a door lock, a thermometer and maybe smart blinds or curtains. 
Controlling siri with Sonos One, Apple TV, iPad and Mac. Have an issue with spotify, but hopefully 
Also a question. I can control lights, thermometer and door with android right? They have their own app? Do not need voice control. 

I don´t have Amazon where I live, and I don´t use anything from Amazon. I´m not sure if it´s the right fit for me. 
I do have a Samsung phone. Smartthings could work fine. I will continue to use Android until iPhone catches up to the rest of the phones out there. My issues are mainly the screen, lightning port and possibility for 3rd party apps. Can probably live without third party apps when I get my Plex server up and running. Hopefully apple can get rid of the notch next year. Along with the usb-c. 
Only lightning port I have is for the apple tv remote. Not a big deal as I charge it maybe two times a year. 
Everything else I have is Apple except for an old windows pc. Having an iPhone that will work so well with my other devices is something I really want. 

So... I have 2 iPads (one old), an Apple Tv and a Mac. Will probably go for an iPhone in the future. I also care a lot about privacy. Homekit just seems like the best fit for me. As with Sonos, I really like that their devices last a long time. Apple still supports the iPhone 6 right? I mean wow. 

Bulbs... 
Ikea trådfri. Works with Homekit, google, alexa... Does not have colored bulbs yet. I don´t think colored bulbs are worth $50. I did see in another thread that bulbs sold on Aliexpress are great. Are they?
Anyways with Ikea I can setup timer. But increase brightness slowly for 30minutes before I have to wake up. Can that be done?
All lights turn off when I/the last person leave the house. Can probably be done with a door lock? It was listed as a feature somewhere. 

Trådfri adaptor also released by Ikea last month. So cheap. Can be used with homekit. I can use this for my lamps where I can´t change the bulb easily. Think christmas lights.

Smart lock...
These are a bit expensive. Well around the same price as a Sonos One. Can unlock automaticly when I get home. Remote unlock. Give access to guests. And I really hate carrying a key. 
I read that they also can tell all my lights to turn off when I leave the home. Thats great. 

Thermometer...
There are so many I think would work. Not sure what to pick yet. I have to wait for when I actually move. What if I get heat pump/air conditioning...
With the Ikea Trådfri adapter I can plug in broilers, radiators and more. 
The thermometer then controls the trådfri adapter and turns the heating on and off. 
So do you think the smart lock can tell my thermometer to turn off all the heating when I leave? (Like with Tado). They can turn off the lights so why not? 

Smart Speakers...
Sonos One works great. Bedroom, bathroom and maybe kitchen. Also for alarm in the bedroom. As these soon support siri, airplay 2, google assistant and Alexa, I will not buy other speakers. I will live in an apartment for at least 6 years, so no need for larger devices outside of living room(TV). And not enough rooms to need something like a Google mini for assistant in every room. Well... The Sonos one is overkill in the bathroom. If they only released another small device.  Maybe for small rooms and height speaker support for TV (3D sound, DTS-X and ATMOS).
For the kitchen a smart screen would be nice though. Like the one Google released a few weeks ago.
Spotify and siri do have issues. I see the shortcuts already starts to help. Hopefully more functional soon!
I do want Sonos to upgrade the Playbar for Airplay 2. Or downgrade to the Beam.. It´s annoying not having airplay here without the apple tv. Apple tv also needed for Siri. Another reason for upgraded Playbar is 3D sound. Will need HDMI input so the Playbar can´t just get a software update. A new playbar + some kind of height speakers are needed. Hopefully Play:1s could be used for surround and left and right front speakers. 


I´m not sure I need more than this. I do want maybe a few colored light sources. If I wanted philips hue instead of the Ikea stuff it would get a lot more expensive. Hopefully Ikea releases some soon.
Smart Blinds or Smart curtains could be nice. Depending on the apartment and time of year, using the sun to wake me up is an option when I have smart blinds/curtains. 
Smart plug for tea in the morning maybe. Would have to remember to fill with water. 

So about what I can control with my Android phone. 
And what will work if Wi-Fi wouldn´t be available for a few days? 
Ikea bulbs and the wall adapter can be controlled with ikea app on both ios and android. Also have remotes for offline use. 
Sonos for playing music would work offline when connecting a computer to one device. Wish they had Aux. Well I will have to look more into that actually. 
Apple TV offline. Can also connect a pc connected to my NAS drive for endless movies and series watching. 
Smart lock also can be unlocked and locked while offline. 
Blinds and curtains can still be moved. 

Reminders will be annoying. If I tell siri to set reminders, I will not them on my phone. I guess maybe Siri can make lists in Todoist and Google tasks with shortcuts. Have to look more into the new shortcuts feature...


I will probably run into some issues since it´s apple. Hopefully I can avoid most of them. 

Thanks again for help! If you see any problems with what I am planning, please tell me. Very new to all of this. 
Ikea bulbs controller looks kinda annoying to use. Wall switches, if they even work with ikea. Are they hard to install? Even without changing anything in the place I rent?

What will it all cost me? Ikea bulbs and smart adapters maybe $150. Smart lock $200. Thermometer $100-$200. Smart blinds or curtains, I have seen prices less than $100. Only need that in the bedroom. Upgrade Playbar. Can sell the one I have for $200 less than a new one. Might drop when new device is announced. So a new device might cost me $200-$300 assuming price stays the same. 
$800-$950. Glad I will not buy all of this at the same time. 

Buying name brands. Homekit will get updates. Ikea bulbs system will get updates. How long do these things last? 
Can also keep in mind homekit when buying appliances. Oven to turn on before I get home for quick pizza or something like that. Other uses? Dishwasher. Why? Washing machine and dryer. Why? Fridge, I can´t see a reason for that to be useful. ",1541560246,e97c8uc,t3_9urnui,t3_9urnui,/r/smarthome/comments/9urnui/where_do_i_start/e97c8uc/,1,smarthome

randhindi,"**Question 1.**

Right now, Snips is not a consumer assistant. It is either integrated into consumer devices by our customers (in which case its up to them to decide what the assistant does), or it is being used by developers for their own stuff. 

We are now working on a consumer version of Snips, complete with a consumer app store, which will enable you to have a seamless experience. Privacy is of course the first benefit, but the goal is first and foremost to create a great product, with lots of great apps you can use. To put it differently, everything other assistants do will be doable with Snips, but we offer guaranteed Privacy on top :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Question 3.** 

One of the issue with existing app stores is that they have centralized reviewing processes. It effectively mean that company gets to decide who can build what, and in the process take insane fees. What we want at Snips is an app store where the developers get 100% of the value of what they create, with complete freedom on what they can build. The issue however is that you also want to guarantee high quality content, avoid malware etc.. 

By using a token, we can solve this problem by creating financial incentives for developers to only publish good apps. This idea, called a ""token-curated registry"" basically requires you to ""stake"" (i.e. lock up as a collateral) tokens to publish your app. If the community votes that you app is bad for the ecosystem, it gets rejected AND you lose the tokens you staked to publish it. In means Snips does not decide who can publish what. The community alone decides that!

I went with a HomeKit integration via Homebridge since I’m pretty much all in on Apple’s privacy policy.

I did a similar system for my dual wire furnace system in the main house (relay hat instead of ssr’s), but the LEGO case on the wall just wasn’t flying with the SO.  There is now an Ecobee3 in main house. I’m a big fan of the room sensor integration with Ecobee.


No complaints on function when it works, which is most all of the time when the cats don’t think the DHT22 is a toy. If you can 3D print a nice enclosure/cover for the DHT22 and can run low voltage lines in the wall, then this system could be a lot more slick than my solution- doubly so if you just run the Pi by the hvac equipment then use the 4/5 lead run previously for thermostat to connect the DHT22.

Herr_Gamer,"&gt; Your only secure alternative is to use only cash for purchases, which is wildly inconvenient. 

I like to use cryptocurrencies when applicable.

Browser histories are stored locally on a fully encrypted harddrive, internet sites use SSH certificates to ensure that, even if there was a man-in-the-middle-attack, the man in the middle wouldn't be able to read what you're doing, which also makes it hard for the government to understand anything you're doing. (Besides, ideally, my router wouldn't be hacked by default but rather only when I become a target, only making the information from after I became a target visible to them)

Credit scores and centralized medical records are inconvenient, but I believe these things things in particular are too convenient to miss out on. Right now, there are still very strong privacy laws on a constitutional level that ensure my medical data would, ideally, not be leaked. Of course, a third party would still be able to leak them despite these laws, and if my government turns sour they could overturn those constitutional laws.

As it stands, I'd still rather have a centralized company have some minor ownership of my data rather than a government. Because what does the government need my browser history for anyways?

The ToS conditions for violating the ToS conditions wouldn't apply, because the conditions of the ToS were violated.

_However_, many, if not most of these people, will happily continue to upload their pictures to facebook and instagram and will carry a device with them *at all times* with their entire life saved on it, with their biometrics, their current location, and all their social contacts packed neatly in between what will likely be up to two microphones and cameras.

The development of smarter AI should change that a lot. People will be able to ask for things more conversationally and perhaps without even saying a wake word like “Alexa” (though that would open up privacy concerns). Beyond that, Alexa, Google Assistant and other voice assistants could reach a point of being a lot more like Jarvis from Iron Man, letting you just chat with them.

DevestatingAttack,"If your threat model is ""can someone with unlimited time or resources get into my house under any circumstances"", then sure, yeah, bring up the chestnut of breaking in through your windows.

But broken windows leave very visible evidence that your home's integrity has been compromised, and can alert you inside the house to respond to that threat, or if you're outside of the house, to avoid the threat entirely. Breaking windows to gain entry to a house is usually only done when the goal is theft, and stolen items can be replaced, especially if you have homeowners insurance. No one who plans on lying in wait to assassinate you in your own home, or who plans on planting a surveillance device is going to do it by busting out your windows- they'd want to compromise the lock in a way that's hard to notice. And anyone who plans on coming in to kill you is going to avoid windows if possible - because it's loud, unmistakable, and neighbors notice it.

If someone busts out your windows, then they're probably thinking you're not home and are planning on stealing things. Things can be replaced, and insurance is cheap. Lives and privacy cannot be replaced. Implying that secure locks are pointless because there's always another way in ignores that other ways in are a lot more obvious to you and outsiders, which is why the other ways in are typically only utilized for certain types of threats.

The latter is built specifically so it won't start recording until after the system hears a sound matching the wake word. And it's easy to test whether the systems are capturing any audio and uploading it without your permission (by taking apart the device to investigate any on-storage memory and monitoring its network traffic). Smartphones on the other hand allow for nearly any app with the microphone permission to listen in on you. And it's more difficult to monitor the traffic. ,1536863788,e5x4r63,t3_9ezwv2,t1_e5t51i8,/r/homeautomation/comments/9ezwv2/is_it_possible_to_use_alexa_or_googles_doohicky/e5x4r63/,2,homeautomation

I'm pretty sure this is Samsung's end game here, the focus on the cloud, the basic hardware itself being dirt cheap.. They want your data.

ImBrianJ,"Yes, ""really"".

What I mean by simple machine learning is that you take some concessions - that 8% error rate.  Of course, for a simple setup, you wouldn't wire it up to call emergency services.  But for what I think many want, that 8% error rate is acceptable for most uses.  Especially if it means you can have it now and have it be applied in a simple way.

You also don't necessarily need to submit your info to the cloud since others patterns don't necessarily dictate your own.  Locally storing events and calculating probabilities locally also avoids the privacy concerns you raise.

Vlad_the_Homeowner,"&gt;People used to make your argument over tv.

That's not the same argument at all, nor is your alternative out of line with exactly what I said.  My very first sentence acknowledges the endless possibilities of a free market.  What you're referring to is a disruptive technology, an eventual outcome for most industries once they become stagnant like cable did.  I haven't had cable in years, and I only had it because it came with my internet.  But that's just it, people aren't putting the money they used to spend on cable in their savings accounts, they've moved it to their internet provider, netflix, Hulu, on-demand movies, media centers, multiple TVs, pay to play etc.  I'm not saying it's not better, just that as technology evolves most industries find ways to move your money to other areas and let you think you're paying less.

Plex is a whole different situation, and for the record I have a Plex library set up at my house as well.  But are you claiming you have 50 TB of content that is either free for distribution or you paid for?  Exactly.  People have been stealing entertainment media since the VHS and cassette tape, nothing has changed there.   But we wouldn't have Plex if it wasn't for me, my wife doesn't know how to set it up, neither do most my friends.  As I said earlier, there are home assistant options outside of the mainstream if you're willing to put in the work.  And so long as it remains technical enough to keep out the masses then you'll be able to keep stealing entertainment in private for your family.  But as soon as it becomes easy enough for the average person to do you're going to see that tech pulled away (Remember Kazaa?).

But I think you're overestimating the size (and therefore power) of the people with the technical know-how to either utilize a non-mass market (read: user friendly) option and/or to really understand and care about the information that is collected.  People are simple creatures, and seemingly getting more simple.  If you start a conversation I have no doubt most would dislike that our data is being collected and sifted through, but it doesn't seem to be stopping anyone from purchasing electronic assistants.

I've always known that Alexa records and stores my voice commands.  My wife, who I'd say is representative of the typical modern technology user had no idea and was somewhat putoff when I played back some of our recordings.  I'd prefer it didn't do that, but at the end of the day, I don't really care either.  My life isn't interesting enough that there's anything in my daily interaction with Alexa that would stick out from the billions of other piece of data it collects from anyone.

I felt the same way when I started seeing ad banners pop up on my computer for something I had searched for on my phone hours earlier.  It's an invasion of privacy, and I wish those bastards would stay out of my data, but at the end of the day do I really care if the ad banner is flying something that I had looked at on Amazon vs something I have no interest in at all?

redroguetech,"The article is literally addressing retail solutions.

When I envision a ""smart home"" solution that is 1) Approachable by the average consumer, and 2) Not professionally installed, the only thing I can think of is AI. There's too much customization involved.

However, given current technology.... Yes, there are feasible solutions for the average consumer, but they are closed systems (eg professionally installed). And yet, most things most people do are pretty similar. You leave the house, you want you shit to turn off, and you want your security system turned on. Doesn't matter whether you have kids or live in Nebraska. So, smart apps that provide a basic wizard setup for things like which motion sensors to connect with which lights, and to do what at what times, when which people are home... *hopefully* someone will make them. (Preferably, with a pretty wizard to tell people where and how to install everything.)

AI is the true solution, where - provided a sampling of user data - it figures out when you leave and arrive, and (to the degree possible) *figure out* what we want to happen. Privacy issues aside, that's still a long way off, at least as a viable off-the-shelf product.

redroguetech,"&gt;1. Professional Installation in Your Home

&gt;Installing a safe and reliable network into your home is a big deal, so choose a trusted professional who will help you in the process of transforming your house into a smart home.

Wrong! Professionals will use an established company, which would almost certainly collect usage data.

&gt; 2 A Privacy Protection Agreement

&gt;Because your smart home is going to be generating a large amount of sensitive data within its network, it’s important to ensure that that data is protected. Have your service provider sign a privacy protection agreement first thing.

Wrong! The very need for a privacy policy means they collect the data.

&gt; 3 Secure Passwords

&gt;This one might seem like a no-brainer, but a lot of people come up with passwords for sensitive accounts that are easily hacked. Since this is your home we’re talking about, a strong password is vital to the security of your network. Don’t use default passwords, your WiFi password, or that one password you’ve used for 11 other accounts. Decently long and complex is the way to go, and you’ll feel all the safer for it.

Wrong (and has nothing to do with ""privacy"")! I mean, it's a good practice, but for a locally stored password... It really doesn't matter. Intrusions would be due to either: 1) Retrieving your password from the system, 2) Hijacking your existing session, or 3) Bypassing the login entirely.

Also, it doesn't really apply to home automation in general. Even if someone hates you enough to go through the effort of brute-forcing your password, they aren't going to do it on a relatively obscure platform like Hue or Nest. And with a home automation controller, they basically can't if it's local; it'd need to be cloud based. Your Amazon or Google account.... Yea, you might want to password protect those, but not to keep someone from seeing what you tell Alexa.

&gt; 4 Protect and Update

&gt;A precautionary step you can take is to protect your home’s network with a firewall so that third parties are unable to read your data.

Mostly wrong (and has nothing to do with ""privacy""). If someone gets into ""your home's network"" through Zigbee or Z-Wave devices, then a firewall wouldn't do anything to stop it. An automation controller.... A firewall would help, by limiting ports and such, but for the most part, wouldn't do much either. The router itself would be far more vulnerable, since an automation controller wouldn't be listening for inbound traffic except through very specific addresses and ports, such as from a dashboard or through the app.

If you want security and/or privacy, use local processing, and avoid big names like Nest, Hue, Alexa/Home, etc. Pretty much anything that has a separate app.",1536238130,e5hp80i,t3_9d8w34,t3_9d8w34,/r/homeautomation/comments/9d8w34/is_your_smart_home_spying_on_you/e5hp80i/,1,homeautomation

* data privacy issues\*
* it has an unwanted ability to grab things that dangle in front of it (but handles wiring really well)

(\* From [https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/xiaomi-mi-robot-hacked/20632/](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/xiaomi-mi-robot-hacked/20632/)

The researchers also learned something disappointing about Mi Robot, however. The device collects and uploads to Xiaomi cloud a *lot* of data — several megabytes per day. Along with reasonable things such as device operation telemetry, this data includes the names and passwords of the Wi-Fi networks the device connects to, and the maps of rooms it makes with its built-in lidar sensor. Even more disturbing, this data stays in the system forever, even after a factory reset. So if someone buys a used Xiaomi vacuum cleaner on eBay and roots it, they can easily obtain all of that information. )

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I should mention what I do like about it:

*  My carpets look really clean now. The first day I got it, I ran it a few times and the dust bin filled up with dust each time but my floor had been neglected for months. It fills up less often now.
* The app integration and automation is fantastic. I set it to run each day when I am at work. The mapping and path are great too. The app also stores information about how long the components (ie brush, filters) have been used for so I will know when I should expect to replace them.
* I chose it over the more expensive Roomba 980 because the Roborock uses lasers and the Roomba uses cameras. Laser is better because it can handle darkness better and my apartment isn't that bright even in daylight and there are areas such as under the bed and couch that are really dark.",1536128261,e5f6ilj,t3_8ip23r,t1_dyuluj2,/r/homeautomation/comments/8ip23r/robot_vacuums/e5f6ilj/,1,homeautomation

Naito-,"Hello fellow ex-pebbler!

And completely reasonable to want no-cloud.  That’s what I’ve done with my home, aside from the ecobee which came with the house. 
Everything else is local-only, cameras, switches, lights, sensors.

Aside from unexpected obsolescence from cloud dependence, it’s a privacy issue.  I don’t need a bunch of companies collecting my home habits and travel habits.  They have enough of that already.

Wifi devices CAN be ok, you just have to vette them carefully.  Many of the cheap china ones will still phone home for something, even if they’re locally controllable.  I’ve blocked a bunch of those at my firewall, and use modded firmware for them whenever possible.

Zwave and zigbee are great, just be careful which hubs you get to control them.",1535204732,e4t4sc1,t3_9a2sm7,t3_9a2sm7,/r/homeautomation/comments/9a2sm7/am_i_being_unreasonableparanoid_for_trying_to/e4t4sc1/,1,homeautomation
Kv603,"I'm not aware of any security cameras which offer particularly good direct integration with just one smart home solution.   Some might have ""disable motion detection"" or ""enable privacy mode (you hope)"" integrations, many do IFTTT, a few higher end ones can work with multiple products by sending/receiving REST calls, but that's about it.   I'd recommend just picking cameras which claim ""ONVIF Profile S"" conformance.

As far as smoke/CO and [thermostats](https://www.zwaveproducts.com/) go, I like the Z-wave solutions, in part because Z-Wave isn't inherently cloud-tethered and there are multiple choices of hub, many device vendors adhering to the standard.     For example, there are several makers of Z-Wave thermostats, if you don't like your first choice, you'd replace only the thermostat, keep your hub and app.

Compare that to  Nest or Ring, where you're locked in with a single vendor's cloud solution.

OldeMan,"I have three of the MySmartBlinds “kits” — adding “automated tilt” to my standard 2” horizontal blinds.  They cost $130 for the basic kit (plus, of course, the cost of whatever blinds you’ll be adding the kit to).  In my case, existing blinds, so free.

Frankly, the conversion was really easy:  Pull the old blinds down.  Pull the tilt mechanism.  Slide the metal bar out enough to feed through the kit’s motor, add the battery and switch.  Done.  It takes about 20 minutes to get it down, modify, back up, and connect to app.

For mine, I just wanted them to open at sunrise and close at sunset (privacy at night).  They’re great for this.  They also have the ability to sense the room’s temperature and open/close appropriately... but I don’t use this feature.

The app is OK... it connects to the blinds via Bluetooth, unless you also buy a hub to access them remotely.  Since mine are on a simple schedule, I’ve not felt pressured to buy the hub.  The BT connectivity has been fine for me.

Add on:  You can buy a power kit... so it’s permanently wired.  Or a solar strip, so they stay charged up from ambient light. The charging port is standard micro-USB... so you don’t need to buy their solution if you don’t want to.  You can also buy a hub to connect all of them (if you have more than one) to Alexa or Google (no HomeKit ... yet?) ... as well as give them the ability to be controlled when away from home.  I’ve not bought any of these yet.  I’m pretty sure I’ll eventually get the hub... I’m stalling to see if they add HomeKit.

I charge mine about once every three months.  They *DO* act a little squirrely when the battery gets low (open/close off-schedule).  Charging is simple, I sit a battery on top of the curtain and plug into the micro-USB port... and remove some hours later.",1533948120,e3zfedc,t3_96c4s6,t3_96c4s6,/r/homeautomation/comments/96c4s6/smart_blinds/e3zfedc/,1,homeautomation

If you're comfortable coding, I'd set up AppDaemon on top of home assistant and really get fancy with the automations. 

2) If all you want to do is voice control and all your appliances / devices are to be google assistant or Alexa supported, I wouldn't bother with a server. Your google home will work well enough for simple spoken commands.

wahoorider,"I wouldn't call it a mistake. SmartThings will work with HA just fine, using an MQTT bridge. I have it configured and it works just fine. Granted, it takes a little time to get it configured. If I were buying new I probably would recommend buying a USB stick for the HA on the Pi. But you can definitely get what you have working, so don't fret too much!

Let's take a quick glance at the pro's and cons (obviously this is not an all-inclusive list)


SmartThings
Pros

* Easy to set up and get started
* Supports ZWave and ZigBee devices
* Access and control your devices from anywhere easily

Cons

* Limited advanced automation
* For those concerned about privacy: it's hosted on the internet.

HomeAssistant
Pros

* Extremely configurable
* Advanced automations
* Hosted locally in your house
* Works with just about everything

Cons

* Requires another hub or USB stick to work
* External access requires configuring of a VPN or exposing HA directly to the internet
* Can be overwhelming for some


So it really comes down to what you are comfortable with and what your goals are. There's no reason you can't use what you've already purchased. If your goal is to use HomeAsisstant for everything, it may be a bit cheaper (and more reliable) to return the SmartThings hub and buy a USB stick for HA. This will take longer to set up and really get started, but if that is your end goal there's no need for the SmartThings hub. If you want to be able to control your home while you're away, SmartThings hub will make that very easy, while HomeAssistant will require some networking to accomplish.

diybrad,"The zigbee2mqtt project uses a ""zigbee shepherd"" to make all these different manufacturers work together on one zigbee network. Then it just gets published and controlled via MQTT, which any controller software will work with. So really it doesn't matter what protocol the bulbs are using to pair/update, zigbee2mqtt juggles the connections over the zigbee radio stick. I'm not a dev but that's my understanding of it.

diybrad,"It's very simple - home assistant with zwave and zigbee sticks. Almost every other device or sensor is run through MQTT using an open source project.


Openmqttgateway for Bluetooth, iBeacons, MiFlora plants (15x of those with 5 sensors each.. 75 sensors just on my house plants!), RF, and IR devices. DOZENS of sonoff-tasmota devices. Everything from lighting to garden irrigation pumps to my toaster to my coffee mug warmer are on esp8266 devices because why not, and all of them have additional sensors attached. All wall switches, doors, windows, and even my fridge door are on z-wave. Z-wave thermostats. Every room has multiple motion sensors. Most of my RGB bulbs are through the esp8266milight project but I have a few hue and tradfri lights that I use with zigbee2mqtt. I have a bunch of Xiaomi zigbee stuff - buttons, leak and smoke sensors, few other things that are also run through zigbee2mqtt. Music is handled by volumio clients and networked Onkyo receivers. Cameras are all generic MJPEG streamers that are consolidated with MotionEye. TVs all have Rasplex clients for a local Plex server (has an OTA DVR so even the media isn't internet dependent...). Security alarm was custom built with the Hass components. All of this centralized in home assistant. 



I guess I'm working on adding SMS for notifications so that that isn't internet dependent, openmqttgatewy supports that.  I have so many cameras I started setting up facial recognition and other AI vision stuff (locally, using machinebox/facebox). 


I only have 2 devices that required apps to set up - Wemo Coffeemaker and a Xiaomi vacuum. But once set up, app deleted and they are on a locked down VLAN... Hass controls them locally via WiFi.


I mean sure I pull the dark sky forecast and public transit times and stuff like that from the internet, but nothing important depends on that stuff. None of my home automation traffic leaves my home, period, and I have every device controlled somehow. If you value your privacy (and aren't afraid of simple soldering) there is always a local option!

Dain42,"&gt; For fuck's sake. I don't disbelieve that it's happening

You sure put a lot of time and effort into nit-picking and explaining away everything for someone who believes this is happening. Honestly, what this looks like to me is that you saw an article that framed some potential negatives of a thing you like and you decided to read it in a defensive crouch, rather than giving it a fair shake. This is evident in the way you deal with the contents and nit pick at stupid things like this: 

&gt; AFAIK you don't use an amazon echo to monitor your home.

If you bothered to actually read what you quoted, they listed a class of device, gave a couple examples for clarity, then listed a couple ways that these types of devices (smart home devices, generally) are touted in advertisements. It's clearly not an attempt to say, ""These two specific devices could be used for all of these things."" I would call your reading hyper-literalistic, but the literal text demands no such interpretation.

It's deeply disappointing seeing this style of ""argument"" taking hold in more and more places, where a tiny ""own"" on a decontextualized or willfully misinterpreted snippet of a original text or work is seen as a valid form of discussion or refutation, rather than addressing the piece as a whole.

&gt; but I hate stories that attribute something which can have multiple causes to one cause that the author has their sights.

How do *you* know this is happening? It seems pretty rich for you to make this kind of assumption after going on and on and on for paragraphs bemoaning how someone else is making assumptions.

Most articles that get written have a lot of background to them that doesn't make it into the article. It can't, or every article would be too long to read, and the daily newspaper would be the size of a set of encyclopedias. Sometimes you just have to rely on the track record of a newspaper, its journalists, and its editors. I mean, that's how being a news consumer works: a lot of it is sorting out credible and noncredible sources. A lot of this is built on reputation and trust, and the *New York Times* is one of the outlets that has built up the most trust and an excellent reputation for accurate reporting.

It's a more than fair assumption, reading this story and looking at the context, instead of treating each individual story as if it's an isolated anecdote taking place in a mythical blank-slate world, that many of these stories are framed by a context of other kinds of domestic abuse, either physical or emotional. **People don't get to the point of calling an abuse hotline or uprooting their entire life and going to a domestic abuse shelter because their AC unit turned off one time or because the doorbell rings once in a while and nobody's there. And that's where** ***all*** **of these stories are coming from in the article.** Sure, *outside* of that context, all these various explanations might make sense, but *in* that context, an abusive partner is far and away the most likely explanation.

Additionally, it's not at all surprising that we aren't treated to a lot of details and personal information about individual cases. Given the subject matter, such information could potentially put sources at risk of heightened abuse or reprisal, or the details might be things that are not shareable due to privacy rules at shelters or call centers, even if general patterns and the outlines of some incidents can be shared. In fact, if you'd bothered to read the article carefully, rather than just skimming for ""debunk points"", you'd have seen this:

&gt; The people who spoke to The Times about being harassed through smart home gadgetry were all women, many from wealthy enclaves where this type of technology has taken off. They declined to publicly use their names, citing safety and because some were in the process of leaving their abusers. Their stories were corroborated by domestic violence workers and lawyers who handled their cases.

It's honestly not a stretch at all to see how this technology could be used in this way, and it's a distressing new front for abuse that people should be aware of. Plenty of people have no idea about the ways that lots of non-technology (appliances, lights, fans, etc.) can be ""technologized"" these days. This might all be old hat for people in this sub, but many (maybe most) of the people I know in real life haven't even heard of Hue bulbs and have no real idea that things like WiFi plugs exist.

While I'm all for celebrating the ways technology can make life easier, save energy, and make life better, we absolutely cannot ignore the ways that the same technologies can be used to hurt people. Even if there's nothing to be done, technologically, on the vendor's end, it's important to talk about and be aware of this front for abuse, and it's probably important for vendors to be aware of this so they can develop protocols and strategies to help people who are the victims of this kind of abuse.

It's also really important for family members and social workers to be aware of this new potential front for abuse, so that they don't disbelieve people when they describe this kind of behavior, especially if it comes in the context of other warning signs for abuse.",1529831535,e17bwgm,t3_8tdoc7,t1_e16u2av,/r/homeautomation/comments/8tdoc7/thermostats_locks_and_lights_digital_tools_of/e17bwgm/,6,homeautomation
Threezeley,"So I was living in a similar apartment for several years. Windows faced the entrance of building so you couldn't open them; cieling didn't have a light; kitchen was sort of part of the living room. 

I did three things:
1. I got an ambient floor lamp and put it on a regular smart plug. Pretty sure I got one of those Ikea rice paper lamps with 3 bulbs. It did a decent job providing 60% of the light.
2. Low tech solution: go to the hardware store and get the adhesives they sell for your windows for privacy. They have a pattern on them that makes it difficult to see through, which means you can open your blinds, get light, and have privacy.
3. I added LED strips in my kitchen (above AND under the top cabinets) to add more light to that side of the room.

Magnus919,"HomeKit is, to me, a mixed bag.

I don't like using Siri to control things. Not even a little. It's not a sophisticated AI compared to, say, Alexa. You've got to have at least one Home Hub, not cheap, like an AppleTV or HomePod. The workflows that you can build with HomeKit are also not very sophisticated.

That said, Apple's business model inherently puts more value on security and privacy than, say, Amazon or Google.

HomeKit also has very limited vendor support today. And there are vendors that are ""HomeKit Compatible"", but you get a limited subset of your devices capabilities within HomeKit. 

So you might end up using Stringify, IFTTT, etc. to make it all work. At which point... you're farming out your home automation to a ""Free"" service who's business model is unclear. Where is IFTTT getting $? Stringify? What are you giving away to them to make this service ""free""?

And does your house become lobotomized if your internet service goes down?

Or what happens if/when Stringify or IFTTT go dark like so many other Silicon Valley startups with a nonsensical/opaque business model? Again, does this lobotomize your house?

redroguetech,"(All this is directed towards OP.)

&gt; It's simple and easy to use. Setup &amp; adding additional devices is very simple.

In my experience, ST hasn't been ""simple and easy"". There's a half dozen different ways to do anything basic, but often seems like there's only one way to do something complex. If you can figure out what that one way is, it's not terribly difficult, but does require finding and loading third-party drivers and apps. It's powerful, but if you need to read multiple guides to use it, it's not ""simple and easy"".

&gt;Setting up rooms, scenes &amp; routines are all very simple. Again however, I am not doing anything too elaborate. Simple routines such as when I leave do X, and when I return do Y. When it's dusk do X, when it is dawn do Y.

To do more complex things, you'd need to abandon the built in routines and third party apps (such as WebCoRe for logic/rules engine). See above. Following a guide, it's... not ""easy"" but not terribly difficult.

&gt;Android UI is simple (Be careful, there are two versions of Samsung SmartThings for Android). The Android App to my knowledge does not provide a lot of details on errors the system / device is reporting, if something is ran locally, or the ability to add custom apps / configurations.

There's ""SmartThings Classic"", which had always been just ""SmartThings"". And there's ""SmartThings (Connect)"", which used to be just ""Connect"". As least as of a couple months ago, Connect is garbage. Samsung is merging the two together, and claims that their spawn will be better than both. I can't foresee the future, but there's been numerous indications in the past that it won't happen like that. Exhibit A.... Samsung's continued insistence on marketing both as just ""SmartThings"", requiring people to read the fine print that with their own products they usually mean ""Connect""... despite admitting they have no clue when the new merged app will be finished.

Aside from potential long term outcome of all that (which is a risk with any product), the main issue with SmartThings is most is processed in the cloud. Aside from security or privacy concerns, that means a minimum 1 second delay... assuming there's internet. (As per my other post, I've switched to Hubitat. It's not any easier. It lacks an app for off-site control, but has local processing. The app is slated for release ""as soon as possible"", or something vague like that.)",1529429045,e0xu61r,t3_8s8z23,t1_e0xsmjb,/r/homeautomation/comments/8s8z23/new_to_automation_and_want_to_start_right/e0xu61r/,2,homeautomation
xdq,"Please bear in mind this is based on my experience:

PC Software:
I wasn't a fan of zoneminder when I tried it a couple of years ago but don't remember why.  
I found raspberry pi (v1, model b) too slow for motion detection and streaming. 
I used iSpy (ispyconnect.com) for a couple of years but CPU usage increased too much once I added a few more cameras. 
After that I used Sighthound (Sighthound.com) which was fantastic for motion detection. It uses computer vision to determine to downtown between humans and other stuff. CPU usage wasn't bad but the jump in price between 2 camera and unlimited cameras was too much for me. I ran it with 2 cameras and left the low quality ones on iSpy. 
I currently use BlueIris (BlueIrissoftware.com) which had good cpu usage with 10 cameras. The licence covers a major version of updates and is reasonably priced.

---------------
Mobile software:. 
tinyCam monitor Pro (free version available too). 
I use this as a primary means of viewing my cameras remotely. You can use it as a server for recording cameras (Pro version iirc) and there is a cloud option which costs a monthly fee per camera. 
The dev, Alexey, is active on Google+ (https://plus.google.com/communities/115794095184548411935) and quickly responds to issues. 

BlueIris app. 
Costs money in addition to the pc software but it works well. It's fast and stable allowing you to interact with the pc software.

--------------

Cameras:. 
I haven't personally used Nest, Ring etc  but they seem fine if you just want to set &amp; forget, and don't mind paying the monthly fees. 

Arlo sounds nice as you can store video locally but you're still stuck in their ecosystem and have a limited choice of cameras. Battery powered cameras will likely need charging more frequently than advertised if they're in high traffic areas. (Lots of motion alerts causing them to wake up frequently.) 

Raspberry pi camera:. 
You'd have to choose between day/night vision and the setup will cost more than a Wyze cam.

Cheapo cameras:. 
Some cheap cameras such as Sricam and others I've tried only allowed you to use their app which was clunky and caused me some privacy concerns.

More expensive (for home user) cameras:.
I've got a couple each of Hikvision and Dahua cameras. They have in-depth settings that weren't available on some cheaper cameras I tried. For example being able to switch to night mode (ircut filter) but leave the ir illumination off.
High MP (megapixel) cameras in general use more storage, more bandwidth and more cpu. They'll give better quality during the day but will be poorer in low light conditions.
Given two almost identical cameras which differ only in number of pixels, the lower MP I've will give better night results.

Middle cameras:.
I've got a middle of the road foscam which is great as it's USB powered and WiFi so I can stick it on a battery and user it as a baby monitor or to watch from inside my car when I leave the windows open on a hot day.

I've got some Annke cube cameras which are rebranded Hikvisions and have pir for motion alerts.

------------

As others have mentioned there is a standard, ONVIF that allows software to view the camera with minimal fuss. Another thing to look out for is that the camera allows you to its 'stream'. 
This stream may be rtsp, mpg, h264, jpg but if a camera allows you access it means that you don't need to use the manufacture's app.


If you run your own server, using the software mentioned above for example, then you'll be able to access remotely after setting up port forwarding. Mine is just a standard Windows pc with a couple of big hard drives and a backup drive. 
Videos are recorded 24x7 with motion alerts flagged and backed up onto the external drive. 
Motion in key areas also triggers an email to be sent with a clip and stills to a gmail account set up for this single purpose. 
Every so often I just deleted all the mail but it would take months to fill the 5GB free storage with 10 second clips.

The advantage of a custom setup is that you can pick and choose camera brands for specific purposes. In my case I have a good 2MP night vision camera watching my car and front door, a cheapo camera in my kitchen, the portable foscam watching my son and a couple of the Hikvision 4MP bullets dotted around externally.

Typed on mobile so please excuse spelling errors or the occasional incorrect you're/your.

Edit:. 
You'll generally need a higher focal length than to think you need. Ie more zoomed in, narrower field of view. 
Covering a large area is great for general monitoring but if something happens you'll not be able to make out the perpetrator's details.
DORI means detect, observe, recognise, identify. You'll see these on some camera spec sheets.

redroguetech,"&gt; I don't really like Alexa or Google Home or whatever. 

If the issue is aesthetics, rather than function, I believe it's possible to load them to custom hardware. Alexa source code is available, as is the Assistant SDK. However, you'd have your work cut out for you with getting device drivers to interface. It'd be far easier to use a stock Dot or Mini.

&gt;*I want it to be one system. as you will read i want it to control many things that require their own system and i prefer to combine them all into one system instead of buying lot's of computers. If it's not possible, fine, but i really want one computer to control everything.

I'd recommend SmartThings (ST) or Hubitat Elevation (HE). SmartThings has more supported devices and somewhat easier to set up because it's been around a few years. Hubitat has local processing, and is rapidly catching up.

&gt;*I want J.A.R.V.I.S to have good voice recognition &amp; answering skills, mainly because English isn't my main language and I have a terrible accent I want the system to understand. *The other possibility for the previous one is to just make it speak my language.

Google Home has the best voice recognition, with Alexa close behind. (In my experience, Alexa ""hears"" better, so it may perform better for you.)

&gt; *I want it to have at least basic conversational skills.

The closest thing would be Google, with it's ability to answer actual questions. However, there may be Alexa Skills (or Google Recipes) for the ""girlfriend experience"".

&gt; *I want it to be able to control things *....Or basically do whatever Alexa and Google Home can do. 

See above... ST or HE.

&gt;*I want it to know how to make a schedule for itself and for me, for example- at 7am every day turn on my lights, wake me up, put the weather on the control screen, have the news turned on the tv, make me coffee in my automatic coffee machine ...

It can't know what your schedule is. What you're dreaming of is 10 years away, at a minimum, and even then would be incredibly invasive (since it would need connect to the cloud to compare against everyone else). However, using ST or HE (with WebCoRe) you can program in complex rules with numerous triggers, like ""If after 9 pm on a weekday, and the tv turns off, and the bathroom light turns on then off, then lock the doors and turn on the bedroom light ."" However, it requires a lot of supporting sensors and devices, a lot of work to set it up, and will never be 99% reliable on not doing something you don't want (or failing to do something you do want).

&gt;The Control Screen- I take a one sided mirror thin enough so the touch screen behind it could be seen and touchable. and that's like the main screen for J.A.R.V.I.S web clients should go there (let's say I ask jarvis to open google or something) apps should go there (weather, emails, calendar etc...) the main control panel is there (to change different settings, see whats on security camera A, add things to different schedules manually etc...)

A Fire 7 tablet with SmartTiles or ActionTiles connected to ST or HE powering WebCoRe pistons.

&gt;-TV Screen alpha- the main TV of the house, it should host netflix, kodi or any other app a smart tv can run with access to cable tv. consoles and emulators are connected to this system. I want J.A.R.V.I.S to be able to control it (switch channels, consoles, apps...)

This is trickier to have what I'd guess what you want, since it would need to know *what* you are watching. However, to have the tv controllable and act as a basic ""sensor"" (see above, with ""if tv turns off"") can be done with a Harmony IR Blaster (or like device) connected to ST or HE with WebCoRe handling the rules.

&gt;Camera system- this is probably the most difficult thing here.. it should be able to recognize other people through cameras and talk to them as their own person (i dont want it to call everyone Daniel) this system should also notify me of any person who wants to come in the house and if the system meets someone new it will ask me if i know him, let me name him and create another profile for this person. then JARVIS needs to learn as much as it should about that person so he could communicate with him personally and such.. this system should also be responsible for home security.

I have no experience with security system stuff. However, from what I've read, it's generally better to stick with an independent ""security system"" that interfaces with ST or HE. You don't want to depend on ""home automation"" for home security.

&gt;-watch &amp; phone- a remote version of J.A.R.V.I.S responsible for remote controlling my home and to answer basic questions. it should connect to the main database in case i need to save files away from the server.

Not sure what you mean. Google Home can answer basic questions, but so far as I know, there's no current solution for answering questions regarding the state of your home. With a basic text-to-speech app, that should be fairly easy to put together, but it's easier just to look in an app to see device status. Most security systems will have some option for cloud storage/backup of security footage.

&gt;-boring smart home stuff- let J.A.R.V.I.S just basically control all the normal smart home devices. (lights,temperature,smart kitchen items etc........)

See above regarding true automation. It can be done and even occasionally is done, but requires a large amount of customization. It's not true AI.

Everything you describe is ""possible"". But it'd require true AI. You would need to have a system that ""watches"" you for a week or two, and could then interpolate which actions predict others...  That in turn would require cross-comparing - at an absolute minimum - thousands of people and millions of events. 

Not only would it be slurping up every most intimate and minute action we take in the privacy of our own home being compiled into a database, it still wouldn't be enough. It would have no way to know which actions are causal and which are coincidental. I can't think of any examples, but much of what we do is to allow other things. That is, those could be ""automated"" out of our lives, and we'd be glad to be done with them. However, AI wouldn't be able to tell the things happen *because of* what we enjoy, from the things *are required to allow* what we enjoy. If Action A always precedes Action B, is it that we want A, but have to ""clean up"" afterwards...? Or is it that we must ""prepare"" before we can do B?

Also, it would need to know what actions should occur when we *are not home*. For instance, when I leave, I lock my doors. If I realize I left my phone, and I unlock the door and get it... The ""system"" could (hypothetically) learn to lock the door when I leave, and learn to unlock it when I want back in.... It could even learn to lock the door and then unlock it if I left my phone. But it could never ""learn"" to just wait a minute to lock the door. And, perhaps more importantly, it could never learn to tell me that I'm forgetting my phone. I would need to, in some way, tell it that I don't ""want"" to go back for my phone, rather that I want my phone.

So.... Not to be a smartass, but to get *everything* you want, get a doctorate in AI, with a focus on personal automation. Or just wait ten to twenty years. You **can** get pieces. You could - with a huge amount of time and money - create a system that would appear to other people as if it were. If you can manage to homebrew a true AI personal assistant.... Sell it.

sidoh,"My guess is that both of the following are true:

* You're vastly overestimating the technical competence of most people who create content.
* You're underestimating how difficult it is to be GDPR\-compliant for content monetized with advertisements.  I realize this is a can of worms, but hopefully we can agree that the Internet can't exist in its current form without ads.

If we feel strongly about protecting *personal data* in the context of online advertisements, I think we should regulate companies involved with showing the ads, not individuals or companies providing content.  Because GDPR is what it is, people creating content are shouldering the responsibility.

Sidebar: I think that most companies involved with ads take privacy more seriously than most folks would expect.  Google, for example, has had GDPR\-like access to one's one personal data for many years. \(Of course I would agree that Facebook does not fall into this category\).

A few things on masking IPs:

* It's useful to have full IP addresses for a variety of pretty obvious reasons \(most of them security related\).
* I feel pretty strongly that IP addresses are not *personal data*.  The only information which is even slightly personal that IPs reveal to an entity running a service is regional location, and masking the last octet doesn't even come close to removing this ability.  Most IPs belong to blocks larger than a /24.
* If IP addresses reveal more detailed information, it is because the ISP which provisioned them is supplying  information we *should* consider sensitive \(namely: \[timestamp, ip\] \-\&gt; subscriber mappings\).  I'm sure that we'd agree that this behavior should be regulated.

I think what I'm getting at with IPs is:

* IPs shouldn't be considered sensitive sensitive, and definitely shouldn't be put in the same bucket as a person's physical address.
* I agree that dealing with IPs in a GDPR\-compliant way is not technically challenging for anyone that's worth their salt, but it also makes useful things harder, and it almost never provides any benefits from a privacy perspective.",1527453663,dzoalfn,t3_8m3yy6,t1_dzo60z0,/r/homeautomation/comments/8m3yy6/let_this_be_a_lesson_after_gdpr_some_cloudbased/dzoalfn/,1,homeautomation

TheNthMan,"I don't have the Yilights, but I have used some Xiaomi products in the past.  By default their apps ask for way too much access (and a lot of other apps from other companies based in the US and EU are also guilty of this!), but you can deny most of their requests and still use their apps and hardware.  Based on what I do know of the Xiaomi / Yi lights:

First, for their apps to work, the lights and app have to register to a server.  They did not have a server in the EU until earlier this year (last month).  Before then I think the EU users could choose either a server in Singapore, the US or Mainland China (I doubt many people chose the Mainland China option if they were not a Mainland China user).  There is no way for users to automatically migrate to the EU server, they have to have manually select the EU server in the app (and they also have to have a recent version of the app). GDPR restricts the transfer of data outside the EU without informed consent/opt out/legitimate reason and sufficient privacy controls where the data is transferred.  If you are not up to date and moved to the EU server, then they are blocking service unless you agree to allow the data to be transferred out of the EU to whatever server you are on.

What now it takes the NSA and dark size budgets to accomplish, and which at least has some sort of reasonable oversight placed on it, all cynicism aside, will become doable by large companies and then by medium sized companies, often quite out of view of any regulation, because so much of is voluntarily agreed to by the people being spied on.

jocosian,"Those answers give you lots of options.

High level points:

* Wired is better than wireless if you can do it. More reliable and less taxing on your network.
* If you do go wired, go PoE
* If you run local-only cameras, try to section them off from the Internet by using a separate network 

As /u/Ironzey mentioned, BlueIris + some rebranded Hikvision (Check SlickDeals or Costco for LaView or Swann) is going to the highest quality and most flexible. In the long term it will also probably be the cheapest, but there are extra costs to consider. If you go this route:

* I would personally skip the hardware DVR. BlueIris is a better solution all around. Almost all of the hardware DVRs have junky interfaces and offer terrible mobile apps, plus they have fewer features/tweaks for motion detection and the like. There are lots of bundles out there with DVR+cams, but I'd either find one without the DVR, or more likely resell the DVR. The bundles are often cheaper than just buying the cameras alone (and the DVR is ""free"").
* The BlueIris mobile app is pretty decent. It's very functional, but ugly and clunky.
* BlueIris is $60, plus $10 for the mobile app. They're one time fees, and honestly, that's dirt cheap for the features you get.
* You'll need a Windows machine to run BlueIris, and that machine needs to run all the time. You'll also probably want at least one decent sized (2TB+) hard drive in there. Factor that cost in if you don't already have such a machine.
* It's highly likely (and suggested) that your cameras use PoE. You'll need a PoE switch to power them, or PoE injectors ($10/ea)
* I would strongly suggest running a separate network for your cameras and BlueIris, then using a VPN to access it from the outside. This can get complicated quickly and may require a bit of extra hardware.
* There are alternatives to BlueIris such as Shinobi or ZoneMinder, but none of them hold a candle to BlueIris. I haven't used Windows in years, but I'm now running a Windows 10 VM just for BlueIris. I tried the other two options and it's totally worth it.
* If you want to try before you buy, BlueIris has a 15-day free trial, and you can use pretty much any IP camera. If you don't have an IP camera to test with, you can use a phone or tablet and download an app that turns it into an IP camera for about $1.
* I swear I'm not at all affiliated with BlueIris, but after trying lots of other options, I appreciate its completeness and stability.

If all that sounds like too much, I have a family member with a Nest system and I will say that their app is excellent, the video quality is decent, and it's mostly no-fuss. The downsides:

* The fees add up ($50/yr 1st cam + $30/yr each additional). Without that the motion detection is finicky and you don't get video history (or it's very short; can't remember)
* The cameras aren't cheap ($200/ea)
* You're sending all your video to Google (could be a privacy concern)
* Their cams are only 1080p (2K) while most the Hikvisions these days are 3K or 4K. 1080p may be just fine for your use case however.
* Their cams are WiFi only. If you're running a lot of cams this can potentially slow down your LAN and WAN (it's cloud based...) connections. It can also be spotty if your WiFi connection is weak at the extremes (like outside) your house. Running ethernet is a royal pain, but worth it for security cams IMO.
* They integrate with IFTTT for home automation (so you can do something when there's motion basically). It's decent, but won't be as flexible or responsive as MQTT from BlueIris.

The middle ground here is a UniFi system. It'll be a bit more expensive than the BlueIris option and likely about the same as Nest (depends on number of cameras and length of time; price it out). I will say that *I have not used the UniFi* system at all. As I mentioned elsewhere their networking equipment is the absolute best, but reviews seem middling on their camera solutions.

The upsides here:

* Local solution, so no WAN bandwidth issues, and no privacy issues (Same as BlueIris solution)
* PoE, so you're running a cable, but it's only one, and the connection is reliable. Plus it doesn't bog down your WiFi. (Same as BlueIris solution)
* No need to run your own server. You'll buy/run Ubiquiti's [NVR](https://store.ubnt.com/products/unifi-video-nvr) instead.
* You *can* run your own server if you want. They make their NVR software available to run separately if you need more power or don't want to pay for their appliance.
* Their software is generally excellent so I would expect the mobile app to be at least decent.

The UniFi downsides:

* Relatively expensive. ~$120/cam + $365 for NVR (optional, see above)
* You'll still need a PoE switch (~$1-200) or PoE injectors ($10/cam)
* Not compatible with third party cameras. This is annoying if, say, you want to add in something like a baby monitor that they don't support. (Same as Nest; BlueIris is very flexible)
* Everything (cam/NVR) looks like it's 1080p, and I'm not sure you could upgrade without buying a new NVR. (Same as Nest; Lower than BlueIris)
* The NVR hardware has limited CPU power. It says it'll support up to 20 cams, but you'd want more than 2TB at that point. You can run your own hardware if needed.
* You would still ideally block the UniFi system off from having Internet access (VPN accessible only). That said, I trust Ubiquiti not to phone home a lot more than I do the Chinese cameras.",1526437681,dz1w4ge,t3_8jmfej,t1_dz1q22s,/r/smarthome/comments/8jmfej/what_to_look_for_in_smart_home_cameras/dz1w4ge/,3,smarthome

On the wider scale. People are shitting bricks over gun control eroding constitutional rights  (I'm not taking either side here) and yet people INVITE their right to privacy and illegal search and seizure to be forfeited and then just laugh it off! 

I know it makes me sound like a crazy person. But this shit isn't OK. And it's a terrible attitude to have. Things are bad enough with social media ( yes even reddit I get it) why invite even more eyes and ears into your home?

If you truly have nothing to hide, then prove it. Otherwise I hope you get the (admittedly extreme case) point. 

30 years ago, nobody would invite ""big brother"" into the home. And now we're just laughing at it. 

I like technology and I like home automation, but these kinds of gross transgressions should be taken very seriously. Even if the skill wasn't published it shows it can still be done.

teabag-u,"&gt; The new Iota hub requires wifi and has no cell backup. The gateway does have a cellular connection but still requires ethernet constantly. Not to sound stupid, but if the ethernet is pulled, does the cell backup take over?

The new IOTA hub is WIFI and has Cellular Backup (4G) to be exact...and yes cellular takes over. 

&gt; Are you concerned about their direction given that the most recent product is less secure (wifi only) than their previous options...does it seem like they're going for an audience that cares less about security and just wants something very basic?

It isn't wifi only it has 4G backup as well. WIFI was a requested feature by users to give flexibility in its location. We believe they are going after the condo/apartment market with IOTA. 

&gt; What happens if someone just smashes the gateway? With SS there's some protection if the keypad or main hub is smashed, not sure whether Abode offers something similar.

What kind of protection are you talking about? They can be connected to central monitoring. If someone smashes the hub then it will trigger a police call. 

&gt; Do you have a video doorbell/outdoor camera that works with Abode?

I use the Nest Hello. Abode integrates with Nest Cameras. SS announced a camera but so far its vaporware. 

&gt; It seems like Abode customers are a little restless/cranky these days since the company hasn't done much new. Is it really just that they have such a superior system, or is this at all a concern? I don't want to invest in this and then have to put in another system in a year b/c they went under due to dissatisfied customers...

Abode just announced a major stakeholder infused them with cash. We all rejoiced...Expect Abode to grow quickly in the next year....and as an X SS customer, I can say unequivocally it is superior. Also, SS just released a new security system and didn't tell their existing customers they were doing it. To top it off their old devices don't work with the new. Thanks SS!!! The V1 Abode devices will all work Natively w/Iota and Abode will give a discount to all existing customers to upgrade hubs. 

 
&gt; Any concerns about privacy with the Abode indoor camera? I know the Simplicam has a physical privacy shutter to optionally prevent recording while you're home, does Abode have anything similar? 

I cannot comment. I use Nest 


&gt; I have z-wave devices, but none are listed as compatible with Abode...this means i have to go through Home Assistant with either system, so is somewhat of an equalizer on the home automation front. 

Did you look at the WIKI on REDDIT? Some devices are compatible but not officially. For example, I use the CREE smartbulbs and they work flawlessly. Even the dimming capability. 
 
&gt; And I guess to the other side, what do you consider the weak points of SS, automation aside (I know they had a big security flaw and were ugly as sin, but that seems fixed in the new hardware)

Read my comment about the new Security System above. Any company that will release new hardware that isn't backward capable is out for a money grab w/old customers. Abode was founded by an X ADT exec who wanted an affordable, upgradeable, and user- friendly experience. This is hands down exactly that.

unitedhen,"Sorry for delayed replay--life stuff and work. Hope you were able to find something that worked for you.

I'm honestly not familiar with an NVR--had to google what it stood for--""network video recorder"". 

I guess the server that runs my Home Assistant instance technically qualifies as an ""NVR""? It's just a computer I built a couple years ago to run my Plex Media server. All I run on it is Ubuntu 16.04 and a Docker service. It was a budget rig--I found an[ i5-4440 refurbished](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00EUUIWZ6/ref=dp_olp_all_mbc?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=all) for ~$160 on Amazon, had a spare 128gig SSD and 400 watt power supply lying around and ordered few of those 2TB Western Digital blues plus extra RAM. Total cost of the build was ~$450 but keep in mind that I decided build this rig before I even got interested in home automation. The server can handle live transcoding multiple HD streams and has about 8 TB of space, so it serves as the perfect host for my Home Assistant instance with all my cameras using `ffmpeg` behind the scenes to handle the RTSP streams.

So to have it function as an ""NVR"" I simply mounted the directory where I wanted to save all my security footage in my Docker container for Home Assistant so it has access to my 8TB of network storage on the server. I mentioned the Foscam outdoor IP cameras have an HTTP port exposed where I can query for info and send commands--I setup some simple command line sensors in Home Assistant to ping motion alarm status for the outdoor cameras, and whenever motion is detected, it triggers an automation that will tell `ffmpeg` to start recording, or capture an image via the cameras API. Both are stored on my network drive. I can even have my automation create a symlink to the last motion capture on my dashboard for home assistant. Home Assistant does a lot more than camera feeds too, since it gives me presence detection based on being connected to my home WiFi, I can automate things based on being home or not. The indoor cameras in my bedroom and office completely power off with smart plugs when I or my girlfriend are home (for privacy). The outdoor cameras will always trigger on motion detection, home or not--[so I can see when packages are being delivered](https://imgur.com/a/cDv2V) etc.",1523681532,dxc9dfw,t3_8apy86,t1_dx4mfmx,/r/smarthome/comments/8apy86/outdoor_ip_camera_recommendations/dxc9dfw/,2,smarthome

Please show me the whitepaper where they make that claim . All they have said is that they store data using a unique 'Siri ID' instead of anonymous key credential authentication for each request - not that that can't easily be bypassed either if they wanted to.

&gt; but why go through the trouble since they could choose to embed your username in every query and make their lives easier if they truly wanted to track your sessions.

To gloat about privacy when in reality they have little to talk about it.

&gt; But they want to avoid the issue of subpoenas by them not having the data to provide in the first place... so it would make no sense for them to circumvent that and give themselves the ability to track users and then be forced to deal with the big legal battle of not complying with subpoenas.

They'll have the data on their servers, they changed their privacy settings to allow themselves to do so - you are saying that they they themselves don't know what your SiriID - which is trivial to figure out - as long as the SiriID is a unique identifier and not a anonymous token generated per request.

It took moving to another system to realize just how awful many of the design decisions of ST are. The list of problems with it is quite long:

Cloud based

No built in rules engine (Webcore is NOT built in, and introduces a **second** cloud dependency)

No built in web page building, and what exists 3rd party is VERY limited compared to other systems, especially what I moved to.

The online community at the time was all ""well if a smartApp doesn't do what you want, just code it yourself in Groovy.""

The SmartApp model is ridiculous--a crutch thrown at the system after the bone-headed choice to not have a built in rules engine. Result is you need multiple SmartApps to do what you want with any given device. I also once was advised by ST support to delete a device and re-add it to get it working. Well guess what, it was part of FOURTEEN different SmartApps. That took a damn long time, and then I had to add it back!

No real logging. You have to turn logging on BEFORE you want to see the log. So dumb. When I notice a problem I want to go see what caused it, not go turn on the log so I can see next time.

No Desktop client

No integration with Mac OS (or any OS for that matter,) which allows tremendous superpowers.

Clunky 3rd party iTunes support

But #1: **reliability was truly terrible.** Unbelievably bad. I used ST during what was apparently the year of hell, where multiple developers for the platform all pulled their plugins in protest. (I hear this is better now but don't care, I'm done with ST.) I recognized some of these failings while I was using it obviously. But I didn't truly realize how awful the user experience is until I switched to Indigo. Again, I got more done in the first weekend of using Indigo than I did in a year of using ST. And now, my HA does more than any ST system ever will.

Most people here tell me that ST has been reliable for them for a long time. But what guarantee do I have that I won't experience another year of hell if I tried it again? None. I have nearly two years of experience with Indigo that shows me the system is extremely reliable, and that any problem I have will be addressed in very short order from either the very responsive devs or from helpful people in the user community.

zyberwoof,"In this context, a hub is the device that other devices connect to.  It is a bridge between different technologies.  Your router at home is your ""hub"" for Wi-Fi.  Smartthings is a ""hub"" for Z-Wave and Zigbee.  The Hue ""hub"" is what all of the Hue bulbs talk to.  Your Google Home or Echo isn't really what is being referred to here.

Another term to use would be the ""brain"".  The brain is the thing that controls all of the logic.  A lot of the times the brain is in the hub.  For example, your router at home is also the brain that dictates how networking is handled, in addition to bridging your WAN to your Wi-Fi and your LAN.  A Smartthings can also be the brain to control your automation.  Once again, a Home or Echo are pretty weak brains.  They can do a tiny amount of automation, but not much.  And just based on verbal input.

So to get started, the things you need to decide on are

* Brain: What will control your logic.  ""If it is after sunset and motion is detected, turn on lamp.""  Keep in mind that you are best off having only 1 brain if you can. Otherwise logic can get confusing.
* Hubs: If you want to control your entertainment center, you may want a Logitech hub.  If you specifically want Hue bulbs, get a Hue hub.  But if you just want to control lights, you may just need to get a Smartthings that can control Zigbee and Z-wave.  You may very well need more than one hub.  Each hub costs money, so it is nice to minimize these.  Also, you may combine the brain and hub in many cases.
* Input: Home and Echo are voice input.  They let you perform automation based on what you say.  Motion detectors are also input, as are thermometers, door sensors, water detectors, and more.  You typically have to have the appropriate hub to work with these.  A router covers your for Home, Echo, and Wi-Fi devices.  Zigbee, Z-wave, and bluetooth are other possibilities.  
* Output: What happens.  Light bulbs turn on and off.  Doors lock.  Chromecasts start playing videos.  Power outlets turn on.  Thermostats adjust.  Just like the Input devices, you need the appropriate hub for these.  

To give an example, my home looks like this:

* Brain: Samsung Smartthings hub.  
* Hubs: Smartthings for Zigbee and Z-wave.  My normal Wi-Fi router for Wi-Fi.  
* Input: Google Homes (Wi-Fi).  Motion detectors (Z-wave).  Door and garage door sensors (Z-wave).  
* Output: 2 power outlets (Z-wave).  Chromecasts (Wi-Fi) for video.  Cheap Sengled bulbs (Zigbee).  

**To answer your original question**

All you need is a Wi-Fi camera that has the option to email your when it detects motion.  There are a bunch on Amazon.  Use Fakespot.com to help weed out the junk.  If you are savvy, get a camera without cloud integration to minimize privacy issues.  If you aren't savvy and want something easy, then get one with cloud integration.

Everything else I outlined above is how you go down the rabbit hole of home automation.  But for this one request, you just need a camera and no other home automation.

There are many, many options for a system to do what you want and much more, but I encourage you to NOT jump at the first thing recommended without doing all your research to understand what the end-user experience is like with any system you're considering.

quarl0w,"Again, this may be true of cameras/firmware of old, but I can see today, in the last 10 minutes, that my cameras are requesting api.us.xiaoyi.com, using the DHCP supplied DNS (not even coming from the router, this is direct cam to PiHole). So maybe they have a hardcoded primary, and accept DHCP as secondary?  I doubt it, but sure, I guess it's possible. 

I know separately from my router logs that unless I view the feed remotely the cameras use about 1 MB of badwidth per day, vs 5 MB for my Ecobee. So they aren't sending video to the cloud.  I can watch video live for hours, or review previous footage from the SD card, from within my network and still see no outward data usage. 

I was skeptical at first. The price and features is too good to be true. But all of my concerns have been invalidated when I dig just a little bit into my network stats. 

I'm not a tin foil hat TOS worrier. Have you read Apple's TOS for the iPhone, or Google's for any of their products?  There is no expectation of privacy for **any** device connected to the internet. If I was worried about that I would go full on PoE NVR set up. Because any camera that connects to the internet to allow remote viewing and motion alerts must have some server side integration. They couldn't work otherwise. That's the price of simplicity in set up and convenience of use.  

You have to ask yourself if saving hundreds of dollars every year without sacrificing any features is worth more than your personal piece of mind for the crazy what if scenarios you can dream up.

ajeoae,"Depends on  what level of privacy you're concerned about.

- Are you concerned that they will snoop in on your day to day conversations?  If so you'll likely be fine, they only record and transmit what is said after their wake-up word.  Security specialists have monitored the hell out of these things and have found no evidence they are actively spying on people.

- Are you concerned that a voiceprint and profile will be made via your interactions of the device?  This will be the more likely case with these devices.  And it'll come down to how concerned you are on the usage of that data once you've given it over.

This next part is highly subjective, but of the two products, I'd err with Amazon for the sake of privacy.  This is mostly because their primary goal with their assistant is to sell you products.  With Google Home, selling you products is secondary to data mining your habits, preferences, and other details.  Most of the telemetry either device collects is used for improving results of the service to meet your needs.  With Google, there's a higher chance that telemetry data is going to be shared with 3rd party advertisers as you become more a part of the product than a customer.  Granted, the AMOUNT of information shared is still fairly abstract and impersonal. 

That doesn't mean these companies don't store very personal information about you over time...it's just that the likeliness of them sharing that information fully is low.  That doesn't mean however that either company is immune to a data breach...and then it's a matter of whether the information exfiltrated from a breach is useful at all to an attacker.

I have a huge family as in 8 kids and so we can not use Google Fi.  But that would keep a ton of data away from are wireless provider including where we go in the physical world and when we go.    All of this is kept from the carriers and goes to Google if you use it.

Apple gets the data with my iPhone but I tend to use my Pixel more and more.   Plus Amazon gets are buying habits data.    We really do not use the Echo any longer and instead switched to the Google Home.

The 2nd organization I would trust after Google would be Amazon.

Depends on the router.  They *SHOULD* be isolated that way but don't even get me started on the security of most home routers...

There are also some ""almost"" systems: **Hue** can automate and react to sensors, but mostly only its own sensors and only its own lights and switches. But most of the systems above can take over and fully integrate Hue into a broader system.

The *way* these work are often very different, by which I mean the way you set up an automation, and the ease of troubleshooting, monitoring and adjusting things. Their degrees of privacy-guarding also vary a lot, and their level of dependency on an internet connection.

Your comment about extras is well taken: For example, most people think Indigo is quite expensive to start, but when you look at all the compatibility that's built in vs. HomeSeer, where you have to buy and buy and buy add ons if you want to add, say Hue lights, Indigo is a bargain.

SirEDCaLot,"This is not actually true.  

The simplest way some remote start kits do this, is you embed a spare key in the remote start module and it sends the key's signal to an antenna located right next to the ignition lock.  Thus, car thinks it has a legit key.  

Otherwise it's all just data bus stuff within the car.  The remote start can send the same commands as the ignition lock, IE 'authenticated key has just asked to start the car' and the car starts.  

Also, most of the 'security to prevent the car from being stolen' is a joke.  Read up on the systems- they are generally pretty bad (especially the wireless component).

Xpawn70,"The problem with ""overloading"" the router normally occurs when the router can't handle the number of devices on the LAN, or the devices themselves generate a lot of traffic for some reason. How many devices your router can handle can actually vary with the firmware version, so no definitive answer on that one. 

I, personally, have some bad experiences with wifi-devices for smart home, so I run most of my house on Zigbee via 3 different gateways (3 separate zigbee mesh networks). And if you plan on expanding your smart home at a later time, I would strongly suggest noting down your demands in functionality and buy a smart hub according to that.

You can/should go for one of the big 2: Z-wave or Zigbee. There are also 433MHz based systems, though 433MHz has some (potentially big) security issues (the probability for some hacking your 433MHz devices, turning your lights on or off, is miniscule, though). 433MHz is the oldest system, anyway, and includes a lot of different protocols, including X10, and virtually no security or encryption.

Both Zigbee and Z-Wave has built-in encryption and a certain resilience to signal noise. They also build their own mesh-networks, which means ""every device"" will talk to all it's neighboring devices and maintaining a ""map"" of possible routes to/from other devices or the gateway, in the possibility of device is removed or added. This will also extend the reach of the mesh network, since all mains-powered devices will work as an extender/repeater.

The gateway/hub/controller (many names for the same device) will connect with most/all your smart devices, such as light bulbs, outlets, smart curtains and so on, and will also handle the communication between Google Assistant, Alexa, Homekit and your personal devices such as iPhone, Android phones, tablets etc. 

Since the gateway will handle all signals between the LAN/internet and your devices you will only have one device on your LAN, namely the gateway. 

SO, waiting for IPv6 support is really not necessary if you choose the correct technology today, since only the gateway will be exposed on the LAN.

And again, presonally, I would stay far away from wifi-based single devices anyway, due to some very bad experiences, such as overloading my wifi, excessive network traffic and such, but YMMV.

A ""smart"" gateway will in most cases not give you these problems, plus the gateways often give you a certain degree of automation and/or timers for events",1574877314,f8vu4u7,t3_e2co0t,t3_e2co0t,/r/homeautomation/comments/e2co0t/should_i_wait_for_wifi_6_smart_bulbs/f8vu4u7/,1,homeautomation

Installation is very simple - you need to connect four wires (supplied) to the module, disconnect power from your alarm panel, mount the module on provided clips (my box had a proper mounting slot already) or using a double-sided sticky foam (also provided), connect those four wires to keypad terminals, connect the module to Ethernet and reconnect the power). 

If you have DSC panel, you don’t need any additional configuration, but you will need to program your Honeywell system to recognize the module. 

You will need an Ethernet port nearby. I just reused my old power line adapters, but you can also use wireless bridge if you don’t have wired Ethernet. 

Home Assistant works with it out of the box, you just need to add a few lines to configuration file and restart. You don’t even need to create an account with EnvisaLink - it works just fine without it and doesn’t require cloud access. Registering will give you ability to update firmware though.

The trick is to block their access to the internet in your router. 

Amazon is remote killing them, so it can never connect to the internet, but that’s okay, because dasshio only senses their wake-up network discovery. It doesn’t matter if their transaction is actually completed. 

So, to use one in home assistant without amazon murdering it:

1. Hold the button until the light turns blue and pulses, about 6 seconds. 

2.  Connect to the ‘Amazon ConfigureMe’ WiFi network with your phone or a laptop.

3. Point your browser at 192.168.0.1

4. Write down the MAC address. 

5. Point your browser at 192.168.0.1/?amzn_ssid={{your wifi ssid}}&amp;amzn_pw={{your WiFi password}} 

Note that you’ll need to url encode any spaces or special characters. Google this if you need to. 

6. The dash button will shut off as soon as you hit enter. *DO NOT PRESS THE BUTTON AGAIN OR IT WILL DIE*. I killed 3 before I figured this out. 

7.  Switch back to your real WiFi and connect to your router’s configuration page. 

8.  This part will change depending on your router. You want to block that MAC address from connecting to the internet, but it must be able to communicate locally. 

I have a net fear router, so my process was to assign a static IP to that MAC address, then under the Block Services option of the Security tab, block access to the internet on all ports to the ip range I’m assigning to my dash buttons. Save and reboot. 

Now it’s safe to press the button. Do so. The first press will go white for a few seconds, then it will turn red and flash a few times. Press the button again. If all goes well, it should pulse white for 30 seconds or so then go black with no red. 

Now just configure dasshio and you’re good to go.

dnelson0817,"This is the guide I found from the [Smartthings Community](https://community.smartthings.com/t/adt-pulse-help/77538)  I’m not sure if it’ll work since I can’t seem to open it myself so I’ll just copy it too: 


“I figured I would post a quick reply here in case other folks are looking.
About 2 months ago, I had ADT pulse installed. They installed 3 security cameras, updated my panel electronics, added the ADT Pulse Z-Wave gateway (the black one by Netgear), 1 Z-Wave door lock, 1 Z-Wave garage door opener, 1 Z-Wave plug-in switch, and 1 Wireless keypad.
All of this stuff worked great…and I became addicted to having a “smart house”.
Since their install, I have added 22 Z-Wave switches (a few are dimmers). I used the new GE/Jasco Z-Wave plus switches. Also, added a few 3-way (and 1 4-way) switch.
At first, I was in heaven. However, the ADT Pulse automation couldn’t do everthing what I wanted to do.
I bought a SmartThings Ver 2 hub, and added it as a secondary Z-Wave controller! Yay…more automation possibilities.
To add the SmartThings hub as a secondary controller, go into the ADT Pulse portal on your PC, and put it into the “add a new Z-Wave device” mode. (System --&gt; Manage Devices --&gt; Devices --&gt; Add). When it starts doing the “spinny thingy”, go into your SmartThings IDE on your PC --&gt; My Hubs --&gt; Utilities (View Utilities) --&gt; Z-Wave Utilities --&gt; Join/Leave another Z-Wave Network.)
This has to be done while the ADT Pulse system is looking for a new Z-Wave device.
The ADT Pulse system will time out and say that it can’t find a compatible device, however it will give the SmartThings Hub a Z-Wave address.
Now, go into your SmartThings smartphone App --&gt; My Home --&gt; Things --&gt; Add a Thing. Let it look for devices…it takes a bit of time to find all of the Z-Wave devices.
When it’s done, the Z-Wave devices connected to the ADT Pulse will now be available in SmartThings. Make sure to “Refresh Mesh” in the ADT Pulse system when SmartThings is done (System --&gt; Manage Devices --&gt; Devices --&gt; “Refresh Mesh”) so that the SmartThings node does the Z-Wave repeating properly.
With this setup, you can control Z-Wave devices from either system.
Whatever the ADT Pulse system does for polling is superior to SmartThings. The ADT Pulse will always find a SmartThings Z-Wave activation within a few minutes (on my 30-ish node system). The SmartThings doesn’t always get a device activation done by ADT Pulse.
The ADT Pulse gets manual activations with the same reliability as a SmartThings activations. However, the SmartThings doesn’t always get manual activations.
To make this better, I installed the “codersaur : Z-Wave Tweaker” utility to set the “Life Line” associations to both the ADT Pulse hub and the SmartThings hub. When I did this, both the ADT Pulse and SmartThings see manual activations within 1 second.
For “key logic” events that I implemented in CoRE that “need to know” when the ADT Pulse does something, I implemented a polling routine (it samples 2 Z-Wave devices).
Needless to say, I have had several Nergasms while doing all of this. I told my wife that a “Smart House” is my mid-life crsis!
Since this, I have added Zigbee devices into the SmartThings.
SmartThings isn’t 100%, but it’s getting there.

* Extra wires to the attic or crawlspace, so they can be run later down walls as needed.
* Speaker wires to the places in the ceiling where you \*might\* want surround speakers.  In the future you can punch through the drywall and pull them out where you need them.  You can zig-zag staple the wires between two joists or studs to make it easy to find when you later punch a hole.

I used to install them for a home security/home automation company (we installed the Honeywell branded Skybell, the Alarm.com branded Skybell, and the regularly packaged Skybell Skybell...sigh) and they were interchangeable between all services, but once we connected them to the network they would of course auto-update the firmware.

I’ve been out of that position about a year now but I’d be surprised if it’s not still the case.

ShowMeTheMonee,"Hi, 

Can you say more about what you actually want to achieve from home automation and a smart home? You mention security and the roborock - are you also thinking about heating? Lighting? controlling appliances? 

How do you want to control the appliances? With voice? with physical switches? with tablets or a remote to control scenes? 

Are you an apple household? Android? Amazon? indifferent? 

Would you prefer a solution which is all set up, or would you like to be able to customise it yourself? Are you ok with some programming or you want to avoid that? 

Given that home automation can sometimes have some strange behaviours, it might be recommended to keep your home security separate from your home automation system. 

Many people use some kind of z-wave hub (smartthings, homekit, vera etc) plus different modules to control different activities.

My favourite (at least on paper) would be Salto Clay. It has a documented api and seems like a very solid system.

Evva airkey seems like a nice system as well, although getting access to their api is pretty expensive.

Salto also has their older non-saas system XS4, which could be good alternative to Salto clay.

The one I really want is a complete lock set for a system with multiple bolts (sorry don’t know the English word for it), benefitting radaris evolution. A little over €1000 per door unfortunately. This system keeps track of the state of the lock and door, so you can see in the app if your door is actually closed and locked

I don’t want an uncontrolled knob on the inside and hence need rfid knobs on both sides which makes the system really expensive.

For me it is a much better design to have the electronic lock and not use a mechanical lock and piggyback a electronic solution. the number of mechanical failures that you can read on forums about the august kinda scared me.

Mailbox has a small microswitch in it that when the mailbox is opened - a light in my office and another in my kitchen turn blue, then Alexa announces ""The mail is here."" Also opens the visitor gate if the mail lady has packages. I tell Alexa to ""reset the mail lights"" and the two bulbs go back to white.

I have a simple smart bulb (color) that's just plugged into a wall socket in our bedroom. If either garage door is open, it comes on with a color indicating which garage door I left open. (Reminder for me if I leave a garage door open.) I don't have garage door controllers though, I find it a huge security risk. It's one thing to unlock a door remotely - you can't see that from the street. A wide-open garage door on the other hand..

Both our bedlights have smart bulbs in them - we each have an Aeotec minimote (4 buttons) that button one controls our own nightlight, button two controls the other's bedlight. I have them setup in a group in Alexa and I can tell her to ""turn the bed lights on"" (or off) so I don't have to walk or crawl to the other side of the bed just to turn a light on or off. That way if I leave my light on and fall asleep, my wife can turn my light off without disturbing me (or vice versa.) We also have a ""gentle wake up"" routine that gradually ramps up the bed lights in the morning to help us wake up. Same remote controls the ceiling fan and light, too.

I also have two (color) bulbs at each entrance and at our front door; we set them to change color every month to be a little festive, i.e. December is red/green.

Wireless is great for mobile devices like phones, tablets, and laptops. Anything mission critical like security and especially life safety I’ll never trust to wireless.

All that said, I couldn’t agree more OP, the availability of affordable cameras and home automation with POE is woefully overlooked. I have cheated and used the POE to 5V micro-usb splitters before to provide power to a rPi on the end of a POE run before, so there are some tricks but that’s not always an option.

Edit: and yes I’m aware of the pi’s poe hat option, learned of it right *AFTER* I ordered the splitter",1574050172,f7x9pog,t3_dxmpfd,t1_f7v9tn6,/r/homeautomation/comments/dxmpfd/why_are_poe_devices_so_few_and_far_between_with/f7x9pog/,5,homeautomation
cran,"POE has a bit of a problem. The wires used in Cat5 and 6 can't carry a lot of amps; about a third of an amp max. A useful current needs go at a higher voltage then be converted down to get a more useful amp level. Unlike USB which can be used directly at 5v or easily resisted down to 3v, at a useful amp level, POE is high voltage and converting it down is not trivial. If you are fine stepping high voltage down, just use the house current with a transformer. If you need both power and a signal by wire, just use shielded USB. If you want a signal wired throughout your house, I'd have to ask why. Ethernet security is terrible; you don't really want your network wired all over the house. WiFi is what most applications need; it's high throughput and secure.",1574032905,f7wg18a,t3_dxmpfd,t3_dxmpfd,/r/homeautomation/comments/dxmpfd/why_are_poe_devices_so_few_and_far_between_with/f7wg18a/,0,homeautomation

There are dozens of you.  Dozens!

Being serious- the overwhelming majority of home users have little or no Cat5/Cat6 in their walls, and if they do it's terminated with RJ11 phone jacks.  The average homeowner knows nothing of Cat-anything cable, PoE, etc and if you try to explain to them the benefits of a PoE infrastructure their response will be 'wait, you mean I have to buy ANOTHER thing?  No thanks'.

OP, you're obviously not a moron, so why are you messing around with the consumer level crap?  You obviously know something about networks, do some research and learn some stuff about HA and security.  

Look into Ubiquiti and Synology.  

Ubiquiti makes an awful lot of stuff, but you'd want the Cloud Key Gen2+ NVR and the UniFi Video cameras.  All are PoE.  And the app is very easy to use.  Upside- easy setup, downside- you're locked into Ubiquiti cameras.  

Synology is your other choice.  They make NAS devices, but even their low end NAS boxes make great NVRs.  Their Surveillance Station has a very easy to use app (for mobile and desktop), and unlike Ubiquiti, it supports virtually all makes and models of cameras (except the proprietary cloud stuff like Ring/Nest/etc).  Hikvision makes a nice video doorbell, or DoorBird is the other (albeit expensive) option.  For cameras try Amcrest.  

Either way you'll have a total budget in the same range as your Ring/Nest type setup, but no monthly fees, and it'll be just as easy to use.",1574012278,f7u7je2,t3_dxmpfd,t3_dxmpfd,/r/homeautomation/comments/dxmpfd/why_are_poe_devices_so_few_and_far_between_with/f7u7je2/,1,homeautomation

What I like most about it:

1. Both Z-Wave and ZigBee
2. It's compatible with just about any device
3. If there is a device that is not compatible, the community has most likely developed a device handler and we are back at 2
4. WebCore - this makes automation so simple, even a Cave Man could do it

Over the past two years, the hub has lost the ability to control devices (do to SmartThings platform outages) probably 4 or 5 times.  For this reason, I will not use it for a security system...a security system just has to work all of the time.

If my hub broke, I would go out and buy another one...hands down.

I have built out both a Z-Wave and ZigBee network at my house.  The new SmartThings sensors (leak sensor, motion sensor, etc) are ZigBee.  I just like knowing if my A/C drip pan is leaking, or that my gun safe is open, etc.  I also have a Sonos sound system, and have the SmartThings talking through that (it's cool having a talking house...the front door is open...the front door is unlocked...the garage door is open...the Lord of the Manor, King of the Castle is arriving (my dog loves this one).

I_Arman,"I have the same thermostat you do, so all I can offer is hearsay... But, that being said:

The thermostat I had before my CT101 was made in the 1970s. It worked fine, it just didn't connect to my other smart stuff. I'm fully confident that the CT101 I've got will last another 30 years. Thermostats that use Wi-Fi, however... Not so much. I have a couple devices that don't work with modern Wi-Fi security, and many more that won't work on 5GHz. If I upgrade my network, those devices are useless.

If you move, will the device stay behind? I'm content to leave my Z-Wave stuff, with some notes on how to take over the system; it's a lot harder to take over a bunch of Wi-Fi devices - not to mention removing them from your account in the first place.

Wi-Fi is also going to be a security hole; Z-Wave is local only, like Zigbee, X10, even Bluetooth, so you don't have to worry about every single device being fully updated - not that you can even control that with most devices. Because most Wi-Fi devices punch a hole through your network, if they aren't updated, they are going to get targeted.

Wi-Fi devices don't extend the network, either, so you have to be careful about the range of your router, or spend a lot more getting a mesh network.

Finally, while (specifically) SmartThings supports Ecobee now, there is a chance that it may drop support in future, which means you'll either need a new hub, or a new thermostat. The only way your current thermostat will lose support is if Z-Wave goes away, which doesn't seem likely at this point.

Lots of cons... Now, pros!

The Ecobee 3 looks really nice. The CT101 looks pretty basic, but the ecobee just looks *pretty*.

gandzas,"If you want to use smart switches, make sure that you run the hot and the neutral to the switch location.  Some people will say to use smart bulbs, but pairing them with dumb switches means that sometimes people turn off the switch and the bulbs are useless. Plus, one smart switch can control many lights - so if you are having a number of recessed lights, it might be easier and way more cost effective.  My dining room light has 6 bulbs, so a smart switch is cheaper than 6 bulbs. If you are concerned with being able to control color that means using bulbs - it's fun at first, but loses it's appeal after a while. I use LED strips and and other types of fixtures for most of my color changing options.  I only have one color LIFX bulb in a lamp that I use to signal issues (green for back door left open,purple for water leak, when away I set it to blink red to signify any number of triggers to notify my neighbors).

As for hubs - I use smartthings - the community usually has ways to integrate anything if it's not available from the app - but if you are looking for native control, there are many options that work.  Leak sensors, water shutoffs, motion detectors, contact sensors, smart locks all run best on zwave or zigbee - The only WiFi options I have are my main thermostat, Lifx lights and nestcams.

LiveMike78,"Agree with this. Automation in voice assistants is - in my experience - very limited at the moment (I run Alexa and SmartThings, have played with Google).

What I see a lot of is ""automating"" things by replacing a physical switch with a voice command. This is still manual control, just by a different means. For me, ""home automation"" and/or ""smart home"" means that without manual control the system will execute routines to benefit security, health, comfort or cost. Ideally everything will work in harmony with a person as they go about their day, and without them having to do anything specifically to interact with the automations. Never asking for the temperature to be changed, never switching a light switch or asking for light, etc.

Alexa is integrated into my smart home, but increasingly as an end-point rather than an entry-point. For example, if SmartThings detects a water leak - Alexa will announce where the leak is and keep repeating until it is resolved. If my bedtime routine is executed (again, it's initiated automatically) and SmartThings detects any of my doors are open (usually the garage) then Alexa will announce which door is open so I don't leave it that way all night.

The only time I use Alexa to control anything is to override lights, or occasionally to turn off the Xbox my kid has left on - but as I increase the sensors and complexity of my automation it is becoming rarer and rarer.

To the point that when I broke my home network the other day and had to walk through the house to check on the router. I was confused why it was so dark - I have got so used to my lights coming on automatically when it's dark that I forgot that rooms could get dark. It was a weird realization I'd become used to not experiencing the dark in parts of my house.

DavidAg02,"The main advantage to the true home automation hubs like SmartThings, Hubitat and Home Assistant is that you get a much more power automation engine.

For example, I have a Goodbye routine that turns off the lights, locks the doors, closes the garage, arms my security system, makes sure my TV/electronics are turned off, turns off the A/C, warns me if I've left any windows or doors open, etc. That activates without me having to do anything at all. I just leave and it happens. It's also smart enough to not do it until the last person has left the house. If I have guests in the house, and I leave while they are there, it's very easy to override with with a ""Guest"" mode that keeps it from activating even though I leave the house. 

I have a Welcome Home routine that does all the opposite... the house is ready the way I like it as soon as I drive up to my house. No voice commands or anything are necessary.

That level of complexity with automations just isn't possible yet on the voice assistants. It may be someday, but not yet.",1573017265,f6ogpzb,t3_dsbll9,t3_dsbll9,/r/smarthome/comments/dsbll9/would_investing_in_smart_things_be_worth_it_if/f6ogpzb/,1,smarthome
johnwayne2413,"This is what a reviewer on Amazon said:  


&gt; May 30, 2018  
&gt;  
&gt;Style: myQ Smart Garage Hub  
&gt;  
&gt;You’re looking for a solution to open your garage door from a remote location. Package deliveries, the housekeeper, your tool-hoarding neighbor. This is one of several products out there that will do the trick.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’re a garage door tech, move along. You know this already. If your a DIY homeowner with grand plans, you must read on - This is what Chamberlain should tell you about their system but doesn’t.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;While generally easy to install, without an Introduction or Basic Principles of Operation as a preamble, you will likely have the same issues I did. Read on for the lessons I learned and tips that will save your hair. I will explain each of the major elements of the system and provide suggestions to improve your probability of a successful installation.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Door sensor: This sensor communicates with the smart hub using Bluetooth to indicate door operation and open/ closed condition. During installation it is paired to the smart hub which is best performed with the unit attached to a closed door between 3’ and 10’ from the smart hub. By design, Bluetooth distance is limited to 33’ but don’t count on consistent operation at this extreme end of the range. Consider this distance during installation and future operation.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Your 2.4ghz cordless phones, baby monitors, etc., can cause Bluetooth interference. Get them out. If your wireless router has a setting for Bluetooth coexistence, enable it.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Your Wireless (Wi-Fi) Network: The Chamberlain documentation says that 2 bars of 2.4ghz WiFi signal is enough for consistent operation. This can be checked by looking on your phone. I say, your mileage may vary. I installed a dedicated access point for the smart hub as I couldn’t get the system to work reliably. A wired connection is also supported.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Configure the smart hub with a static IP Address on your wireless network. This will help ensure the Chamberlain service can reach the smart hub quickly and easily when you activate the door. The additional time for the router or server to lookup a dynamic IP Address and establish a connection could create timing issues.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Smart Hub: The smart hub includes a Bluetooth receiver for the door sensor, a 2.4 ghz radio to connect to your wireless home network for the system to communicate with Chamberlain’s servers on the internet, and a radio frequency (RF) transmitter to send HomeLink rolling codes to your garage door opener (on a channel in the 300-400mhz range depending on your garage door opener) - just like your remote clicker.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**I discovered that the RF transmitter in the smart hub is fairly weak. While your car can transmit a signal a half block away, the smart hub can't. The instructions make a recommendation for placement of the smart hub but will make an explicit statement here - install it within the 4-6’ “recommendation”. Consider this when planning your installation. Apparently, orientation is important for maximum reach. If it doesn’t work reliably, flip it 180 degrees on its mount. Finally, like other garage door remotes, if it loses power you might have to re-program the system with the garage door learn button. They don’t tell you this so I will.**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the smart hub needs to be located where it can communicate with; 1) the door sensor (Bluetooth), 2) the garage door opener (RF) and, 3) your wireless (WiFi) network to work consistently! Each has its own distance limitations so placement of the hub is critical.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Your garage door opener: You obviously have one to which you are adding this system. Do your homework and make sure it’s compatible before you buy. If you’re not positive, call or email them with your make and model numbers in hand. Mine is a Craftsman (Chamberlain) made in 1999 with the door sensors so I was good to go. NOTE: Garage door openers have a limit to the number of remotes they can support. My Craftsman supports 4 remotes. With two HomeLink-connected cars, the remote door opener, and the smart hub I am now at the max allowed by my opener. As a result, I had to decommission my ""clickers"". Do your homework and factor this into your plans.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Phone App: A basic, functional, app with a few frills. It works well enough though some settings are best changed on the web site (that I didn’t know about). When installing the smart hub your phone will need to be on your 2.4ghz wireless network to complete the setup. After that, it doesn’t matter what your phone is connected to - your home network or a cell connection. The system can be setup entirely from your phone. I set up an open alert, a close alert and a 10pm door not closed reminder. The alerts can be sent to you via Text or email.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Chamberlain service: Does not support Alexa or IFTTT (without a fee) and that’s fine for me. I always have my phone handy and I don’t need the security concerns that come with IFTTT. Also, multi-user accounts are not (yet) supported. I just program the wife’s phone with the same username/ password and off we go.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The system is fairly rudimentary and in my opinion could use some added intelligence. If the system components exchanged more status information it could probably avoid situations where the “door \[is\] not responding” or better error status information could be presented to the user. Sometimes I think it’s just that Chamberlain's servers are slow.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;LED &amp; Florescent lights: I hear you asking “why is this important?”. Both can emit radio and electromagnetic interference that can mask the signal between the smart hub and your opener. If you experience unreliable operation - out they go. The last thing I did was remove an LED lamp from a motion sensor fixture nearby and replaced it with a standard incandescent. Since the light is only on for a few minutes I’m not worried about the power usage if it means the garage door will close when commanded.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I give Chamberlain credit for trying to make the install easy. Considering the different operating environments and variables, it’s a challenge to cover all the bases. Unfortunately, a quick start guide simply isn’t enough in this case and the online instructions are no better. They have made some assumptions about what you need to know (or don't need to know). The above precautions should be spelled out to avoid customer frustration and reduce the number of calls to their help desk (and returned product).  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The good news for me is that after 2 months of trial and error and multiple calls and emails to their help desk, I think we may finally have all the issues cleared up. My fingers are crossed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Now you know everything Chamberlain should tell you but doesn't. Best of luck!",1573009873,f6o7wli,t3_ceh4t2,t3_ceh4t2,/r/homeautomation/comments/ceh4t2/chamberlain_myq_do_you_have_to_mount_it_on_the/f6o7wli/,1,homeautomation

VMU_kiss,"Honestly there are many issues when it comes to security of the smart home.  
  
1) Laser voice - Simple and easy attack that can be done from outside (you can do it with a laser pointer, 2 x 1.5v batteries and a headphone jack)  
  
2) ultrasound - This is audio that we cannot hear as a human but the smart speaker still hears so another simple attack vector but doing this on normal speakers you may hear a noise/whine  
  
3) Directional Speaker - A more costly effort but basically a beam of sound so unless someone goes near the beam they can't hear it and it could be used with a laser microphone to record peoples commands and play back with these methods.  
  
4) vibration speakers - A simple device when placed on a window turns it into a speaker so could be used to pump sound into the room with the speaker.
  
There are a lot of vectors with this system I myself tested out a light based security hole recently (Just having fun) I was able to have a smart bulb blink/dim to communicate data and all i did was record the windows from the street and parse the data from the video. Now this isn't much of a concern as I was doing it for fun but it could be used to extract data from a network that has no internet connection (Has be used to blink a HDD led on a pc and a drone with camera recorded the flashes to retrieve the data on a non-connected PC)  
  
We have a lot of possible attack vectors but as Home Owners if you have your network safe from the internet then your set as anything where someone is physically close it's easier to just break in and is the more likely option of happening.",1573000481,f6nup0c,t3_drsm2g,t3_drsm2g,/r/homeautomation/comments/drsm2g/laserbased_voice_assistant_abuse/f6nup0c/,1,homeautomation

No, your car isn’t “nice and stable.” You are shooting a 1mm laser beam a minimum of 50 feet trying to hit a pinhole.

Try and hit a dot from across the room. You won’t. That’s about 10 feet. You need a helluva stability setup and precision devices set up to achieve the level of accuracy required.

2) They must maintain laser contact on a pinhole from an exceptionally long distance. This will take stabilization equipment and an absolute insane level trial and error to get the aim right.

This “exploit” takes a tremendous level of effort, money, and luck to pull off. We aren’t in an Ocean’s 11 movie, this is not going to happen.

But when we're talking about an online service it is a completely different story. Depending on the implementation you easily enter thousands of combinations in a very short time on multiple services simultaneously and nobody will see you doing so (except for the server rejecting all of your failed tries) and even if someone notices, it will be hard for him to argue you are doing anything illegal here.

kigmatzomat,"Homeseer. Has alexa &amp; ghome support, you can buy it preinstalled on a Zee2 (Pi3 with zwave card) for $99 right now or buy just the software for use on your hardware. Has a lot of custom integration options, like security systems and AV components.

Hubitat has more built in radios and piggy backs on a lot of ST groovy code. My only real quibble about it is longevity. They are a new company with no clear indication of their longterm viability. 

Homeseer has been around for 20yrs and sells multiple grades of controllers and some really nice zwave products, which helps diversify their sales. In a TANSTAAFL manner, Homeseer is also supported by their app store. Many of those more complex integrations require purchase (or writing your own version), which supports the dev but also drives away people who want the free lunch.

SpicyMcHaggis666,"Most doors are kicked open or left unlocked and criminals just walk right in. Having a lock, or no lock, on the door knob makes no difference. It's the frame that you need to reinforce as it will break before anything else (and they break EASILY!) Like the saying goes, locks only keep the honest people out. My house has a Schlage Connect deadbolt along with a handle (knob) that doesn't lock. They sell them in sets, although I didn't buy them that way. I have no issues not having a lock on the knob.

Some of the benefits for me and my family:

No keys are needed. I carry no keys in my pockets. (My car doesn't even use a key, just the fob. Well, there is a key inside of it to open the door, but it is hidden within.) If you have kids, you don't need to give them any keys either. And no spare keys for the neighbors.

The lock locks automatically after 30 seconds (which I wish I could change to 1min). So if you have a person in your home that doesn't like locking doors, this will solve that.

You can assign codes that only work at certain times for housekeepers, dog walkers, or whoever might need them. You can even be notified when they use it.

For me, the thing I like the best about this is that in an emergency, like if you are the only one home and you fall and can't get up, you can call 911 and give them the door code. It prevents the FD from kicking in your door or breaking a window to gain entry. I specifically put this in my mom's house just for this reason. You can also use the app on your phone to open the lock.

And probably the second biggest benefit for having one of these on your door is that most burglars will skip your house. That is, most of the ones I have spoken to have said so (I'm a cop). They see that as somebody being more security savvy and they figure they will probably have an alarm, camera system, and/or other deterrent.",1572866261,f6hvkq5,t3_drb7m7,t3_drb7m7,/r/homeautomation/comments/drb7m7/i_dont_get_smart_deadbolts/f6hvkq5/,1,homeautomation

I thought the presence sensors might be good for automation, but they're super slow - way to slow for lighting sensors, so I end up just having a zigbee motion/temperature sensor sitting right next to the Ecobee one anyway. 

If you do choose to go with one of these, though, note that the ecobee will let you have local control with Home Assistant at least (would have to look into hubitat).

1. Location Tracking - My wife and I both have android phones with Google's location history turned on. With no additional app or config on the phone, you get [location tracking](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_maps/) for free. 
   1. If you prefer not to share location with anyone except yourself/your system you can also use [owntracks](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/owntracks/).
2. The phone UI for setting up and making quick changes.
   1. I love being able to actually make changes and do setup on my computer - it's a much better tool for making big changes. But simple changes are definitely still doable on the phone.
   2. The [Lovelace UI](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/) is so much better for quick things on my phone. It's super customizable, and looks good even with zero customization. It's fast, and you can put a bookmark on your home screen that acts just like a native app - no browser chrome or anything.
      1. I used to use the Hue app to control my lights, the wemo app to control some plugs, the myq app to open the garage door, etc because SmartThings was some combination of slow and hard to use. Hubitat's android app looks better than SmartThings, but IMO it's still miles behind Lovelace.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;while keeping things local is fairly important to me, being able to access things remotely via my phone is also important. 

I'm not sure how Hubitat handles this, but I'll say that it's very easy to setup a relatively secure remote access - with https encryption via your browser in Home Assistant. It's also possible to lock it down for a state sponsored attack, should you choose. Home Assistant's security is totally up to you - but a good starting point is the [Securing Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/securing/) page.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm leaning Hubitat because it has built in packages for most things I'd be doing to start, which are fairly simple.

This implies Home Assistant doesn't. It may be true that there are not ""packages"", but after the initial learning curve (which I'd guess is steeper than Hubitat, but I'm not sure honestly), I think you'll find actually automating simple stuff easier in Home Assistant than Hubitat. Check out the [automation examples page](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/examples/). The one thing that may be harder to setup is the Security system, but if you want anything more than an alert when a door opens - eg you want to flash the lights, and/or play a sound on a Google Home if intrusion is detected - those more complicated automations will be much easier in Home Assistant. You can start with the built in [Manual Alarm Control Panel](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual/) in Home Assistant. As with most things, there are likely more options there than in Hubitat's built in alarm thing, which makes initial setup of something dead simple a bit more complicated, but makes setting up anything a bit more complicated much more simple...That sentence might be hard to parse, but it's true!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; don't love to go back and tinker and constantly update to fix things 

I'm only a couple months into automating and setting up everything in a new house (along with working full time, living, etc), so I still do tinker with Home Assistant about once a week. However, I have gone a couple of weeks already without touching anything in the Home assistant config with no problem. That's obviously not a terribly long time, but it's a good indication for me, and a lot of people in the community have more stable setups that have been running for much longer. One thing to note, many people who setup on a rPi have complained of SD cards wearing out. I haven't had this problem, and as mentioned earlier, it looks like you're going to have a server running blue iris anyway, so I'd just run it on that so you don't have to worry about it.",1572740834,f69eikd,t3_dqo17b,t3_dqo17b,/r/homeautomation/comments/dqo17b/planning_a_brand_new_smart_home_hubitat_or_hassio/f69eikd/,2,homeautomation
mike3y,"That’s correct, which is why I spent money on the upgrade. They had a sale going on,

Hubitat is also a decent system with a very active community. I would highly suggest looking at what they have to offer. There’s plenty of wink users transitioning over to their system.

My personal experience is that both systems have been able to deliver the results I’m looking for. Homeseer appears to be slightly faster with a very good event engine (depending on the hardware you use) Plus they have 20 years behind them. However, there current system has very limited zigbee support.

Hubitat on the other hand has very good built in apps, motion lighting, simple lighting, HSM security, and others. Plus their apps and community apps are free.

Hubitat has great zigbee support and most the smart things drivers can be ported over to Hubitat very easily.

Xpawn70,"For alarm, I use a Xiaomi gateway with door/window sensors. It also supports zigbee smart sockets and light bulbs (maximum 30 devices), but I believe it will not integrate with Homekit

My next project is to have the light in my entrance turn red when the alarm is activated, and add some xiaomi/honeywell smoke detectors, hoping they will also double as sirens (maybe removing the need for the separate siren i already use)

SpoonHandle,"Some history on these sensors, Vivint and 2Gig; for anyone interested.

Vivint used to be a Monitronics (now license-agreement-branded Brinks Home Security) dealer and went by APX Alarm. They were by far Monitronics’ largest dealer for many years, using almost exclusively Honeywell alarm systems. They got sued by some other APX Alarm and changed their name to Apex Alarm.

Around this time one of the most successful Honeywell brand reps and one of Honeywell’s chief engineers left Honeywell to make their own alarm system. The new system featured a touch screen and supported z-wave automation devices. They named the company 2Gig (stands for Two Guys In a Garage, which pokes fun at Honeywell, who would supposedly say to their employees not to worry about the guys in a garage)

2Gig approached Apex Alarm, who loved the direction that 2Gig was going with their alarm systems. The owner of Apex invested heavily in 2Gig and they made plans on using the new alarm system. Since the primary 2Gig engineer came from Honeywell and Apex was such a huge Honeywell dealer with so much wireless Honeywell equipment already out in customer homes, it made perfect sense for 2Gig to use the 345mhz frequency in order to use Honeywell wireless sensors that were already installed.

Apex was also wanting to move away from being a dealer for Monitronics and keep all of their accounts. They acquired a central station from Protection One and began monitoring their own accounts instead of selling them off to Monitronics. After many law suits and a terrible company reputation Apex rebranded as Vivint.

So yeah, that is how 2Gig and Vivint partnered up.

Vivint now has a newer Sky panel, which is manufactured for them by 2Gig, but no longer uses Alarm.com and is proprietary to Vivint.

I have lots of details on the history and rise of Qolsys as well if anyone is interested..",1572508106,f5vzily,t3_dp7eqj,t3_dp7eqj,/r/homeautomation/comments/dp7eqj/anyone_know_what_kind_of_window_sensor_this_is_or/f5vzily/,1,homeautomation
sethdaniel2011,"I moved from SmartThings to Home Assistant about 5 months ago when I moved to a new house, and I had some similar concerns. 

TL;DR version answering your questions:

On the security front: there are nice built-in ""[Alerts](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alert/)"" that can be set to monitor for certain devices remaining in certain states for certain time periods and send you notifications on any notification system you have set up. There is also a built-in [Alarm Panel](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual/) that has a lot of options and can be setup pretty much anyway you want.

Locks: I have a couple of z-wave locks - you can lock and unlock them and set codes remotely. The interface isn't the prettiest, and there doesn't appear to be much retry logic - it took me a couple of tries to set codes on one occasion - but it's certainly possible.

Remote access: In short, yes you can create and edit scripts away from your server. For your example, it's very easy - assuming you're talking about the toilet in your own home. Longer version: Home Assistant is as secure or insecure as you want it to be. It's easy to setup relatively secure access with https with [letsencrypt and duckdns](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/duckdns/). If you have a VPN you can also do that. If you want, you can set up [nginx](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/ecosystem/nginx/) as a proxy as well.

Here's a high note version of my findings from moving a few months ago:

A first note - as a test, you can just integrate SmartThings into Home Assistant and get an idea for the platform. You'll lose some of the benefits - all local (much faster) control, still reliant on Samsung's servers, etc, but it's a good way to get your feet wet without risking losing anything. You can setup the below linked Lovelace interface, alerts, and an alarm panel and if you decide you like it, it's easy enough to either rename the devices to match what they were as SmartThings, or rename the devices in your configs for the three things to have continuity if you officially switch.

In general Home Assistant is much more flexible by default. The front end is much faster and more useful - I ended up paying for ActionTiles just to have a usable quick phone interface on SmartThings, but Home Assistants's default [lovelace](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/) interface is faster, more powerful, easier to customize, and prettier than anything I got on SmartThings. There are many ""built-in"" options, though this generally just means you need to write some yaml to configure a thing instead of write the Python to do the thing yourself. There's little as ""friendly"" as SmartThings all phone-centric UI for adding/managing devices, but you get a lot more power in being able to use a computer to do things (while retaining the ability to do it on your phone)

On top of this, I never wrote a bit of Groovy for my SmartThings setup, but I used a lot of Groovy stuff written by random other people in github (nest, Neato, lighting groups, etc) and even paid for rboy apps to integrate some things like my garage door opener and MonoPrice Z-wave sensors. I did try to review some of the code, but much of it was long enough and my unfamiliarity with Groovy made that a loosing attempt. All of these sensors integrate natively in Home Assistant without the need for trusting random third parties. In addition, it's much easier to write your own scripts and call them, see the logs, etc on Home Assistant, so I have written a few python scripts myself using this platform.

Home Assistant isn't all rosy, though. It's still relatively young and it's moving quickly. Some integrations do have breaking changes on occasion, but it's generally a small update to get things working again, and Home Assistant is good about marking things as breaking - just take a quick glance at the release notes. It does occasionally stop talking to one of my z-wave devices that is outside, but I think I solved that with a properly placed repeater. Sometimes when I restart it will not connect to my Hue hub so my lighting automation won't work. I just have to restart again and everything works.

It did take me a while to understand some of the concepts and get comfortable with making all of my automations and everything, but a few months in (while also working full time and in the process of moving, installing new sensors, etc) I got to a point where my wife and I can go through a day without every touching a light switch in our house and the lights do the right thing automatically. We get notifications when doors are left open (my wife loves leaving the garage door open...) and we get notifications based on the weather outside and the temperature inside on when we should open/close specific windows. I'm definitely happy I made the switch. At the time I moved I thought SmartThings was doing everything I wanted - and it was to a certain extent, but that was with paying for access to ActionTiles, and Rboy apps as well as writing a bunch of clunky stuff in CORE to get things just the way I wanted them. The first time I pressed a button on my phone and didn't have to wait a second before the light came on was magical.",1572463571,f5ts7ev,t3_dp91sf,t3_dp91sf,/r/homeautomation/comments/dp91sf/does_home_assistant_have_anything_like/f5ts7ev/,1,homeautomation
allenytsai,"Hello OP. Sounds like you've already invested in the Google ecosystem. The smarthome landscape is still largely fragmented, with the big guys (Google, Amazon, Apple, etc) still carving our their own ecosystem fiefdoms. This probably stifles innovation to a certain extend, but if you've already got your google home and mini, Google probably already has a good profile on your usage from your interaction with their platform. For that reason, if you're looking for a thermostat, the Nest could be a logical option. They have also introduced a home security system that you can look into, as well as a variety of smart cameras. The good thing is you can control them all from one app. People complain about the inconvenient of having like three different apps to check different gadgets, and that gets super annoying after a while. I personally use Alexa for my voice products, but I too have several Google Home/Nest products, but use Vivint for security because I signed up with them well before Google launched all these products.

neminat,"Crestron is very expensive but very nice.  It also does require a technician every time you want to add or change something.  I also think your point is valid about it being aged quickly.  Cheaper consumer grade devices can much more easily be replaced.  

Hub - you will need a hub for your setup.  Dont use just wifi devices on Alexa or the google assistant.  You will be very dissapointed.  Home Assistant requires a lot of setup, difficult configuration, and maintenance.  If you were inclined to do it on your own, i dont think you would look at Crestron and that expense first.  With that said, i would recommend the SmartThings platform.  

Audio - household audio that is fully smart controllable is not easily accomplished with anything other than a sonos setup.  This is easily attainable in your budget.    


Curtains - these are a bit of a pain.  Most of them are wifi controlled and if i were looking for a consumer level product to control these, i would want them smartthings compatible personally.  I would do some searching to see if there are any that are.  

Security is easy.  If you have wired alarm components now, grab a Konnected panel (and some add ons if needed) and integrate it into SmartThings.  Pretty darn easy.  If not, just purchase SmartThings compatible door / window sensors, a siren, etc.  You can use a tablet in a very nice wall frame (Etsy) that looks great on the wall and is a SmartThings dashboard and controls the keypad for the alarm.  I love mine.      


The smart lighting and temperature control are pretty easy.  Go with smart switches over bulbs where possible.  These can also be scene controllers (Inovellis new smart switches) which is awesome.

webdes03,"IMO, IFTTT isn’t responsive enough for home automation. You’d be much better off getting into an ecosystem and building your rules there. There’s tons to pick from, I went the Smartthings route because creating their device types is super simple so if you’re somewhat technically literate you can build your own device types for devices that aren’t officially supported. Take a look at webCORE, which is a super powerful open source rules engine that works with Smartthings. Picture IFTTT on steroids.

In terms of house building, run Cat5e/6 anywhere you think you might ever need it. Including security cameras, sensors, etc. The big advantage there is POE. Sure most things will run on Zigbee, Zwave or Wi-Fi protocols, but there’s nothing worse than farting around with batteries. I ran 37 runs in a 3200 sqft house, and about 30 of them are in use between home automation, devices like TVs, security cameras, audio keypads, sensors, etc. I’ve got 5 or 6 that are just there to grab POE and aren’t even used to transmit data.

In terms of actual power consumption, I had the same vision as you at first and quickly realized it was a bit of a waste once I got into it. 90% of our lights are LEDs, so tracking power consumption of say 10 recessed cans in the kitchen is pointless when they draw so little power. My advice there, unless you’re super anal and just have to have all the data, is to just focus on the big things like the fridge, furnaces, ac units, etc. don’t waste the money buying energy monitoring switches for all your lights, just get on/off/dimmer switches so you can set state.

I somehow missed leak detection in my plan so had to retrofit after our house was built. I’ll mention it just to make sure you don’t make the same mistake. I would have loved to have a smart shutoff to measure flow and give an automated way to shut off the water when I’m not home, but that was a bit too much work to add after the fact. Consider leak sensors under every sink, the fridge, and in the furnace condensate pans if you have those high efficiency furnaces that condensate year round (ours have a risk of the condensate drains freezing which causes the runoff to back up and pool in the pans in the attic).

I just backed the Shine bathroom assistant on Indegogo, not so much for the cleaning but for the leak detection. We had a neighbor across the street with a three year old house. The shutoff of the master bath toilet failed and the toilet overflowed while they were on vacation, water went through the ceiling to the first floor and the entire downstairs had to be gutted and all of the hardwoods replaced. Watching them deal with that has given me a new appreciation for leak detection, especially since we travel a fair amount.",1572169969,f5efst7,t3_dnr04r,t3_dnr04r,/r/homeautomation/comments/dnr04r/what_is_the_best_way_to_build_a_new_house_for/f5efst7/,1,homeautomation

As you leave the bathroom, the lights turn themselves off and the light to the hallway and the kitchen turn on (based on your routine).  Your coffee is ready to take from the coffee maker and your music gently fills only the room you are in to prevent bothering your family.  As you finish your breakfast and put your dishes away, your refrigerator takes inventory of what you consumed and uploads it into your health tracker.  To keep you on schedule, you are reminded by your TTS assistant of the major items you need to bring with you as you leave, if your phone's bluetooth is detected in a room where you are not located, it will remind you to grab your phone.  As you head to the door (or a bit before on colder days), your car's remote start fires up the car, disarms the front door and unlocks it.  The house sees your bluetooth phone address exit through the front door when the door contact opens and closes, then sees your bluetooth phone address enter your car.  Your route to your first appointment of the day is automatically uploaded by your assistant into your car's navigation system, and your music playlist or channel continues where it left off as you left the house.  Your kitchen lights turn off, and your home phone forwards your calls to your cell phone.  As you pull out of your driveway the front door re-locks and the home/armed mode is set back to your alarm system to protect your family.

&amp;#x200B;

Later as the last person leaves your home, the system ensures your windows are closed and the blinds drawn, locks the doors, sets the away mode for your alarm system, and changes the setpoint of your thermostat to reflect the home is unoccupied, but keeps track of humidity and air changes to avoid wear and tear on your home's structure and your possessions, and keep VOCs down.  Your water heater is allowed to coast down to a lower temperature to save energy.  Your WiFi is shut off so that it's not an attractive nuisance, and all of the phone ringers are muted so that a caller can't hear the phone not being picked up (all calls are routed to your mobile anyway). As anyone approaches your home who is not your family, the CCTV cameras on the outside will recognize that the person is a mailman, delivery driver, or some other authorized presence (like a utility meter reader) - based on pattern recognition of the person's movements and direction of travel on the property.  If the person  begins looking in windows or trying doors, the video feed is sent to your alarm company for visual verification, and if needed they contact you and dispatch the necessary officials.  As everyone is out of the house, roombas (vacuums and mops) are going around cleaning everything

&amp;#x200B;

As dusk sets in, your home's exterior security (landscaping) lights slowly ramp up to maintain a minimum illumination for your CCTV cameras and your neighbors to be able to see around your property.

&amp;#x200B;

As your day comes to a close, you get in your car, and your home is notified that you are on the way back based on your patterns.  Your ETA is tracked and your home gauges home much time is needed to bring the home back up to occupied environmental conditions.  Your water heater ramps up, hot water is circulated, and the HVAC system brings the temperature back up or down to an efficient point based on outdoor reset.  As your car is detected pulling into your driveway, your exterior lights come up to a welcome mode.  As you exit your vehicle, the alarm system changes only the front door to disarmed, unlocks the door, and turns on your entry lights.  As you walk through the front door, your home announces a status of the exterior and room motion detectors ""Yard and rooms all clear, would you care to disarm the home?""  You reply ""Yes"" and it sets the security system to off, and your phone calls are routed to your home phone so that you can put your phone on the charger and leave it alone.  As you walk towards each room the lights ramp up and your music follows you, with the lights and music slowly dimming out as you leave each room.  As the rest of your family heads home, your assistant gives and ETA so that you can prepare a dinner.  Based on what your system's inventory of your food knows you have, it makes a recommendation on what to make in the time allotted - you make a selection verbally.  As you walk into the kitchen to make dinner, your over preheats to the correct temperature for the recipe you've selected and the recipe is displayed on the counter where you will prepare your food.  As you measure out each ingredient needed, the assistant listens and checks off each ingredient, and highlights your next steps.  As you finish the preparation, the system detects that you've opened the oven, and that you've inserted a dish with the weight of the recipe, and as your close the oven door, the system announces it has begun the timer for you.  As the rest of your family get home their phone calls are routed to the home phones.  You get to talk with your wife and family as they do their homework and make plans for the rest of the week.  Your system tells you when it's time to set the table, so that when you are finished, the cooking will be done and it'll be ready to plate.  As you sit down to dinner, the system inventories that the phones are on their charging cradles in their respective owner's rooms, and the home phone is put into screening mode, while the WiFi is throttled or turned off.  As you finish eating, the hot water is again circulated so that it's ready for cleanup.  As your children's bedtimes approach, their rooms are warmed up to promote sleep, and over &gt;15 minutes the color temperature of your lights shift to a warmer white.  As your children get into bed, the temperature in their rooms begins a slow hour-long ramp to a lower temperature.  As you shuffle off to your room for the evening, the exterior doors are again locked, the blinds are drawn closed, and the alarm sets itself to a home/armed.  The lights in the unoccupied rooms fade to off, and the nightlights to the floor gently illuminate the major walkways.  Your closet and bathroom lights ramp up so that you can get ready for bed, you are asked by your assistant if there are any last minute reminders you need to set which you do verbally and verify on your smart mirror.  As you walk into your room from the bathroom, the bathroom lights fade to off, and the water heater settles in for the night.  As you get into bed, the lights slowly dim and become more yellow, targeting an ""off-time"" of at least 8 hours before your next wake alarm is set.  Your home phones is set to screening mode again, with automatic ring-through if it's a family or know urgent number, your WiFi is again throttled or turned off to encourage kids to sleep.  You fall asleep, having not had to touch a single remote control or push a button on or look at the status of a wall controller all day, and everything operated as if your home ""knew you like an old friend"".  As you sleep, roombas quietly go around the rooms with high foot traffic from when you and your family were awake to prepare for another busy day.",1572106911,f5aggea,t3_dnfogs,t3_dnfogs,/r/homeautomation/comments/dnfogs/brainstorming_of_your_wildest_home_automation/f5aggea/,1,homeautomation

winelight,"Well in general (leaving security on one side for the moment) this is how you can do it.

To view the dashboard presumably you need to reference the network address of the raspberry pi, probably by IP number on the local LAN. Say it's 192.168.1.99 for example. Oh and for the sake of argument you use HTTP on the default port of 80.

Now let's say your real WAN IP address given by your ISP is 1.2.3.4

From elsewhere on the Internet you can access your router by using 1.2.3.4 but of course your router's firewall will block any further access.

You go to your router control panel and set up port forwarding for example:

Port 50000 maps to port 80 on 192.168.1.99 for TCP

Then, if you run the dashboard remotely and specify 1.2.3.4:50000 as the address of the temperature sensor, this will get mapped by the router to your pi.

Now, your IP address will change from time to time. So you next need a dynamic DNS account. Then instead of using 1. 2.3.4 you will use your.personaldns.net.

Then you need something somewhere on your home network that will dynamically update the DNS when your WAN IP address changes.

Setting the cameras to ""streaming only"" then having one without a camera acting as an NVR will take most of the CPU load off the cameras as the NVR will be responsible for motion detection, then the main limitation will be your network speed, I'd recommend a 3b or higher (if not an actual PC) for the NVR, and not using wireless. The trade off is if the NVR loses power or fails in some other way the system will stop recording, and added cost. 

Of course lowering the resolution on the individual cameras, IMO for security purposes as long as faces can be made out, you're fine. I use 800x600 and can clearly see faces in the recordings. 

Setting up a motion detection mask, this will reduce the areas of the image the pi or NVR has to prosess to detect motion.

Secondly, it can be a nuisance when you have both a phone with assistant and a google home in the same room. They've programmed it to prioritise the google home, which makes good sense since ""hey google turn off the light"" has different meaning to a phone that doesn't know what room it is in and a speaker that does. BUT I always have my phone in flight mode at night, and consequently every time I ask the google home in my room anything I get my stupid phone robotically saying ""Your phone is in flight mode so I can't help you right now"" because, in flight mode, it doesn't get the message that another device heard your request. And then, after that, the screen stays on, sometimes forever.

Thirdly, it's just not as fast. Maybe it's because I have a gen 1 pixel.

You are supporting people's ignorance when in fact security risks are inevitable with any network device (computer, iot device, etc.) and people who use them should understand how to protect themselves.

I_Arman,"First off, talk to a plumber about winterizing the house. That involves draining the water lines, and draining then blocking sewage lines (like the u-bends in toilets and sinks). That will prevent any water problems like pipes freezing.

Do a winterizing yourself, as well, removing any liquids that could freeze, or other things that could be damaged by cold (LCDs, TVs and computer equipment, etc.). Then, turn off the gas/heat, and probably most of the breakers.

Contact the post office and ask for a full mail stop or redirect to your address. Full stop on the newspaper, too.

If possible, enlist the help of a neighbor to watch the house - you may even offer to pay someone to check up on it once a week or so.

For a security system, you'll want something with stick-on wireless motion sensors and window/door sensors. Motion will probably be a better bang for the buck; door sensors on entrances, motion for big rooms. *Don't* get something with a contract, obviously. With DSL, you should be able to get something that works over an existing internet connection - no need for a cell-based system.

A lot of people will suggest hubs, and that's not a bad option, but one that I have found can be overwhelming for someone in your position. I would therefore be inclined to point you in the direction of ecosystem solutions that you can build on in the future. 

For security, Nest offer both a doorbell, cameras, a deadbolt and an alarm system. You can pair these systems with Google Nest smart speakers, displays and Chromecast devices which will then allow you to open and close locks, arm and disarm the security system and also view the cameras on your displays / TV. 

An alternative would be Ring, they offer cameras, doorbells and alarms and the alarm hub can also work with a number of smart locks on the market. Again, pairing these devices with Echo devices and Fire TV's will allow voice control and viewing of camera feeds.

They're good for isolation, but if implemented improperly, can be compromised by a knowledgeable attacker who could potentially jump their traffic between VLANs and use that to push a compromise across a VLAN barrier.  To move from VLANs for isolation to VLANs for security, you need a firewall between your VLANs to make sure you're passing only the traffic you want between devices that need to talk and all other traffic is shitcanned.  As usual, however, your security should not begin and end with a firewall and VLANs. 

Wherever possible, host-based firewalls should also be similarly configured to surgically allow/disallow traffic between hosts on the same VLAN (not routed so doesn't pass the firewall) and to provide backup to the firewall config that passes traffic between hosts on different VLANs.

ImaginaryCheetah,"i know nothing about HA using PI or other smart systems, but i know a lot about security.

almost every off-the-shelf motion detector has built-in form-C relays.

meaning, you provide the motion detector 12v (typically) and it will autonomously fire the relay based on whether it detects motion. then you can monitor that contact state w/your home automation of choice.

most motion detectors are Passive IR (PIR), and can be had for $20-$100 depending on how robust a model you need, or the features you want.

the thing to consider is that motion detection requires motion to stay in an active state. meaning, unless you have bodies moving in the space, the speakers will time out after the latching interval on the motion detection expires.

*room occupancy* sensors are dual systems that use PIR and microwave reflection to do a better job of sensing a stationary occupant. they are more spendy, usually north of $100 per unit, but do a much better job compared to a simple PIR.

Even if your native VLAN is elsewhere, an enthusiastic attacker could extremely easily sweep VLANs instead of just shooting at vlan 1, (as you said, you dont get feedback either way) and it's sort of security through obscurity to say vlan 1 is the danger zone.

warlordav,"I backed their Kickstarter a while back for their cameras.  I thought the facial recognition stuff they were doing seemed interesting.  In practice, it doesn't work super well.  That said, the camera quality is really nice.  The batteries don't last 365 days for me without charging, however, they last a REALLY long time.  I'd say I get at least 6 months on a charge.  We had temperatures down to around -15 last year and they still worked fine.  Storage is local, but I can stream live and view recordings remotely.  Probably the biggest negative is the lack of integrations into other home automation systems.  Most support Nest, Arlo, etc. only.

[Vlan hopping attack](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/security-essentials/vlan-hopping-and-mitigation).  Granted, it's not really all *that* likely of an attack vector. But if you've already gone through all the bother of vlan'ing things off, it's basically ten seconds more and then you're effectively immune.

Protecting against vlan hopping is like locking second story windows...  if your front door is unlocked then they're never going to get to the second story. But if you've locked all the windows and doors on the first floor, someone might try the second story window. It only takes a second to lock your upper windows, like it only takes a second to ditch vlan 1.  It's just good network hygene when dealing with vlans.

UnreasonableSteve,"Hidden SSID is generally considered just an inconvenience for normal users. Anyone scanning for anything is going to see it regardless. 

Guest network client isolation is good practice, and at a basic level you're reasonably ""secure"" for a normal home, but I'd make some changes for my own paranoia and for interoperability. 

Having two completely separate networks is great for isolation but complete isolation may not be what you want. Maintaining the two networks as separate VLANs within the realm of a single firewall lets you easily punch holes between the networks for things that need to be connected while keeping them separated in all other ways. This also lets you use your more powerful firewall[s] for both networks, instead of a relatively weak firewall in front of the IoT network

I personally prefer a whitelist approach for my IoT devices - this takes significantly more work but results in some significant security benefits. Right now, the wifi network sounds like it lets a guest go anywhere they want online. Imagine a rogue IoT device that has somehow been compromised and is now reporting all conversations it can hear (or video it can see, or whatever other sensors it may have) to a new IP in Russia. Would you be notified? With outbound whitelisting, you could prevent such a thing from happening (and in my case, I block almost all outbound traffic from my IoT network, since I don't tend to use cloud services and I don't trust them much).

Xpawn70,"Sorry for a long answer.. tl;dr: choose a hub

My 2 cents is that hubs often offer better automation-features, and a single point of configuration and mostly no direct need for an internet connection (other than updates, connecting to assistants, remote control from outside the LAN).

Wifi-devices, unless buying the same brand bulb/outlet/whatever, demands it's own app, and an internet connection to do it's job, plus the cheap Chinese bulbs often drop their app from the app store after a relatively short time, so you are SOL if you move, change router, etc (You can always try to flash Tasmota or similar, to get everything under 1 app)

And, like other commenters her said, security is non-existent on wifi-devices. They have full access on your wifi/lan

Distance is another factor, since wifi has a (relatively) limited range, but Zigbee/Z-wave builds their own mesh network that, with some planning, can extend much further than just wifi alone. More zigbee/z-wave devices means a stronger network mesh

WiFi congestion has been mentioned, if many devices try to send data at the same time

(Mesh network means all devices talk to all neighboring devices, and will not break even if some devices are removed, and all devices act as routers, cooperating to get the signal to where it should go)

And I think the hubs are relatively cheap for what you get. You can always buy a used hub on eBay or something, just to try

For me, I really appreciate the single point for configuration (and app), plus no real need for internet connection and not having to worry about which brand/vendor I buy, since: If it's zigbee it will work (I have 2 Zigbee hubs plus a CC2531 USB stick that works as a Zigbee hub, a TellStick 433Mhz hub and some other stuff. I have yet to come across a single device that will NOT pair with the CC2531 (especially useful in conjunction with Home Assistant or OpenHAB)

It is your choice, really, but hubs will give you much more control over automations that you can not get from wifi-devices.

* Wifi devices typically are not mesh based. Z-Wave and Zigbee are.

YaztromoX,"Congestion can be an issue, but the bigger issue (IMO) is one of security.  Each and every WiFi device is completely addressable on your LAN by any other device.  Many of them lack any sort of encryption or authentication.  Nearly _all_ of them (unless you go with some of the fancier Apple Homekit stuff) are cheaply made, with cheap software that is developed more as an afterthought and are full of security holes.

Because of all of the, if someone connects to your network they have access to all of your devices.  If someone slips some malware onto a machine on your network (and it may not even be _your_ machine; it could be a guest system you've granted access to your (non-guest) WiFi), they have access to all your devices.  And some of the devices are so insecure that an attacker could update their firmware without your knowledge, and then use them for things like DDoS attacks.

I have a zero WiFi device policy for smart plugs, switches, locks, sensors, and lights.

Run Cat6 wire for wireless access points - you will use these regardless. 
If you might want whole home audio in the future (Heos or Sonos pre amp or matrix) - run 14/2 speaker wire for left and right  channels in various rooms, maybe two runs over a master shower as well. Consider running wire to the exterior even if you just put it in a box to splice into later.

Run cat6 to 3 of 4 walls to a potential office.

Run 3 cat6 wires to each area a wall mounted TV would go. If you can spare the cost, make one cat6 wire shielded cat6.

Run security alarm wire to at least the door frames for entry points (exterior, including garage) 22/2 or 22/4 stranded

All the actual criminal needs to do is follow some instructions, type in a couple variables and click “go”.  A couple weeks of training videos and some free software and congrats, you’re a “hacker”.  Hell, the cybercrime rings that market this shit on the dark web have tech support these days.  Think of it like “Hacking as a Service (HaaS)”

I spend a fair amount of time in the dark web forums where these kids of things are bought and sold watching out for the next big threat and I can promise you, I’m not just pulling this out of my ass.

I have a smart thermostat so that I can adjust the temp from bed or adjust the schedule while traveling. I’ve got lights setup so that I can make it look like I’m home, or just simply turn things on or off based on specific conditions. 

Sure, all my iot stuff is on a different vlan with strict acl, but I’m a network nerd first and foremost... I’ve got to find some reason to justify the thousands of dollars of lab equipment and training I’ve gone through. 

Would I recommend if you’re going to automate to segment the iot stuff to its own guest network, yeah I would. At the same time, I can see that technology can be a net positive regardless of the risk. I’m honestly more concerned with a refrigerator becoming part of a botnet than someone breaking in. 

I mean, if you want to go deep down the rabbit hole of security, go ahead and lock your garage door manually and disconnect it from the opener, because you can hack rolling garage door codes easier than most smart locks.",1570589814,f320jnp,t3_df7gec,t1_f31yvba,/r/homeautomation/comments/df7gec/why_is_that_is_it_really_so_easy_to_hack_in_or/f320jnp/,1,homeautomation
tehnoodles,"&gt; the smart lock is more of a risk than the glass window next to the front door.

I work in IT as a network engineer, and when we get into the discussion of HA (High-Availablity in that context) I always find myself reminding people that yes, we need redundancy and security, yes there are scenarios that test the limits, but if the scenario you describe were to happen, we have much bigger issues.

Most recently it was ""but if the CSZ (cascadia subduction zone... scary shit) collapses, this fiber fails and access to this data goes down."" Yes, that's correct, and noone will give a shit because seattle will be under 10 feet of tidal swell.

Teeklin,"&gt;It's not insane to assume that software has bugs, and it's not an argument that a software lock has more potential faults than a hardware lock.

It isn't insane on either count.  But it's like saying there's a greater chance of seeing a unicorn than a leprechaun. 

&gt; If you want to put the culmination of your entire working life and the safety of your family behind some CNET-tier IOT device then go for it but it just doesn't make sense to me.

The dumb deadbolt on my front door right now is Kwikset.  I am trusting them when they say their lock is secure and isn't going to just open to any key or open randomly on its own or jiggle loose or easily come apart.  If I'm willing to trust them with that lock, why would I not also be willing to trust them when they say their Kevo lock is just as secure?

Furthermore, in some situations it's MORE secure.  If I'm not home and someone breaks into my house I have no clue until I get back.  If I have a smart lock I get an alert when it breaks or becomes unlocked and know right then and there.  I also don't have to worry about accidentally forgetting to lock the house when I leave or go to sleep.

TerawattX,"As a developer though, how much do you trust other people’s code?  Especially when it might be an understaffed/over-worked team.

My main concern is the quality of code by the manufacturer.  There was a study showing that most Z Wave devices (or ZigBee maybe) hardly even had bare minimum security in place - and you know most of those aren’t getting patched since they’re generic switches or bulbs.  Since those protocols act as a mesh network you could theoretically find an insecure light bulb or whatever and use it to relay commands to unlock a deadbolt.

As for the big names like Amazon and Google, they almost certainly do a better job on that front, but then you have to worry about what’s done with the data they collect.

SpartEng76,"Well, here's what my wish list looks like so far:

Hub: Thinking about Hubitat as a Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant is a little intimidating.  I like a little bit of a challenge but I don't want to rip my hair out.  I definitely need Z-wave but all I use right now is wifi.  ($80)

Bedroom: Haven't quite figured out the logistics, but maybe some motion sensed under-bed night lights (??), smart blinds that open in the morning and close in the evening ($160 ea), Bond smart ceiling fan ($85), and to somehow control my reading lamps more easily (??).  

Bathroom:  Some sort of tablet that can play music, tell us the weather and what we have planned for the day, and can show us any security videos, etc. (dashboard?).  Maybe an Echo show or something similar ($150-230).  Bathroom fans that automatically shut off ($40 ea), and maybe automate the lights and add dimmers so they are not so bright first thing in the morning or in the middle of the night (??).  

Garage door: Set it to automatically close at a certain time if it is left open.  Probably just need a MyQ ($49).

Pond: It's too far away for wifi, but I think z-wave would work since it has a longer range.  So once I get a compatible hub I'll need an outdoor smart plug ($40) and maybe a range extender ($30). It would really up the ""wow"" factor if I could turn it on via voice or app.  

TV:  would be nice to use Google or Alexa to turn on the TV and tell it to watch something on Netflix.  I believe I would need a compatible smart tv, I want a bigger tv anyway, probably a 50-55"" Samsung ($400-500).

Lighting: This is where it gets complicated. I'd probably just replace all of my switches with smart ones, not sure about zigbee or zwave. I want to keep dumb functionality but also have full control to automate ($25 ea).  

Modes: I'd like to set up different scenes or modes like Sleep mode, Away mode, TV mode, etc.  Like during sleep mode the lights would all turn off, the garage door will close, the TV will turn off, etc. 

Security: I'd like a smart doorbell but I'm not interested in paying a monthly fee for anything.  Possibly 3 Wyze cams ($26 ea) on the front porch, driveway, and back porch that are triggered by motion. I also want real time video.  I'd have sensors on the main doors and windows ($30 ea), if the house is in Away mode and a sensor gets tripped I get alerted and will have a couple more cams inside.  

Other: Smart smoke/CO detectors in every room, probably First Alert ($38 ea).  I want to get notified if it senses smoke or CO and I'm not home.  Also a smart leak detector in my basement since my sewer has backed up before and I'd really like to avoid that happening again.  

Power saving: I'm not big on too many motion sensors because I feel like they just drain energy.  I'd like to tell lights and certain devices to shut off during away mode to not waste energy.  I want to automate my lights as well as I can but not use a ton of extra energy. 

HVAC: Coordinate my thermostat, window and door sensors, and smart blinds.  So mainly it knows when the windows are open and it doesn't turn on the AC or furnace. 

I'd also like some sort of dashboard for the kitchen/living room area.  It can be attached to the all and removable and maybe just docked on a counter.

jrob801,"Real estate agent with significant experience in new construction here:  


With regard to new buildings, I always advise my clients to spend upgrade money inside your walls. Those things are costly and hard to change/upgrade later.   


* Spend money on the best insulation. 
* Spend on extra outlets everywhere. You always want more and need them in places where code doesn't require them (for example, I have none in my main hallway, the logical place to plug in a vacuum).
* Talk to your electrician about electrical diagrams to ensure your breakers are set up how you want them. I'd recommend putting a room's light and outlets on different circuits (means you don't have to work without light if you're fixing something in a particular room), and I'd recommend a breaker for each room, generally speaking. 
* Internet/Cable TV wiring everywhere, even places you think are useless. I didn't wire my formal dining room... Guess what? It's an office now. Whoops. If possible, run ethernet in conduit, at least to a place where you can finish upgrade runs easily. It's likely that you'll want to upgrade that wiring significantly before other stuff that's in the walls. 
* Even if the ROI isn't there, prewire for solar. That ROI can change quickly. In the last 10 years, my power bill has gone from one where there would be no ROI to one with a 6 year payback (coupled with an electric car using the cost savings vs gas). At a minimum, make sure your main breaker panel at the meter can support a solar breaker. Quite often, builders put a box with ONLY a main breaker at the meter, with everything else being on a subpanel inside the house. This will complicate solar in the future if you ever make that choice. 
* Prewire for security cameras. Sure, there are wireless options, and they're decent, but they still can't compare to a wired, POE system at present. Additionally, they require either batteries (maintenance and effort to change) or power (more wiring). Again, things can change fast, so you might as well prepare for it. You don't control whether or not a junkie moves in next door. 
* Think about zoned HVAC. You want different areas of your house to be heated/cooled differently. If your house isn't big enough for multiple furnaces/AC units, zoning is a great idea. 
* If you're building with an unfinished basement, think about how that basement will lay out later. Builders are infamous for putting HVAC/Water heaters/Electrical panels in the location that's easiest for them, but it often totally screws up the flow of the basement down the road. Today, you can put those things anywhere you want them (if you install high efficiency equipment), and not have to wrestle with how to overcome their stupid decisions down the road. 

In general, look at it like this: Infrastructure is more important than finish. If you have to forego quartz counters or the beautiful light fixtures you want in order to get things right in your walls, do it. It's easy to change a countertop. It's not easy to correct an overloaded circuit. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for Smarthome related products, most of them are easy add-ons. I'd have the builder do a few, like Smart thermostat, a smart water valve, sprinkler controller, and door locks. Smart light switches and a few smart outlets are a decent idea as well. 

I think Smarthome tech is right on the line between being a hobbiest realm and ready for primetime. Basic home control is absolutely ready for prime time, and there's a lot of benefit to being able to control your lights by voice, setting up basic routines, etc. The learning curve for these things is quite small (an hour or so of figuring it out, and maybe a couple more hours to set up the basic things you want it to do)

In my house, I have smart lighting everywhere. Smart switches control overhead lights, smart outlets control lamps. I have a ton of basic automations that make my life much easier and are way more foolproof than non-smart alternatives (such as turning on outside lights from dusk-dawn). I have routines enabled that make things like going to bed and leaving the house much simpler (shut off all the overhead lights, lock the doors , adjust the thermostat, and make sure the garage is closed at bedtime, for example). None of this stuff required a significant learning curve. 

It becomes a hobbiest realm when you want to do serious/complex automation, like having lights turn on, security system disable,  doors unlock, and garage door open when you pull into the driveway. It's likely to stay this way for a while still, because everyone's desires are different, and because some of the supporting technology (like geolocation) isn't perfect yet. A lot of that tech hasn't been looked at with smarthomes in mind. However, that can change easily. For example, navigate home with Google maps/Waze/Apple maps and those apps communicate with your home hub to tell it you're on your way home. When you arrive, what you want to happen, happens. That'd work a lot better than requiring on your phone's GPS to watch for you to be within a certain geo-location that may or may not mean you're actually going home. 

Ultimately, I'd say Smart Home technology is ready for primetime. Anything can become a hobbiest realm when you're looking to take it's capabilities beyond what corporate interests have deemed appropriate. If you want your house to be more easily controlled, Smarthome tech is there. If you want to live in the Jetson's universe, it's not. Just like the Automotive industry has arrived at a place where if you want to go from A to B reliably, it's there.

If you plan to live in the house for a while maybe a media panel behind where the TV's will be, and maybe PVC pipe to the ceiling (projector) or pre-wire for sound.

A non-cloud based thermostat that can use remote temp sensors. I did it with a zwave thermostat but ecobee is also a good choice.

A prosumer security system that can use any monitoring service (e.g. elk m1, dsc power) and with an ethernet card. These can interact with the upper tier of HA systems and are solid systems without the ADT surcharge. Some can support zwave devices.

Keypad locks. Mine are zwave and can be programmed from the controller but they can be programmed at the keypad just as well. Zwave locks plus a door sensor (possibly on the security system) can relock themselves. I think some newer august locks have a door-close sensor built in.

I like smart lighting on the exterior, bedrooms and key hallways. Exterior to go along with any alarms, bedrooms for wakeup alarms, hallways during fire/tornado emergencies.

I have them in all my bathrooms, closets, and hallways, pantry, and garage. Because they are also smart, I use them as security as well so they trigger warnings when I’m not home or when the house is in sleep mode and motion is detected. I also have one on my kitchen switch that doesn’t turn on the actual kitchen switch when motion is detected but instead triggers the under cabinet lighting to come on because I want it to come on at all times of the day (I don’t need the actual kitchen lights on except when it gets darker, and I can use voice commands or manual switch it on). In the previous case, it’s much nicer to have the motion detector on the switch where is receives constant power (not battery operated), and I don’t have to mount it or hide wires anywhere. Also typically can have an immediate reset time. Most battery operated motion sensors have a minute or more reset time to conserve battery life.

I_Arman,"It's not a problem per se; Wi-Fi switches are not as reliable, stable, or efficient as Z-Wave. With Wi-Fi, the more devices you get, the more congested your network - and most of those switches and bulbs are going to be controlled by various apps, usually with servers in China. There are already cases of Wi-Fi bulbs and switches being hacked and used in bot-nets.

Z-Wave's problem is that 90% of the world thinks ""smart"" means ""I can tell Alexa to turn it on"", and are content with one or two devices. In that case, Wi-Fi wins. It's only when you want automation, security, and reliability that Z-Wave wins out, and most people don't even realize that is an option.

That said, if you want cheap, go with wired. You can get a latching single pole/double throw relay module for $13 on Amazon right now; run power + signal + ground to it, and you're done.

nstuyvesant,"I bought a house with RadioRA 2 and Control4 (the latter is used for contact closure inputs). If I were designing the system I have today from scratch, I would have chosen HomeWorks QS over RadioRA 2 (though I'm very happy with RadioRA 2).

The main differentiator in my case would be that I would not have needed the Control4 system. My house has 15 Victorian-style push button light switches that are actually low-voltage contact closures. These are wired to 2 x Control4 IO Extenders attached to my Control4 Home Controller (HC-300). When I press a button, it runs a Control4 scene that sets Lutron RadioRA 2 dimmers and switches. While it all works, there is a noticeable delay when pressing buttons (sometimes as much as 3-4 seconds).

Why have Control4 at all (if I'm not using any of its AV capabilities)? Because RadioRA 2 has minimal contact closure interfaces. There are 2 Contact Closure Inputs on each Visor Control (plus one for security). I'd need 8 x Visor Controls to handle the 15 Contact Closure Inputs. Sadly, there was a nice Contact Closure Interface for RadioRA Classic (RA-SCI) but it doesn't work with RadioRA 2.

If I had HomeWorks QS, I could add 2 x QS Wallbox Closure Interfaces (QSE-CI-WCI) and eliminate the Control4 system and associated lag.

2. Blinds, Vacuum cleaners, coffeemaker, humidifies, ovens, refrigerators, washer, dryer, toilet, air purifier, tv's, projectors, HVAC systems, etc, etc, etc and that's not even getting into IoT devices designed for automation like motion sensors or door sensors.
3. A smart thermostat is a pretty good place to begin. I have well over a hundred IoT devices in my ecosystem.

As BreakfastBeerz said. You'll want to figure out your end goal and buy products to support it.

My setup is designed around connected devices and automation. So things like my z wave light switches pair with my motion sensors to automate lights. I'm also using connected devices like a Google home in the living room that runs a routine when I inform it that ""It's living room move time""That one command.

* Lowers my 100"" home theater screen
* Turns on my 3D DLP projector
* Turns on my wireless surround sound system
* sets the thermostat to 72\*
* Sets my home security system to home mode
* Dims the overhead lights to 1%
* Turns off my dining room lights.
* Closes both window blindes in the living room.

When I inform my google home that ""Living Room movie time is over""

That one command

* Raises the home theater screen
* turns off the projector
* sets the lights to 100%
* turns on my dining room lights
* opens my blinds back up

Google routines aren't really true automation in my opinion. My end goal is to get it so my house can understand who is home, what I'm doing, what i want to do, and modify its self to best suit me, all without my verbal or physical input.

You'll want to be sure you know exactly what you want before you start buying different products.

* Smart sprinklers (Racchio) - Definitely well worth it.  My sprinkler controller is located in my basement so whenever I wanted to test something I had to constantly run up and down the stairs.  It was also a pain to program and it I didn't watch it, it would water right after it rained.  This will definitely pay for itself in water savings and has my grass looking much better.
* Smart Plug #1 - Foyer light - This one is well worth it.  I basically have it programmed to come on when I wake up in the morning, and turn off when we leave or the sun comes out.  At night it comes on at sunset and goes off at bedtime. Huge boost in convenience since the switch wasn't that easy to access and I never have to worry about it.
* Smart Plug #2 - Phone charger - Worth it.  This one I basically have programmed to shut off before my phone is fully charged since chargers drain a little energy and it's supposed to be bad for your phone if you fully charge it. It should save a bit of energy and increase the life of my phone.
* Other smart plugs - not worth it just because it was easier to use the switch to turn them on.
* Google Home Mini - I got it for free so I guess it's worth it.  I mainly just use it for a timer in the kitchen and to play music.  Sometimes we ask it questions, play games, or use it to control some lights.

Other than that, I have a lot of ideas but a lot of them would involve a decent amount of cost and work for a minimal increase in convenience, so I have a hard time trying to justify them.

**All security**, and I don't give a fuck who you think you are, comes down to the likelihood of attack, difficulty of protection, what you're protecting, and the fallout from failing to protect it.

Vuelhering,"&gt; There's a huuuuuge gap between someone that'd try a door and someone that'd smash a fucking window.

Has that been measured during a power outage? Because that's the only time your argument applies.

In other words, you're saying there's this huuuuuge gap, but that huuuuuge gap only applies ~0.01% of the time, depending where you live, depending on the power consistency, depending on missing a battery backup, depending on people actually approaching your house, and depending what lock you're using because you might have to pull out a key instead of rfid or punching in a code.

And most likely, if someone is a looter during a natural disaster (far more likely than simple temp power outage), their is nearly zero gap between someone that'd try a door and someone that'd also break a window to get in. It's kind of the definition of looter, instead of opportunistic sticky-fingered thief.

Basically, you're posing a very rare situation (power outage, looter trying your door, looter won't break window) and pretending it happens all the time, when in reality it probably almost never applies.

A huge part of security is looking at the odds and what you're protecting and what you're protecting against. You have an unrealistic view of this.",1569792544,f1x1ybk,t3_daug2x,t1_f1wawh1,/r/homeautomation/comments/daug2x/compact_lock_to_fit_this_door/f1x1ybk/,0,homeautomation

then you can use a cheap 433hz RF transmitter/receiver to get a remote monitoring of the garage door contact, and then a local relay inside your house.

msct-reddit,"I'm in the exact same boat and have some thoughts... I did this before on a greenfield build and also learned a few things (and some of this is open for debate):

1. As everyone already stated, everything is cheaper before drywall goes up. So for me, that means CAT6 \*everywhere\*. Home-run stuff to your preferred wiring closet, but put it to every room, even ceilings (future access points, occupancy sensors), outdoors under eaves (PoE security cameras), doorbell locations (smart doorbells), obvious offices and media areas. I did structured wiring previously (2 Cat 5e + 2 RG6) but I'd skip the coax and just do CAT6... the coax takes up space, is thicker wire, and I ended up not using it as much. That being said, there are still use cases where you might want some RG6 to the roof for external antennas, or certain TV/media boxes, and so forth; all I'm saying is I didn't need 2x coax at every point where I had Ethernet and it made working the cables a bit messy. Don't forget about garages, basements, utilities for water control, places you might want keypads, outdoor gates, possible camera locations, whatever...  Ethernet is cheap, you can use it for so many things, PoE is now super interesting, and so forth.
2. Make sure your wiring cabinet/closet has plenty of power as folks said. You'll probably want to power some PoE devices from there, so just be smart about stuff. You may want to run a fiber optic line from your outside access point too (if you have FiOS or other fiber providers), etc.
3. I'd strongly recommend wiring every exterior door and window with alarm teeth (hidden), and even consider wiring internal doors as well for future automation. This is super cheap if you do it early, and just wire it into a ""dumb"" old-school UL alarm system that you can make ""smart"" later through a bridge or whatever. I think the new ""smart"" alarm systems all suck, but maybe I'm not up-to-speed on everything? I'm planning on using an old school Honeywell Vista or Elk M1 (since folks know them so well).
4. Don't forget about wiring to shades if you're thinking about powered shades or other things like that...  yes there are battery options now, but you can keep your options open too. Again, cheap if you plan for it.
5. Generic HV wiring - I think you want neutrals to all switch boxes for maximum flexibility.
6. Speakers and other media - not sure what you're doing there, but you may want in-wall or in-ceiling speakers and so forth. This may be separate from your LV/networking, etc.

That's about all on my radar...  it's easy to go crazy (ask all the people who put in HDMI cables or Svideo or other obsolete crap) but I think Cat 6 is easy, cheap, and super versatile so the mantra = put it everywhere.

And of course +1 on the posts of putting in power/outlets everywhere...  esp. in wiring closets and media device ""clumps"".",1569518526,f1j48o8,t3_d98nfr,t3_d98nfr,/r/homeautomation/comments/d98nfr/new_home_construction_ownerbuilder/f1j48o8/,1,homeautomation

It also claims to have geo location that allows you to open the garage when you are near. This works about 40% of the time.

Using Alexa to close the garage is pretty easy. To open you need a pin code and it's a pain. I avoid opening the garage with Alexa.

Occasionally I will get notifications that the garage is open when its not open. I have to check my security cameras to verify door status when this happens. I have been meaning to check the sensors to see if they are aligned properly but I haven't so I am not sure if this is a glitch or if it's an alignment issue with the sensor.

ashzs,"A fully-feature complete DIY security system based on home automation sensors can be a bit of a rabbit hole depending on how far you want to go. 

Integration of door and motion sensors with a smart hub or controller is not too bad, but where I found things can get a bit more uncertain, again if you want to go this far, is a cost-effective way to replicate the ability of the typical security system to continue working in the face of both a power and internet outage (e.g. cellular modem and UPS; or a laptop with decent battery that has an integrated cellular modem; then add a cellular data plan on top of that). 

I found that, at least where I am, to buy everything brand new to achieve that last step of reliable cellular access and battery back-up is relatively expensive unless you already happen to have the equipment from other projects.

I personally built whole home security out of a Raspberry Pi and crazy cheap 433mhz motion sensors, door sensors etc. They are designed to be used with their own alarm products but it's trivial to get them to work with the Pi. It's all integrated into Home Assistant too which gives the additional advantage of having motion lights in every room in the house now for not much money!

Been running it for several months and been flawless so far. Yes there are flaws with using 433mhz but as long as you understand and accept them I think it's a great route to go.

For as long as the Harmony Hub is a supported product.  It's now a permanent, published, API.  This is different than it was before, which was an undocumented backdoor API.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They’ve done it once, and will do it again just like they did it with their previous product (harmony predecessor). They’ve remotely bricked it and told customers to buy the new one, but offered a small discount on new one if you gave them back the old one.

You speak of the Harmony Link, and there was no discount: they replaced every single one with a Harmony Hub.  Also, they didn't brick it, they just stopped supporting it, and once the security certificates expired it was game over.  That seems like splitting hairs, but one is an intentional act (Google does brick things), while what they did was simply do nothing.  


And all of these are potential problems with any IP controlled device that uses security, but so far Logitech's track record has been better than 90-95% of others in the space.  Certainly better than Google or Amazon.",1569330669,f1bc4ld,t3_d7uw87,t1_f1bbndv,/r/homeautomation/comments/d7uw87/one_remote_for_everything/f1bc4ld/,1,homeautomation
CoopNine,"I think the problem is not knowing how a firewall works, and oversimplifying things.  You can hear the term, but if you don't understand it, you make assumptions that are incorrect.  If I setup a firewall and don't allow any access my devices don't work properly for me.  If I poke holes and allow access, anyone with my credentials can access the device.  At this point the only thing my firewall is doing is preventing traffic to ports that are unnecessary for full normal operation of my device.  While this might still be a good thing if say a backdoor is found which allows access on an unexpected port, it does nothing to prevent someone from accessing the device in the same way I want to.

Security is complex.  It's a balanced (if done right) set of protections and risks.  There's no simple solution to 'just make it work' there are layers to it and it's only as strong as the weakest link.  In most cases that weakest link is your 'trusted' users.   Users don't want things to be hard, they just want them to work, and most importantly to be easy.  They don't want to enter their password for each session, let alone do 2FA.  

For anyone who knows anything about security, the idea that there should just be a wall or firewall and it would solve all the problems is a laughable prospect.  Yeah, why didn't we think of that!

The boss up there will definitely not allow it to market truthfully, similar to many products. Marketing deception. Else it will not sell. The car salesman is not gonna tell you what to lookout for when maintaining your vehicle, instead, he will tell you they've warranty and upsell you on car servicing agreement/contracts and support.

ImaginaryCheetah,"good evening,

\+18 years fire and security here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;First, since I’m connecting to a security system with sirens already in  place, is it typical to select smoke detectors without built in  sounders?  Looks like you can get them with or without.

you want local annunciation on your smoke detectors.

you might be mistaking heat detectors for the ones w/o local annunciation.

i would recommend heat detectors in areas prone to nuisance alarms - kitchen, attic, garage.

they will be 2 wire.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I’ve been looking at detector layouts throughout the house.

it's been a few years since i was residential, but i believe code is 1 per sleeping area, 1 per hallway servicing sleeping areas. everything else is optional. but check your local code for clarification. i highly recommend calling the planning department and asking who is the fire chief for your area, the fire department will love to recommend smoke detector placement. they are very interested in people having good smoke detection.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If using detectors without built in sounders, should detectors be  located differently and have the security system sirens near the  bedrooms?

i generally recommend adding a siren internal to the main return duct for your air conditioning, and as loud a siren as you can get for up in the attic, aimed out the soffit vent or peak vent. this distributes the alarm throughout the house, at a less than hellish volume. and wakes the neighborhood outside. try to avoid false alarms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I’ve seen smoke detectors with built in CO detection too.  
&gt;  
&gt;Should these  really be located in the same places that the smoke detectors are  supposed to be?  Is it better to keep them separate?

modern CO detectors are UL listed for placement at smoke detector height.

my own gut instinct is to keep them low to the ground, at outlet height. but we all depend on UL vetting equipment, so if the manufacturer states they will properly detect and alarm at ceiling height, you can believe it.

the need for CO detectors depends on a lot of variables. if you have an electric heat pump, and electric range, there's no gas emitting appliances in the house. if you have forced air with a gas furnace, then you need more CO detection. there should always be a CO detector on the interior of the door to the garage, if attached.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Any other bonus thoughts about 2 or 4 wire preference?

i prefer 2 wire, since modern alarm systems can reset the smokes. but there's no disadvantage for either, other than wire cost.

i would caution against tying your smoke detectors directly into a HA appliance, unless that appliance is listed for interconnection with fire detection.

better to have your alarm system fire some relays and then monitor those through the HA.

&amp;#x200B;

lightening damage generally doesn't occur from lightening striking your home or devices directly. nothing short of extensive direct-to-earth grounding offers any kind of protection against direct lightening strikes, and that kind of equipment is almost never installed for residential use. the only time i've seen direct-to-earth lightening mitigation is on farmhouse or other isolated structures that are the highest point for the area. 

if your home is single story, and there are trees near by, you are very very unlikely to need to mitigate direct lightening strikes. 

lightening damage almost always occurs from lightening hitting trees or power poles, and having that electricity jump to house wiring as it finds a path to ground. so your source of risk is not cameras into the home, but rather plugged in appliances leading out to the cameras. 

lightening surge can enter your network through the modem connection to the internet, or through phone lines if they punch down into your gear. 

you are advised to run any exterior coms cable through a surge protector before tying into the network.

jec6613,"If you're having WiFi disconnection issues, you should really look at the WAPs and not the devices.  99% of the time, it's a network configuration problem.  I found I had to limit the basic rates on 2.4 GHz to get a fully reliable connection for my 2.4 GHz devices, as well as disable any fast roaming features on my PSK SSID (most of my devices use 802.1x auth) to get reliable connectivity.

Since making those changes, I've had no drops or any performance issues on either my high speed dual band clients (laptops, tablets, phones) or on my 2.4 GHz low speed clients, even with 4 WAPs with full roaming.  Though it helps that every 5 GHz device supports 802.1x so it gets a bunch of help from the WAPs from band steering, 802.1x pre-auth, and 802.11r.

As far as security, properly configured WiFi is definitively more secure than Z-Wave or ZigBee.  Even with the WPA2 exploits, the encryption level is still higher, PFS is a common feature on any decent WAP, and 802.1x provides an enormous level of control over what devices can connect and talk to other devices.  Of course, properly configuring WiFi does require knowledge, and in my case is helped by using all managed switches including an L3 core.",1568828765,f0p7d18,t3_d5wbsi,t1_f0oco2j,/r/homeautomation/comments/d5wbsi/why_zigbee/f0p7d18/,1,homeautomation
jec6613,"The three big advantages are scalability, price, and service life.

On scalability, a ZigBee network can scale much larger than a typical home WiFi network.  On an cheap home router, congestion starts occurring at 25 or so devices, with better ones it's 50 or so.  ZigBee (or Z-Wave, Insteon, or RA2) bypasses this issue by using a different protocol.  Additionally, each WiFi device needs an IP, and your typical home network only has a /24 subnet of 253 available IP addresses (after you remove the gateway and broadcast address) which will fill up quickly.

In terms of price, not only are ZigBee chips cheaper than WiFi chips, but as your network scales you'll need to add much more WiFi hardware.  Multiple WAPs at a minimum, and if you grow beyond a single subnet you'll need a managed switch and L3/L4 router to handle the traffic.  These costs add up quickly, as a typical router you could use with built-in switch capable of this sort of traffic segregation is $350 (Cisco RV345P), and you'll need access points all over the home ($160 each for an OK quality one), with their associated cabling costs, plus you'll need to know how to manage them all.  Running more Ethernet to any device that doesn't move is helpful as well.

Finally, there's service life.  Once the WiFi device is no longer supported by the manufacturer with firmware and security updates, you'll need to be replacing it or risk having your entire network compromised, even if you still have local control without relying on their cloud service.  In a ZigBee system, the only internet connected device is the hub itself, which is inexpensive to replace even if you have to do it every year.

That said, WiFi devices do offer unique advantages since they can expose controls not available in the standard protocols, and shouldn't be discounted if those features appeal to you.  I certainly have several WiFi devices in my home.",1568819923,f0otk55,t3_d5wbsi,t3_d5wbsi,/r/homeautomation/comments/d5wbsi/why_zigbee/f0otk55/,1,homeautomation

Single cylinder locks are more common than double cylinder. The two main reasons for this are efficiency and economy. Single cylinder locks are usually less costly to purchase and install than double cylinders. They are also more convenient, since there’s no need for a key to operate the lock from the inside. A simple thumb turn locks and unlocks the door.

**Double Cylinder** deadbolts, entry knobs, and handlesets require a key for locking and unlocking from both the exterior and the interior of the property. There is no thumb-turn mechanism on a double cylinder lock.

Why purchase a double cylinder lock? The main reason for doing so is enhanced security. This is particularly true for doors that have glass panels or adjacent windows (i.e. an arm’s reach).

bsievers,"Kwikset had a problem *years* ago. 

Kwikset SmartKey
The Kwikset SmartKey is the younger brother of the standard Kwikset deadbolt. It came out in 2008 and it works in a completely different technology than any other lock on the market. The purpose of this new technology is to allow the owner to easily change its key to a new key, without the hassle of calling a locksmith. Therefore, its interior structure is completely different, making the classic compromise methods useless. Every locksmith knows that whenever they need to unlock a Kwikset SmartKey, there’s no point in trying to pick, rake or bump it, drilling is the only option. When this lock first came out, it had a major security flaw where it could be unlocked easily with a flat-head screwdriver. As my testing showed – this flaw is long gone. Trying to pry it open with a screwdriver actually broke the head of my screwdriver off.

Curious what others are using them for!

Ravanduil,"Hey there. I actually just got done converting one of these. They work great. However, let me add some background to my ""conversion"" (and yes, you can get them to work with Home-Assistant and SmartThings after conversion)

Tuya is a chinese based company that offers a dev kit to resellers/manufacturers. The dev kit allows the company to slap their logo on the device and create a branded app (all the Tuya apps function the exact same way). Tuya then ships those devices to that company, so that company doesn't have to get involved with any of the other processes.

Here's my core issue: They use the Tuya Cloud, which according to [Michael Steigerwald, a security analyst](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9723-smart_home_-_smart_hack), Tuya cloud is vulnerable.

Therefore, the path to [tuya-convert:](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert)

Disclaimer: According to the folks that made Tuya-Convert, newer Tuya based devices are starting to block the conversion over wifi, so if they start shipping devices with newer firmware, you may have to figure out how to flash this manually by serial connection (By opening the cover and soldering contacts to get to the data pins). With that in mind, your mileage may vary.

If you can get it flashed (either over Wi-Fi or manually), I have created a template for this device that allows it to be controlled from Tasmota. Keep in mind, if using tuya-convert, it will not put you on the most recent version of Tasmota, so you will definitely need to update.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's the template for the 35557 (Monoprice Part Number) switches:](https://blakadder.github.io/templates/stitch_35557.html)

That should work for the ones you've linked. Keep in mind, since you need to use this particular template, you will need to upgrade to the latest development version, because the stable version does not have the required fixes for Tuya switches.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have Tasmota flashed and the templates set, you can integrate into [SmartThings](https://github.com/BrettSheleski/SmartThingsPublic/blob/master/devicetypes/brettsheleski/sonoff-tasmota.src/readme.md) or [HomeAssistant](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Home-Assistant)

I do manual config on Home Assistant over MQTT. If you need some code examples for Home Assistant, let me know. I don't really trust device discovery on any platform. I like to know that it isn't going to up and disappear.

All that said, I have just finished conversion of my SmartThings home to Home Assistant. I'm still using SmartThings to talk to my Z-Wave devices, but I'm bailing on SmartThings platform, because it feels like they're locking it down. If you need any pointers on either platform, feel more than free to send me a PM and I can give you config examples or help. If you do have to end up manually flashing the switch, and need pinout information, let me know and I'll see what I can dig up.",1568420011,f05ufj3,t3_d3u1t2,t3_d3u1t2,/r/homeautomation/comments/d3u1t2/can_the_monoprice_stitch_wall_switches_be/f05ufj3/,1,homeautomation

1Tekgnome,"Security systems are Hit or Miss, but there are a lot of things to look for. Any wireless systems that are not hard wired for each sensor will all suffer from wireless interference that a burglar can exploit to gain access:

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlNkQJzw4oA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlNkQJzw4oA)   


Things to look for in a security systems  


* **Ease of use**, things like keypad's phone apps, and English customer support  

* IF it is wireless it should use a **non standard frequency** to keep the ease of wireless interference down. This doesn't NOT make it invincible but significantly harder to by pass door and window sensors.  

* If you like yard signs and door stickers be sure to by them for a different brand than the one your using, **dont advertise to the bad guys what system your using** as they can easily just google what the easiest way to get in is.  

* **Scale-ability**, you should be able to add sensors and expand when your budget/conditions change.
* Lots of sensors, you'll need to be able to protect from door, windows, motion, glass break, extra siren,  

* **Redundancy**, 3G/4G with battery back up will save you!

Just to start  - It doesn't matter if you have a $1000 deadbolt if your door and frame are easily compromised. Here's the things you should check first:  


&amp;#x200B;

* What screws are holding your strikeplate in place? This is the little piece of metal on the door jamb that the bolt slides into. Most are just 3/4"" long and only secure the strike plate to the door trim, which is basically a tiny bit of soft wood. Which is why it's so easy to just kick a door open. Upgrade these to at least 3"" long screws. While you're at it, upgrade some of the hinge screws to also 3"" long. A 1lb box of screws costs $10 at Home Depot, and will be enough to secure every exterior door in your home, and can be installed with a power drill or screw driver.
* Upgrade the strike plate. Most strike plates that come with a lock are cheap stamped metal, with only two screw holes. A few of the nicer deadbolts at the hardware store will include an actual plate instead of just stamped metal, but I'd still buy a separate strike plate. Look for ones that are thicker metal, and have more screw holes. More screw holes means the force of a kick gets spread out over more screws and more wood. An upgraded strike plate can cost you about $5 - 10 per door for something pretty good, or $75 for ""door armor"" which is basically kick proof.  

* Door fit. Make sure you can't push certain spots of the door or frame to pop the door open. Make sure your weather striping is good, and there are no gaps that someone could easily get anything through - sides and bottom.  

* Door quality - make sure your door is not an interior door (believe it or not this happens). If you can, upgrade to one that is either solid, or reinforced. This can be expensive, but interior doors are *literally* made of cardboard. No point upgrading a door a baby can kick through to unlock.  

* Door location - Make sure that any windows near a door are not within reach of the lock. If they are, you should get window film put on them.  


I use a Yale Security YRD110ZW619 Push Button Deadbolt and it's freaking awesome with features such as.  


* Pick proof, it's not possible to pick the lock by conventional means.
* Built in tamper alarm. Prying on the lock will cause the alarm to go off.
* Solid steel construction.
* Hardened steel thick strike plate
* Anti saw hardened steel deadbolt core.
* Z wave with a motorized deadbolt assembly.
* Push button, non touch screen design. (push buttons hold up better in extreme cold and still react to input if your wearing gloves)
* Up to 8 digit master combination with the ability to program up to 100 normal user codes.

It's one of the cheapest smart locks on the market but probably one of the most secure. I use three of them on my home and I'm confident that a burglar would rather bust out my window then dick with my door. I have acoustic glass break sensors and motion detectors in side my home.

Mine ties in to my Abode security alarm system and automatically locks as soon as the door is closed.

My ""Goodbye"" routine turns off the lights/ceiling fans/plugs/etc., adjusts the A/C, locks several doors, closes the garage and arms my security system. It does all of that without me having to do anything... I just leave the house. It's also smart enough to know not to do it until the last person leaves. So, if my wife leaves, but I'm still at home, the routine doesn't trigger, but if I leave, then it does. That's just one routine out of about 12 that are fully automated.

If it's even possible to do something like that with a combination of IFTTT/Tasker/etc. it would be really complex and require a lot of different integrations and steps.

Another major advantage to using a hub is the addition of Z-Wave and Zigbee devices. It cannot be overstated how much better those types of devices are, and also the types of devices that become available.

Make a separate vlan network for them on your router, and give them a static ip in this vlan.

Use your firewall to block any WAN access to /from this vlan.

Now you can access the up cameras by their vlan IP address from your server to set up security software or whatever it is that you'd like to do with them.

The only downside I've found to doing this is that if the camera imprints the time automatically, it'll always be wrong. I even tried allowing time servers through my firewall, but these cheap cameras must connect to their own server to get the time.

kaizokudave,"Let's address the wifi first:
The ST wifi is probably just as good as any other wifi mesh. Orbi, google, etc.. The problem is the mesh itself. When you create a wireless bridge, you lose half the bandwidth on that antenna to support the uplink. If the bridges connect with 2.4ghz (5ghz sucks going through walls) then you're only going to get half your bandwidth, which in theory is anywhere from 200mbs to 500mbps. 

I'd recommend buying your own cable modem, (80 bucks  itll pay for itself)  buying a router, (your choice, can be just a router, router/switch, or wireless but you're going to disable the wireless $50 to 100 bucks, dont but one that's all weird looking, you dont need super fast wifi, you just want to make sure it's a 1gbps links) a wired 1gbps switch, (I'd recommend 16+ ports, if you plan on running cameras or access points then you'll want PoE, a tplink 16 port poe switch with 8 poe and 8 regular runs 120 bucks)  then using wired access points. (About 100 a pop) If you can't wire it, then wifi mesh is your only option.  So better than then nothing of course. 
Should run somewhere between 300 and 500 dollars depending on how many aps you want. 

I use:
Motorola docsis 3 cable modem. 
Asus router (going to switch to ubiquiti after I finish my office)
2 switches, (one 24 port 1gbps switch, one 16 port poe switch for my security cameras) 
2 ubiquiti AC-pro access points.  If I'm not mistaken, the AC pros CAN also do a wireless bridge, you can also daisy chain their network connections. So router could feed ap1, then ap1 would feed ap2, then ap2 could feed ap3, and so on.

MorimotoK,"Most routers will completely lock down your network unless you specifically open holes (ports). I recommend Edgerouters or Unifi USG's. They regularly update their firmware and they are rock solid devices.

With a good hub, none of your devices need internet access. So if you're worried about security stay away from anything that connects directly to your LAN, especially wifi devices. There are plenty of devices and sensors that connect to a hub (or each other) using zigbee and zwave. Since they don't connect directly to the internet they are very secure (unless someone is right next to your home and is trying to specifically sniff them out). Your only weak point would be the hub that they are connected to.

Hubs like SmartThings and Xiaomi require internet access, and in the case of the latter, will phone home to China. Home Assistant has a steeper learning curve, but recent updates have made it pretty easy. It can be completely isolated from the internet if you want, but it does need access to your LAN if you want to control it (unless you get creative with local switches and scripts).

For cameras you can get standalone NVRs (local recording boxes) that connect to cameras via ethernet cables. You can optionally connect them to the internet, but they work just fine without it if all you want to do is view the recordings locally on a TV.

This is a security alarm panel. From left to right: 

the first 2 terminals are your ac voltage input 16.5vac

Next 2 terminals are auxiliary power out, used to power motion detectors and keypads it provides 12vdc (looks like it is only powering the keypad via the cat 5 cable) 

Next 2 terminals are the output for your siren when the alarm goes off. 12vdc applied when system is armed and a door opens without a disarm.

Next 2 is your keypad data terminals yellow is data 1 or data out. Green is data 0 or data in. Looks like there is only one keypad to arm and disarm the system

Next 3 terminals are zone 1, a shared common (ground) for zone 1 and zone 2, zone 2. Both zone 1 and zone 2 are monitoring normally closed devices, more than likely door contacts on a front door and a back door. 

There are no outputs on this board to trigger any kind of door buzzer. Other than the siren terminals, which COULD be programmed to activate when one of the zones OPENS (not shorts). But this would be highly unlikely.

I don’t think this was ever used to open any doors. What exactly do you mean by “buzz” a door? Is there a chime that goes off when the door is opened that you want to sound when the intercom button is pushed? 

Sounds like to me... you have the functionality to “open a door” from your intercom and want to unlock your front door via the app. In which case it is HIGHLY HIGHLY unlikely that this panel was ever doing such a task.

TheLutronguy,"This can go in all sorts of directions.

First you should consider what you want to automate and why.

Lighting is a very big thing.

Motorized shades

Whole house music systems

Distributed video (TV and other sources)

Cameras

Security

Door intercom

Door locks

Irrigation

Pool and Jacuzzi pumps

I'm sure there are a few more things I am not thinking about right now.

All of the above products typically will have their own app. So someone that wants to keep things cost effective could just install the products of their choice and use the apps that come with them.

If you do your homework, you would also find things that ""work with Google home"" or Apple Homekit ect. From there you could make your own ""automation"" by setting up commands and using your voice.

Newer voice operated systems are fine, but not 100% there yet. There are things that can get clunky trying to operate from a voice command, and some people find that they do not always get the result they were expecting. Fun to play with, and if you keep things simple, you can have some automation this way.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want total control, all done through 1 app, you will need to look into systems from companies like Savant, Control 4, Elan g!, RTI and Crestron (or if you are in Europe KNX is also very big)

These companies offer a control solution. 

You can have lighting, music, TV and all the other things mentioned above, and they will get programmed to talk to each system. This gives you 1 App, with an interface that lets you choose which room you are in and what you want to do. You could also check your home while away, or let a service contractor in by turning off the alarm and unlocking the side door. Once they are done, you can lock things back up. I have a number of clients that spend the winter in Florida and they can let me in to do service work without me having to have keys or codes.

I do a lot of Lutron lighting and shading systems that get controlled by all of the above mentioned Home Automation companies. I find that for day to day convenience clients use Savant etc, but having the Lutron App is a big plus too, as they can make some changes to their lighting system without having to call me every time. 

These are not DIY products and will require finding a local integration company.

If you are more of a DIY type, there are also a few products out there like Home Seer and Vera (+others) that can let you set up your home on your own. I would do a lot of research before hand, nothing worse than spending $1000's thinking about a DIY solution and finding yourself in over your head.",1568052581,ezq0cba,t3_d1pb0h,t3_d1pb0h,/r/homeautomation/comments/d1pb0h/building_a_new_home_new_to_the_smart_home_scene/ezq0cba/,1,homeautomation

jec6613,"Splitting traffic generally is a good idea, with some caveats:

First, some devices need to be on the same broadcast domain (IP address range) as your phone, PC, etc. for them to work properly, or in some cases at all.

Second, you can start running into traffic congestion and other issues.

The, ""Proper,"" method to handle network security splitting is with VLANs.  This is what your guest network already uses, and it's a very useful tool to have around.  Using the same physical hardware, it allows you to split the network into multiple virtual networks.  A more advanced router can easily handle a dozen or more VLANs, and they're not that expensive for how much they do, either (the Cisco RV340W comes to mind).

Once you have the security split, you can then worry about wireless traffic.  If you get enough smart home devices, yes it's possible that you will need an additional access point to handle the traffic they generate (even a quiet WiFi device still generates traffic to keep connected to the access point).  While you can use dedicated hardware for this, the much better choice is to simply add more wireless access points beyond the one built into your router, or just skip the built-in one entirely and use dedicated WAPs with a wired only router.  Each access point provides all of the networks for both your personal devices and your smart home devices, and everything is kept segregated as programmed.  This also means that you add more capacity not just to your IoT devices, but to every device you own, and with better WAPs they can also manage traffic between them dynamically by shuffling the devices between which WAP they're attached to.

Personally, I use a dedicated wired router with a dozen or so VLANs, and four WAPs.  My total system capacity before I'd notice a slowdown is around 200 devices, and I'm not using particularly high end WAPs - upgrading to newer ones could easily handle 1,000 or more clients.  I have almost total coverage of my property with overlapping coverage from the WAPs so they can dynamically allocate traffic as required.

If you do it as outlined you’ll always have problems.  You actually have to hang the second network off the first network.

The correct way is using a different class of router or gateway that will allow you to create VLANs and rules about what can talk to what (see r/ubiquiti as an example).  It’s more secure but a lot of work to maintain and then there is the learning curve.

When it becomes important to do that is when purchasing odd inexpensive items from aliexpress, or flashing sonoff’s with some custom ROM you found on github, or even running a pi where you need to pay attention to security holes yourself.

ocdtrekkie,"I would strongly recommend against any Nest hardware. Google recently deprecated basically all Nest integrations with other home automation platforms with little warning. They've also had significant issues with service outages that cause people's homes to freeze in the winter and the like. You're putting a lot of trust in an incompetent company to keep your house in a functional temperature range.

With Ring you should also be aware of it's questionable arrangements with local police departments, and decide whether or not that's a company/platform you want to invest in based on their behavior so far.

I use Insteon hardware, and while I wouldn't recommend it right now for a few reasons, the highlight point is that all of it works great as ""dumb"" hardware without my home automation system, switches still work as switches, the thermostat runs correctly all by itself, etc. and that should be your first and foremost consideration when planning your home.

The biggest piece of advice I try to convey to new home automation buyers is that ""make everything smart"" is just a way to blow a lot of money, cause yourself a lot of headache, and not actually improve your life. Automation is not the goal you want to strive for, happiness and convenience is.

Think about things you want to happen automatically or at a scheduled time or in tandem, and then consider what hardware you need to make that happen. Do you need RGB lights everywhere? Are there places RGB lights would be particularly useful? What about how the light switches will work? (I prefer smart switches over smart bulbs for this reason.)

Note that POE-based security cameras can be powered through a network cable, which saves needing electrical ran to everywhere you put a camera, and Wi-Fi cameras are nice if you have electrical outlets places you can't run network cable, but straight up battery and Wi-Fi is going to be extremely short lived or extremely poorly performing, as collecting 24/7 video data and streaming it to a box somewhere burns a lot of power.",1567807908,ezautij,t3_d0lkxs,t3_d0lkxs,/r/smarthome/comments/d0lkxs/brand_new_to_smarthome_tech/ezautij/,1,smarthome

Each mode has its own security, light, camera and climate settings.

1. Turn off the HVAC system if an alarm zone (door\window) is violated for more than 5 minutes. Resume the mode (hot\cool\off) when the zones are all closed.

2. Geofence through homekit that locks the doors, turns everything off and then uses a light routine to make it appear someone is home after dark. (Nanoleaf has a TV mode that adds to this).

3. 2 hours after sunset, when a light switch is pressed it will only turn on to 20% to prevent your eyes from getting blasted with light.

4. Outdoor motion sensors and contact switches on gates are an early warning layer below the alarm system. Turns my nightstand on and sends an alexa voice alert when in sleep mode, sends a homekit notification when away.

5. Make sure the doors are closed for auto-locking after an hour. If not, notify me.

OnlyStoney,"As a computer hardware engineer, I'm a big fan of power and speed. After my wife and I purchased our house (that we had been renting for a couple of years) in 2016 I made the immediate plunge into wiring the house how I wanted. Here's exactly what I have done/plan to do: establish a server closet and get your isp to put your hookup there. In my case one of the closets in the master bedroom was split and the upper portion has ample room for a couple of servers, battery backups, enterprise grade 48 port switches with room for the drops. Having done IT in the past, I've always operated under the belief that it's better to way over-provision each ""drop"" and never send a single wire to one drop location. The reason being that if there's ever a problem with one or the wires in your drop, you always have a backup. In my house, it's a 3 bed 2 bath house with a great room that encompasses the modest kitchen, dining room, and above average size living room. I have plans to convert the basement and old garage (under the living room / dining room) into 3 more bedrooms, a bathroom, and hallway. I always plan to have at least 1 drop (two cat 6) to each bedroom upstairs, and my living room with 4 drops. The living room is so huge, I currently have a 4-wire drop behind the entertainment center, 2-wire drop by the front door (for the telephone), another 4-wire drop on the far side of the living room where the computer desk is, and another 2-wire drop still in the living room but near the dining room table (for laptops). Then I have wiring through the ceiling to my 4 ubiquiti ac pro access points which are two upstairs and two downstairs each set on ""low"" power for maximum throughout (speed). They also have zero handoff which is amazing! I have yet to set up my security system, but they will all be poe cameras all recording to my file server in the server closet. I'll probably have 8 outside cameras for the house and 3-4 for the garage. The downstairs bedrooms (yet to be built) will all have 2 drops of 2-wires each for a total of four cat 6 drops per room. I've currently got my entire house filled with smart switches in every room and for every lamp or device that makes sense. I've also got echo dots in every room and most bedrooms have a chromecast, firestick, or raspberry pi (or all 3) connected to the TV at that location. With absolutely everything I try to have it going through the ethernet even though all my access points could handle all my devices being wireless. Ethernet is so much more reliable and quicker, AND not to mention I've got a 48 port poe switch in my server closet which powers my chromecasts, fire sticks, and raspberry pi's so I never have to mess with ups's at each location.

I realize my set up is overkill, but if you think about it, it all makes sense. I've got excellent wireless coverage everywhere and one central location where I manage my power and ethernet from. I despise having little switches everywhere and having to reboot stuff. My linksys 48 port poe switch was $100 off ebay, and my other 48 port non-poe was $80 off ebay as well. Yes, I have spent quite a bit on my setup, but I did it slowly over the course of a year or so. I'm happy because everything is 100% rock solid and that makes my life much less stressful.

I will admit that I always wanted a setup like a currently have, but I had no idea the scale until I mapped it out. I wasn't trying to brag, on the contrary, my hope is that my description/list is helpful to somebody. Access point drops through the ceiling are almost always the #1 thing missed when provisioning a new construction build.

If you have Apple devices, consider getting some of the upcoming cameras that let you store video without an account, or one of the few WiFi cameras that let you store video locally, which of course you could back up to cloud storage, if you’d like. 

As for getting started, I did and continue to do so on a budget. I waited for sales, which happen constantly, to get my first hue starter kit. I haven’t paid full price for any of the 7 bulbs I have in my house. I also started by putting them in the rooms they were most-needed, like my kitchen, which has the dumbest switch placement - the light switch is in another room that you have to walk all the way through the kitchen to get to. After that, I bought bulbs and smart plugs as I saw deals on them, and now I’ve reached saturation. There are five bulbs I never smarted up, because I decided it wasn’t necessary or more convenient to have them there. I only have three smart plugs and only recently found a use for one of those. The two lamps on either side of my couch share a smart plug because I realized I never had just one of them on anyway. Beyond that, I have an ecobee thermostat, which is pretty nice, and works with more smart assistant platforms than Nest, though I preferred the nest interface. 

I technically have a smart TV, but I don’t use its smarts because I prefer using the Apple TV (which I also got on a sweet deal directv was running last year), and I have a combination of google home minis and a HomePod that let me operate everything. I also recommend using your smart speakers for grocery lists. You can use the built in Alexa grocery list if you want, but I recommend getting IFTTT and having items added to that list automatically transfer to another app. I liked Todoist. 

I didn’t bother with much else, and probably won’t, unless I get a great deal on a robot vacuum.

0mz,"IEEE discusses the four most common modes of damage from transient currents due to lightning.  From most common to least common:

1)  Strike to distribution network propagates to the home via the service entrance.  Most common and the classic indirect strike. 
 Effective protection provided by grounding at utility pole and SPDs at meter/main panel.

2)  Strike to outdoor equipment that is connected to the home.  HVAC, antenna, dish, outdoor security lighting.  Some of these are easier to mitigate (antenna, dish) than others (HVAC).  

3)  Induced currents due to strong EMF from a nearby strike.  We will revisit this at the end.

4)  Direct strikes to the structure.  Mitigate with LPS (lightning rods, etc).

In the case of u/One800J 's damage it may be error to rule out mode 3.  

A cursory review indicates it is not unheard of in wired alarm systems due to the antennas created by the signal wires feeding directly into low voltage systems.  SPDs at the alarm panel on these signal wires may well mitigate his issue.  IEEE does recognize the potential for this damage:

&gt;As shown in Figure 2, lightning may strike nearby objects (trees, flagpoles, signs)
that are close to, but not directly connected to the house (mode 3). In this
situation, the lightning strike radiates a strong electromagnetic field, which can be
picked up by wiring in the house, producing large voltages that can damage
equipment.

It is also possible that his damage is due to mode 4.  If this was the case it is almost certainly immediately apparent upon inspection that his roof is being struck directly.  Even though mode 4 is relatively rare, probabilities can be much higher than average for a specific home and his is 4 stories.  A proper LPS system is in order if he is indeed getting common direct strikes.

In any case he should be prudent and inspect the grounding system at his utility pole and his service entrance, but based on all of his information provided my list of suspects is ranked. 3, then 4.  1 is improbable (what would the path be?) and unless he discovers faults can be ruled out entirely.

2 is also worth investigating.  There may be sensors or other system wiring outside of the home.",1567269284,eyo44rh,t3_cx2vi6,t1_eyns187,/r/homeautomation/comments/cx2vi6/security_panel_surge_protection/eyo44rh/,1,homeautomation

Now I can use a ""command center"" in the basement and use a variety of different wireless brands and wired switches in strategic locations from where  many distant loads can be controlled.   I use relays in the large boxes, controlled via the 18ga or twinned cat5 pairs at 24V and can use photocells, ""laser guarding"" salvaged from machine tools and motion sensors to trigger and/or de-energize different things like lights, solenoids to water parts of the garden, solenoids coupled with LED security lights to spray gateways, recycling, and even the front doorway if I don't like the look of someone or we are away.  The moving water also triggers cheap trail cams and we found out that we are soaking cougars, bears, raccoon, smaller wild and domestic cats, and ravens who have figured out how to get a drink. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like having a central place in the basement so I can use clunky old magnetic contactors for logic, and the larger boxes let me stuff relays close to a load if needed.  I also ran 6""PVC used municipal water pipe 6 to 8 feet underground while we had our back yard excavated, and use ducting and quiet fans to circulate fresh, cold air through the house, all controlled with thermostats and manual switches routed via the same control cabling.  Dead high end refrigerators and dishwashers are a great source for solenoids and fans that run quietly.

airmandan,"WeMo is hot garbage -- literally, their smart plugs have a history of starting themselves on fire.

Their cloud service goes out constantly, so if you're looking for voice control, be prepared for total unavailability, especially during peak times.  It goes hard down for a couple days after Christmas pretty much every time.  Mechanically, the switches (I can only speak for the first generation on/off and the dimmer) are fine, and I actually quite like the dimmer's slider for dimming.

But, the app, oh man.  The WeMo app is required to set up the devices, and there's no avoiding it.  The devices are 2.4GHz only, which is common, but the App will struggle *hard* to set them up if your phone reconnects to a 5GHz network during the awkward setup process, which requires you to pair your phone to the switch's built-in wifi, and then your phone sends your wifi configuration to the switch, and then both the switch and your phone are supposed to reconnect to the main wifi to complete the setup.  It's fraught with glitches and crashes, though.

Using the app itself is little better.  There's no way to group switches or create scenes, and the rules engine is a well-known steaming pile.

Then there's the security.  For the longest time Belkin has refused to acknowledge or address the fact that there is *something* fundamentally broken with their ""accountless"" cloud account system.  What happens is sometimes you will see in your WeMo app devices that *do not belong to you* and worse still, you can control them.  And you have no way of knowing if someone else can see and control *your* devices.

I had several hundred dollars invested in making my whole home smart with WeMo.  Switches, dimmers, even bulbs on the now-discontinued WeMo Link.  It was so bad, so unreliable, so incredibly frustrating that I compiled all my receipts for all the purchases of WeMo products I'd ever made, complained my way up to the executive team, and sent them all back for a refund.

\- an Android smartphone running Alfred

\- powered by a standard supply at all times, but if the power is cut, then it switches to its own battery

This way, power is always on (well, at least for maybe 4 hrs until the battery dies); and the Internet connection is always on due to the smartphone automatically flipping to its cellular connection if WiFi is no longer there.

I totally agree... get as much that works without the Internet as possible. I believe in wiring as much as possible too. Do not rely on WiFi/RF if at all possible. While I do have Nest thermostats. I have spent the time to wire all my security webcams. 

I'm a huge fan of Insteon/ISY994. I'm on my third house with this technology. Most of the devices will communicate over RF and over the powerline. This redundancy is nice. If you go this route, get the ""pro"" ISY as it will allow for more devices than you could possibly use for a residential property (probably).

I'm not sure if this only applies to Insteon or not, but if you are looking at generators be sure to get one that produces a clean sine wave. I may be over-simplifying this, but if you ARE getting a generator get a whole-house model. It will ready whenever there is a problem. I believe any mainstream whole-house generator produces clean sine waves. It took me a bit to figure out why the temporary portable generator we are using while renovating our house doesn't work with the Insteon light switches.

jec6613,"AFAIK all of the WiFi thermostats work on the same model: a single connection to a cloud service, and everything connects to that.  This has data collection implications, particularly with Nest and Ecobee, but it's primarily about security: by only having a single secure link outbound, it keeps the thermostat very secure against any possibly compromised devices on your LAN.

For true local control, there are Z-Wave options that are pretty good.  Insteon makes a thermostat as well that isn't terrible if you have a basic single stage heat and cooling system with a single air handler, but given the Z-Wave are better with more options I'd go with that if you want true local control.  Neither Z-Wave nor Insteon look sexy, but they do work.

jec6613,"Congrats!  And don't worry, it'll get even scarier in a few months … then it gets really, really fun.  Oh, and mowing the lawn is incredibly relaxing, nothing to do but make perfect rows.

Your home network is at least straightforward: if your home is small enough for one decent router, that's a good way to go, if not, and you can run Ethernet cable through an unfinished basement or attic, use a wired WAP system, and if you can't do that, then go for a mesh system.  Orbi is by far the fastest when it comes to mesh, but they all provide the coverage you'll need.

Moving right along, plan.  Write everything down, do spreadsheets, and know where you're going, because it's very expensive to have to buy the same thing twice.  When it comes do that, here are my lessons from buying my first house a few years ago:

1. Fit and finish matters. It's yours now, spend the money and get things that look and work nice. Get wallplates you like, screwless if possible, and go toggle or paddle to your preference. Also, be prepared to replace all of the dumb switches and outlets, too, to get something that's nice and matches.
2. Everything should work the way people expect it to. Bulbs may work in an apartment, but in a home guests expect light switches and so on to react as normal. Smart switches are the way to go, and save smart bulbs for when you want color changing - and even then, get a smart switch. As a bonus: they save money since they're cheaper than bulbs. For dumb bulbs, Philips' Warm Glow line is fantastic. Voice assistants are OK, but make sure the physical controls are still there are react as people expect them to.
3. There is a big advantage to automating everything you're allowed by building code to of a particular device class, especially things like lighting and locks. Not having to walk around and shut them all off at night ends up making a good lighting system pay for itself, and a smart lock on every exterior door (with a keyway, of course, just in case) means you can secure the house at night easily. Same for garage doors: if you have two, don't automate just one.
4. Automation is the ticket, not just smart devices. Remote control and scheduling just makes it a fancy version of the clapper, but once you integrate sensors and logical branches then you're really talking about automation. Ideally, you should interact with your home as little as possible. Shouting at an Echo isn't much more convenient than picking up a remote control (1970's tech) or even that much more convenient than hitting a physical switch.
5. Make sure the electrical box is up to snuff. Something modern capable of AFCI breakers at least, and 200 Amp service, otherwise figure replacing that into your budget. You're about to dump thousands of dollars into sensitive electronics, you need a good sine wave.
6. Don't lock yourself into some, ""Ecosystem,"" based on a cloud service. There are three major dedicated HA protocols: Insteon, Z-Wave, and ZigBee, and each has advantages and disadvantages (see below).
7. Get a good thermostat with setback, quickly: it'll pay for itself in maybe half a year even if it's not smart and is just running a schedule. Nest and Ecobee are the hot ticket, but for my money look at the old standbys: Honeywell, Johnson Controls, and the like. They're much better at being a thermostat and controlling temperature, and being reliable.
8. Buy on sale, and in bulk. Once you've decided your plan, sign up for e-mail lists to get coupon codes and buy lots of them when on sale, and have a number you want at any given time. I don't think I've paid more than $30 for a switch, and all but two switches that code allows are smart (and that's because I need re-wiring).

I'm not a fan of either Ring or Nest, because both go belly up once the internet goes down.  And I agree, having products that work offline is best, and that's why I use offline protocols.  Additionally, directly internet connected (e.g. WiFi) devices tend to have longevity issues, as the manufacturers stop supporting them after a few years at most.  This can be mitigated by using large brands, and when you buy appliances think about the appliance first, any smart features are secondary to the primary functionality.  My microwave is dumb, and my refrigerator smarts is a tiny wireless sensor, etc.  If it's not going to benefit you, don't bother with it.  Oh the other hand, my washer and dryer are WiFi connected because they're in the basement, so that's very useful.

&amp;#x200B;

For the rest of the devices, you'll need to know about the three major HA protocols:

Insteon uses a dual broadcast mesh, with both powerline and RF signaling, so it works well with steel electrical boxes, and theoretically unlimited devices (with a practical limit of several thousand, notably the British Embassy in DC uses it). It's also natively peer to peer, so basic remote control from across the home still works without a controller, and response time is instantaneous. The home-oriented lighting controls are only made by their own first party products, but they're leaders in quality, and the standard is available and implemented by several other manufacturers as well. They also have all of the oddball lighting choices, including switches which don't require a neutral, DIN rail modules, micro modules, in-line, and high wattage, in a unified high quality look at feel.

Z-Wave uses a routed mesh network and RF only, with a device limit of 232 (which sounds like a lot, but in reality a modest sized home can hit that very easily). It's come a long way since its first implementation, and now supports many of the features of Insteon, but it does rely on your controller being available: even with Z-Wave association (a peer to peer link) eventually the lack of a controller will cause them to fail. However, since it's been updated more recently, it sports better encryption and security than Insteon, and there are a number of products that are best with Z-Wave or only available with Z-Wave, including contactors and access control systems. Though there are many device manufacturers, the chipset is from a single vendor (as is Insteon), and this leads to unevenness in implementation of devices and no one manufacturer has a full deep product line. The latency issues of it are also starting to be resolved with the newest 700 series chipsets.

ZigBee is a bit of an odd duck here, in that it wasn't designed for HA, it was designed for any one device class at all. Those smart electric meters and demand response systems of the power grid? Those run on ZigBee. As do Philips' Hue and Ikea's TRADFRI. As do many wireless security system sensors. It was designed as a general purpose low power low bandwidth protocol, which has lead to a bit of a mish-mash in implementation. That said, for the oddball controls, they're often the only game in town.

If you stick to those three, you'll be golden long term, as they all offer excellent backwards and forwards compatibility and have an established track record. And it sounds like no one of them has every answer, you'd be correct: for a big system in the DIY space, you'll need at least two of those, plus IP devices. The usual combinations are ZigBee+Z-Wave for smaller systems, and Insteon+Z-Wave for bigger systems.

Lastly, once you've figured out all of the major design elements, then you can start working on a controller.  This is what will provide all of the logic to feed its sensors and other data and automate the home.  And, yes, it comes last at least if you're planning properly.  Homeseer and Vera are popular turnkey solutions with different advantages and disadvantages, but all will continue working offline.

jec6613,"If you're looking at home appliances, first look at the big boys, and skip shiny features.  Android in my refrigerator?  No thank you.  Anything that has integration should be first one of the best appliances in that class.  Smart washing machine?  Make sure it's the right washer first, anything else is an add-on.

I have literally hundreds of smart devices in my home, but things like my toaster oven, microwave, and coffee pot?  I have a basic programable coffee pot that also takes Keurig pods, and my other appliances are completely offline.  The intelligence in my refrigerator comes from a cheap sensor I added on, and so on.  About the only real, ""Smart,"" appliances I have are my washer and dryer, and that's because they're in the basement so I wanted notifications better than I could get from outlet sensing, and even then, if support ends for those?  I can unplug the WiFi modules and run an Ethernet cable between the two (so load data can be sent from washer to dryer) and they will keep working for years and years.

IP devices can add completely unique features, so shouldn't be discarded out of hand like some may say.  I use Dyson air cleaners, Logitech Harmony remotes, GE Washer and Dryer, and a few others.  But sticking with big established manufacturers who will support their products for a long time and have good end of life policies is best here.

&amp;#x200B;

When it came to devices that have more integral utility from connectedness, like lighting and sensors, offline protocols are your friend.  For one thing, the data transmission requirements are minimal, so using a dedicated protocol saves you electricity and from obsolescence, and for another, the basic functionality has been around since the 1970's in X10: it's well proven at this point.  The heavy hitters here are Insteon, Z-Wave, and ZigBee, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages:

Insteon uses a dual broadcast mesh, with both powerline and RF signaling, so it works well with steel electrical boxes, and theoretically unlimited devices (with a practical limit of several thousand, notably the British Embassy in DC uses it).  It's also natively peer to peer, so basic remote control from across the home still works without a controller, and response time is instantaneous.  The home-oriented lighting controls are only made by their own first party products, but they're leaders in quality, and the standard is available and implemented by several other manufacturers as well.  They also have all of the oddball lighting choices, including switches which don't require a neutral, DIN rail modules, micro modules, in-line, and high wattage, in a unified high quality look at feel.

Z-Wave uses a routed mesh network and RF only, with a device limit of 232 (which sounds like a lot, but in reality a modest sized home can hit that very easily).  It's come a long way since its first implementation, and now supports many of the features of Insteon, but it does rely on your controller being available: even with Z-Wave association (a peer to peer link) eventually the lack of a controller will cause them to fail.  However, since it's been updated more recently, it sports better encryption and security than Insteon, and there are a number of products that are best with Z-Wave or only available with Z-Wave, including contactors and access control systems.  Though there are many device manufacturers, the chipset is from a single vendor (as is Insteon), and this leads to unevenness in implementation of devices and no one manufacturer has a full deep product line.  The latency issues of it are also being resolved with the newest 700 series chipsets.

ZigBee is a bit of an odd duck here, in that it wasn't designed for HA, it was designed for any one device class at all.  Those smart electric meters and demand response systems of the power grid?  Those run on ZigBee.  As do Philips' Hue and Ikea's TRADFRI.  As do many wireless security system sensors.  It was designed as a general purpose low power low bandwidth protocol, which has lead to a bit of a mish-mash in implementation.  That said, for the oddball controls, they're often the only game in town.

If you stick to those three, you'll be golden long term, as they all offer excellent backwards and forwards compatibility and have an established track record.  And it sounds like no one of them has every answer, you'd be correct: for a big system in the DIY space, you'll need at least two of those, plus IP devices.  The usual combinations are ZigBee+Z-Wave for smaller systems, and Insteon+Z-Wave for bigger systems.

&amp;#x200B;

To tie all of that together, along with the above mentioned IP devices, you'll need a central controller.  Initially you can go with something simple: a manufacturer's hub or two and a few apps is a good starting point, and it's often thrown in for free or close to it, and can give you time to plan and decide where to go next.  As you grow though, you'll need something with the ability to talk to multiple offline protocols as well as your IP devices in one system, usually the ISY994 or [HASS.io](https://HASS.io) fits the bill there.  Both use Python to allow communications to most IP devices, though they take vastly different approaches: the ISY994 runs on a RTOS and its focus is on automation and low latency, and an RPI or their new Polisy is required for IP communications, and it's a highly supported commercial product; [HASS.io](https://HASS.io) is open source, and the entire system runs on Python, leading to some capacity issues (my system is too big for anything approaching acceptable latency, for instance), and is open source with limited support resources, but because of that they have many more unusual integrations and are a bit of a Rosetta Stone for compatibility.

Lastly of course, there are the high end fully integrated systems: Lutron RA2, Crestron, Elan, Control4, and so on.  These are commercially installed and supported and last a very long time and are extremely high quality, but come with price tags that can be eye watering.

Thijs-vr,"Personally I don't like to rely on cameras for motion detection. The more expensive versions are fairly reliable, but I wouldn't rely on them for mission critical things like this.

For mission critical stuff I would want redundancy or hardwired solutions. If you are willing to DIY a bit you can probably get a reliable solution together for very little. 

You can get switches like these: [https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/3pcs-NO-normally-open-Wired-Security-Alarm-door-magnetic-contact-reed-switch-J5U/303212741924](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/3pcs-NO-normally-open-Wired-Security-Alarm-door-magnetic-contact-reed-switch-J5U/303212741924?epid=2071059218&amp;hash=item4698e34524:g:pXQAAOSwIbFdHh9q) (but you can probably get them way cheaper on something like Ebay). Make sure you get NO types and not NC types. NO stands for Normally Open. These are super simple devices. You attach one part to the door frame and the other to the door. If the door or window is closed and the two parts are close together, the circuit is open. Once the door or window opens, the circuit closes and you can trigger anything you want with it.

You could wire it into something like this: [https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Emergency-Personal-Alarm-Keychain-Safe-Sound-Women-Kid-Self-Defense-Alarms-GG/303030483816](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Emergency-Personal-Alarm-Keychain-Safe-Sound-Women-Kid-Self-Defense-Alarms-GG/303030483816?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D20160908110712%26meid%3Dea4298df64ff4fca8a6965767586d467%26pid%3D100677%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D30%26mehot%3Dag%26sd%3D303021932539%26itm%3D303030483816%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2385738&amp;_trksid=p2385738.c100677.m4598) (again, you can find cheaper things like this). Door opens, circuit is closed and this thing goes off and wakes the whole neighbourhood. With some super basic soldering skills you would be able to make this work for maybe $5 per door and it would be reliable.

If that's too much, you could switch to NC (Normally Closed) types and wire them up in series. Meaning you would build a circuit of these things all wired together. If the doors are all closed, the circuit is complete. If any one door or window in the circuit is opened, the circuit is broken which could function as the trigger for an alarm. The downside of this is that you would add some complexity because you would need something that can interpret the opened circuit and take action. You could get a cheap Z-Wave switch for maybe $20 that would be able to do that. That could then send a notification to your phone or if you have a hub, to an alarm in the network.

This is basically how all off the shelf window and door switches work. The only downside is that you can prevent them from triggering with a magnet. If that's a concern, you can get ones that sink into the door frame. They're a tiny bit more expensive and definitely more annoying to install, but if you put in the work you can make them almost invisible and they'll be a fair bit more difficult to circumvent.

3. My understanding is that Lutron and Somfy shades only need 16/2 for power, so the other two conductors are for future-proofing, right? If so, what do installers expect those conductors to be used for in the future — communication or more power?
4. It appears that the price difference between shielded and unshielded 16/4 is less than $50 for my entire home.  If the two extra wires in 16/4 will be used for communication instead of power, is it possible that the shield will provide some benefit? I noticed that Lutron's cable combines unshielded 16/2 for power and shielded 22/2 for communication. It appears that shielded 16/4 has the shield around all 4 wires together, so unlike Lutron's cable, the communication wires wouldn't be shielded from the power wires. I imagine that makes the 16/4 shielding useless for this application, but I'm not sure.

firestorm_v1,"I'm hesitant to post this because last time I did, I was called a ""bored, paranoid CCNA"" but here goes anyways...

First thing's first, design your network from the ground up with security in mind.  Use a good router (pfSense or the like), an inexpensive managed switch (I use HP switches, but also have others), and learn how to segment your network.  

I have four VLANs at home, ""main"" (workstations and servers), ""servers"" (for internal servers), DMZ (for externally reachable servers), IOT (for home automation), ""Hostile"" for foreign computers being diagnosed and repaired, and ""Guest"" for friends.  I have firewall rules that allow main to access any network (bound per IP address), DMZ, IOT, and Guest can only access the Internet but can't access each other.  For the Hostile, IOT, and Guest networks specifically, there are no inbound rules (From Internet to PC) and at least all the IOT devices I've used, they don't require any inbound rules. I'd be highly suspect of any IOT device that requires inbound access, the devices I use will connect outbound to 'phone home' but nothing inbound.

Until I got Wyze cameras, I had a ""closed loop VLAN"" (vlan with no Internet connectivity) that was used between a handful of Foscam cameras and my NVR to prevent the cameras from phoning home.  Now with the Wyze cameras, they are on the IOT network.  If you want to use Foscam or similar cameras (ones that don't use an app to view/configure) along with an NVR, your best bet is to build in a closed loop VLAN to prevent them from phoning home.  

Since you mentioned cameras, you'll want to think about backup management.  Do the videos those cameras record go off-site somewhere to a cloud backup service or a third party (like Nest or Ring)?  In my case, the wyze cams have RTSP and are monitored by Shinobi.  Shinobi (shoutout to /r/ShinobiCCTV) records the videos to a local storage server which is mirrored to an identical storage server I host in colocation.  Also, workstation backups (family PCs) are similarly replicated so gods forbid, the house is destroyed, I have backups elsewhere I can pick up where I left off.

Now, we've talked about all this complexity, but let's dig down into why it's necessary.  If someone hacks my Wink hub, they gain access to the IOT network.  The worst they're going to be able to do is hack my lights.  They can't VLAN hop into any other network, they're essentially cut off from any of the more interesting targets.  If I have a ransomware'd machine on my Hostile network, it won't have new hosts to attack.  Worst case scenario, if someone attaches a malicious machine to my main network, they would then need to compromise one of my workstations then they might get access to my servers.  While this is plausible, it's not really all that likely to happen and if it does, you have far more important things to worry about than your lights coming on at 3AM.

VLAN configurations are daunting, but once you get the hang and the principles of what VLANs are and how they work, you can spin it up rather quickly.  PfSense is well documented, and there's a helpful subreddit for it as well.  As far as switches go, most of them will have a web-based UI and/or a CLI that is usually well documented.  If you've never worked with networking like this, it might take you a week to get through the configuration but the payoff and security it provides is well worth it (plus it looks real good on a resume).",1566419486,exlueac,t3_cteulj,t3_cteulj,/r/homeautomation/comments/cteulj/security_the_boring_stuff/exlueac/,1,homeautomation
godofpumpkins,"On the switch/dimmer side, I recently asked the sub about Insteon and got lots of mostly positive feedback on them. I’d try to stay away from large numbers of WiFi devices on a network (i.e., for dozens of dimmers/switches around a house). That leaves the big players: open Z-wave devices, Lutron’s proprietary options (folks here rave about Caséta, but it has range and device limits; they have an annoying tiering system that forces you into $100+ per device and mostly pro installers if Caséta is too limiting), or Insteon with its semi-open protocol and comparatively inexpensive devices. I’m opting for Insteon for my retrofit job of the large house I just bought because I can get dimmers for under $25 a pop, it communicates over both RF and power lines, and seems pretty robust (p2p devices talk directly to each other as needed, as well as to a hub or third-party hub like the ISY). The company made some strategic missteps in the past and is working to remediate them, and the RF protocol has some known security vulnerabilities so folks have largely stopped using it for security-sensitive devices like door locks, but otherwise it seems like a pretty solid choice.

o2bnMaine,"The other comments are on point. I have been converting my house to be a smart home. The most time I spend on projects? running cables for PoE. Luckily, I have an unfinished basement. I only have one room on the second floor, so the basement gets me almost all my access. But for the pool house, dock and firepit etc, I find I'm constantly looking at how to get CAT6e or 110v out to some corner of the property. PoE can power low-voltage lights, by the way, so the only reason I want power anywhere is so I can power a smart speaker or some ""dumb"" device. 

I would suggest looking into Insteon smart technology. I know Z-Wave works too, but I'm not a fan of them as I've had issues connecting the handful of Z-Wave devices I've tried to use in the past. Also, from my research, Insteon allows for a more streamlined management process if you need to switch out a hub or switch. Insteon has been very solid for me. 

If you go this route, you'll end up with smart-switches in all your rooms. The switches can control other switches, which means you do NOT need to wire for 3-way configurations. This should save your electrician time in doing the installation and you will spend less on the actual wires. (There may be rooms you want to wire for 3-way regardless but you aren't required to do this.)

I just renovated my livingroom. I chose to add an extra switch on the east and west side of the room just in case I want to program them to do something unforeseen today. I could program them to turn ALL lights in the surrounding rooms on, if I want to. Or I could program them to initiate recording video from my security cameras. 

If you really wanted to be forward-looking, look into installing low-voltage lighting in your house only using 110v lights for the high-power requirements. I use low-voltage floods powered over PoE on my boat dock, for example. All I needed to run was a CAT6e cable.

tannebil,"If you are doing conventional wiring, have extra deep switch boxes installed so there is plenty of room for smart switches. Make sure that there are neutrals in each box (not required by code everywhere). The more clever they get with the switch wiring and the lighting, the more likely you are to encounter an issue doing something later. Halogen strips in a cabinet accounted for about 95% of the issues I had installing Caseta.

""Mesh"" networking is just fine. What you want to avoid is wireless ""backhaul"" links between the access points. Most consumer ""mesh"" systems work with wired and wireless links and provide a single-point of management and value-added services. If you want to be a network engineer, there are real advantages to products like Ubiquit UniFi but it's a non-trivial increase in expertise required to get those advantages. When planning your access point locations, anticipate that things like HVAC ducting, plumbing, mirrors, and concrete walls will significantly reduce signal strength.

Conduit will solve problems 20 years from now but CAT6 should be fine for now. If it's your ""forever home"", it might be worth the investment but you won't get the cost back on a resale. You can go crazy running CAT6 everywhere but, if at all possible, get them to not staple it to the risers. If it's hanging freely, it's possible to pull a replacement.

Get CAT6 run to locations where you'd mount security cameras even if you are not planning on installing them. Maximum flexibility comes from having AC in those locations as well.

Personally not a big fan of running cable for in-wall speakers and local volume controls but it's a personal matter. The one thing I wish I had was conduit or pre-run audio cables for surround speakers in the main AV room. More power outlets would have been handy.

Some people may advise pre-run cables for motorized window treatments but my Serena blinds are still on the original batteries after 2 1/2 years of regular use.

Thermostat depends on the type of HVAC equipment installed. If you have continuously variable speed equipment, you are usually stuck with proprietary thermostat. I went from conventional gas/AC with Nest to a Trane heat pump+proprietary thermostat and the increase in comfort (Pacific Northwest Coast) was well worth it but it's a trade-off.

If you are getting a sprinkler system, try to make sure they allow room in the box to add a flow meter later.

I_Arman,"The first step to choosing a hub is figuring out what tech you want to control. Personally, I avoid WiFi at all cost; between cheap knockoffs with security holes wide enough to drive a botnet through, and the unreliable future (a la Nest), it's not worth it (I would suggest a Z-Wave thermostat, in fact). Z-Wave is a little more expensive, but a lot more reliable; Zigbee can have some issues with existing WiFi, and there's a bit of fragmentation, but some hubs that support it can also control Philips lights. Bluetooth mesh is another option, but doesn't have much more than bulbs out there at the moment. There are other techs out there, but they generally will lock you in to one brand - not particularly open source.

Assuming you stick with Z-Wave or Zigbee, there is another option - OpenHAB, or HomeAssistant. I don't have a lot of experience with HA, but I've been running OpenHAB for a couple years now.

**Pros:**

it's inexpensive; a Raspberry Pi 3B+, case, charger, SD card, and a Z-Wave USB dongle (or Zigbee, or both, or one of each...) is really all you need to get started. If you already have a PC you could even use that.

It works with a *huge* range of things, including Zigbee and Z-Wave. For example, I have two Amazon Dash buttons that interact with the system, one acting as a switch in a location that would otherwise be awkward to wire, the other acting as a drop-in ""test button"", to act as a trigger for various events. I've also got some cheap wired sensors monitoring doors and windows; at $1 per sensor plus wire, they are way cheaper and more reliable than wireless, but there aren't a lot of systems that do both.

It's local. The biggest problem I had with every hub I owned was that it was cloud-based; sure, some of the functionality (like automation) worked without a functioning internet connection, but there was no way to use them if you didn't have internet access. OH doesn't have that problem, because it doesn't need to ""phone home"" to work.

It's accessible remotely (if you want). All you have to do is sign up at myopehhab.org, and you can access your OpenHAB device from anywhere. But, it's entirely optional - if you don't want it to be controllable from outside your network, it won't be. And, if you set it up with myopenhab, you can hook Google or Alexa into it as well, to anything you want!

There's an app, too. It works both locally on your home WiFi, and remotely through myopenhab.

There is a great forum to get help and discuss issues, too, and they are quite responsive; any problems you run into, you can get some quick assistance.

**Cons:**

It's a little tricky to set up. There is a pre-built image made for Raspberry Pi, and it's not terribly hard to install on Debian-based systems (that's what I've used, anyway), but there are a few options that can be a pain, especially if you want to get fancy.

Speaking of, programming experience helps. You can make a lot of automated rules easily in the UI - turn on the light when the door opens, that sort of thing - but more complex rules might require that you actually write them by hand. It's Java-like, if you're into that kind of thing.

While it supports Google and Alexa, it's a little tricky to get them set up. If you want it to, say, control your TV volume, you'll have to label that control as a ""dimmer"".

It doesn't have a phone support line, warranty, or technicians. If something goes wrong, you'll have to troubleshoot it yourself.

---

To answer some of your other questions:

You shouldn't need more than one hub. I have a 3500 sq ft home, on two floors, and I have absolutely no trouble with range. The beauty of Zigbee and Z-Wave is that each (wired) device acts as a repeater, extending the network, so if the signal isn't reaching some back corner, all you have to do is add a switch, plug, bulb, etc., and it'll extend the range to include it.

For windows/doors, you can get any number of sensors: in-door sensors, hinge sensors, or basic window sensors are all available as Z-Wave devices (for about $20 each, though some allow you to wire a second switch to the one sensor). Like I mentioned, I use some wired sensors that connect directly to my Raspberry Pi - if you have existing wired sensors, you can probably use them. It depends on the exact setup as to how useful they'll be. For my setup, I essentially have all the windows wired together, so I can tell if *a* window is open, but not *which* window. Doors are currently on wireless sensors.

Good luck!",1566066473,ex7ym66,t3_crlmtq,t3_crlmtq,/r/homeautomation/comments/crlmtq/where_to_start_what_hub_is_best/ex7ym66/,1,homeautomation

o2bnMaine,"Good advice. Each room should have two Cat6 cables. One needs to be connected to a PoE switch. This gives you lots of flexibility for security cameras or adding mesh network WiFi points. 

Cat6 cable should go to each corner of the house and over each door -- or wherever you think you may want a security camera. 

You see a trend. Even today with super-stable WiFi I choose to wire as much as possible. This applies to home automation and security. Hackers can show up with a WiFi jammer that would shut down your security system. Wire it. Done.

Look at Insteon for smart switches (they do NOT rely on WiFi). Look at Universal Devices ISY hub for home automation. Home Assistant is another great option for home automation. Insteon uses RF and powerline for communicating with other switches. This will be as close as you can get to avoid a jammer. A thief has to work pretty hard to jam your powerline communications along with RF.

People talk about Z-Wave. It seems to work well for people, but I have not had much luck with connecting Z-Wave into my home automation.  I do see others complaining too, so buyer beware. 

I have a 220v Insteon switch that controls my electric hot water tank. I have a 110v Insteon switch that powers up my irrigation system. I have another for the pool pump. You get the idea. Besides lights, you can do a lot with Insteon.",1565883232,ewylser,t3_cpfc5k,t1_ewp0z5f,/r/homeautomation/comments/cpfc5k/new_home_construction_home_automation_options/ewylser/,1,homeautomation
o2bnMaine,"Choose Universal Devices' ISY hub to control Insteon devices. This will keep you away from using too many WiFi smart devices. Insteon has been a very stable product for me. Through the ISY Portal, you can integrate into Google Home/Assistant very easily. You have tons of flexibility. AND you are not giving your information to a bunch of other companies. I assume UDI will have access, but they would be the only other one, I believe.

If you go with Nest, that gets you thermostats, security, doorbell, smartlock and webcams. Add UDI Insteon devices and you get light switches and other smart devices like leak and motion detectors. You can add automated water valves to stop water flow when leaks are detected. Getting a call from a security company when water is detected is annoying as it doesn't accomplish anything.

I suspect you can accomplish just about everything you want with Insteon/UDI and Nest/Google. I am only giving this recommendation because you can do it all with two. I am not a huge fan of Nest cameras or their smartlock, so I wouldn't necessarily go as far as you seem to want to go with unifying everything under minimal brands/ecosystems.

If you want to avoid subscriptions, I suggest trying Wyze cameras. They are dirt cheap ($20!) and have no subscription. You can store images locally on a memory card ($10) and it will upload motion to the cloud for free. They are testing an outdoor model and a battery model (I think) as I type. I use the indoor model out in the open (under roofs) and it works great there too. 

Depending on how big of a house/property, I may alter some of my suggestions, but I would stick to my guns on choosing Insteon. I have implemented at three houses I have owned. It has been a great solution for me.

By the way, Amazon is selling the Google WiFi OnHub by TP-Link for $75\~ right now. So, you can get a mesh network for very little coin.

But, here's the thing: Google Assistant is a user interface, it is not some sort of ecosystem to build around.  They're trying to make it one by making Nest exclusive to them, but that's all that they sell - not tons of products.  Not to mention, you're talking about enough devices that your consumer WiFi, or Google WiFi, will buckle under the load of it if they were all WiFi and talking directly to Google.  Go on, count how many light switches you have and remember that your router subnet can hold 253 client devices, and each WAP can handle 25-50 (a full mesh network *maybe* 100 under ideal circumstances) before it starts to slow down significantly. ;)

So, if your requirement is simply, ""Works with Google,"" then that's a very, very long list, even if I just listed the good products it would be pages and pages.  95% of what works with Alexa, also works with Google.  So, before you jump feet first into this, take a minute, and plan.  Write down everything you want, how you want it to work, and work backwards from the result to find the right products for *your* home. 

There are three major HA protocols that get around the WiFi limitations by using different frequency bands and their own protocols designed from the ground up for HA.  You then purchase an automation controller that can speak to one (or all) of them, and purchase devices that work on each.  They are: Insteon, Z-Wave, and ZigBee, and each have their own advantages and disadvantages.  Insteon offers a dual mesh network, powerline+RF that's extremely reliable, and direct device links means instant response and that if the controller fails your basic automations and local controls all still work; they also have a number of unique products, such as keypads, DIN rail dimmers, micro modules, etc, and a full suite of sensors, and can expand larger than your house (notably, they're used by the British embassy in DC).  Z-Wave has a 232 device upper limit, is routed RF only, and practical limits start coming in well before that, but they offer good security and a number of unique devices, including load controllers, some odd sensors, and door locks.  ZigBee is very low power, extremely fast sensor response, and very robust, but almost nobody speaks the same language when it comes to ZigBee; ZigBee is are what Hue and TRADFRI use, and you're usually best off getting a hub for any ZigBee system.

All of these protocols also keep working when the internet goes down: which is indeed important, because it does happen.

Once you've determined all of what you want to automate, then you can decide what central controller you want.  I went with an ISY994iZW: it does work with Google (though I don't do that), and lets me use a huge list of Insteon and Z-Wave devices in my home: Insteon for lighting and lighting sensors, Z-Wave for load controllers, door locks, and the like.",1565791195,ewutdd1,t3_cq3ci2,t3_cq3ci2,/r/homeautomation/comments/cq3ci2/new_home_so_i_need_new_googlecompatible_gear/ewutdd1/,1,homeautomation

AmosRatchetNot,"How very naive of you.  


First off, there are numerous IP address locator services just a google search away that will easily tell anybody that wants to look what city a person is in. Any outbound traffic to a cloud server is going to reveal that IP address. So that first step is incredibly easy. Skilled hackers can easily reduce that down to neighborhoods in many cases if not an exact address - sometimes by following other IP address tracking methods such as postings on popular websites that track such things - and MANY DO!  


Next, many people have exterior cameras as well that can reveal other things like street names, address, or even license plates of vehicles registered to them. It takes less than a minute to get the name and address of a vehicle owner. No hacking needed. Pay a few bucks and the information is theirs just for asking.

Also, what can you claim about Wyze security with it's own servers and intranet? Are they completely secure? Or are they like countless other startups with barely a handle on the day to day operations, much less actively engaged in updating and fixing patches on a daily basis? Would they know if they got hacked at all? Would they reveal it if they did?  


Smart hackers try very hard to leave no trace of their activities. Breeches can go on for months or longer without people discovering them. But sure, major operations never get hacked either, right? The long list of retailers, banks, and other financial institutions that have admitted to such breeches escapes me, but they are just the ones we know about.

Lastly, it is clear that you do not have children or don't value their internet safety. They run around naked, and when I am home alone, maybe out of soap for the shower or needing toilet paper from another bathroom, I run around naked as well. It does not matter. It is my business to do as I please in my own home, and I know that I am not the exception. It's trite to suggest anything abnormal here.

jec6613,"In the construction phase, run CAT6 or CAT6A everywhere, and have the electrician certify the runs.  4 behind each TV, 2 to each WAP location, 1 to each on-wall control panel location and camera location.  Bring it back to patch panel a wiring closet with dedicated circuits and proper cooling to handle everything you're putting there.  Then run in-wall speaker wire from in-wall speakers in every audio zone back to the same location: dumb speakers and good amplifiers are the best choice here.  For lighting: Wire as per usual, unless you want centralized lighting panels on DIN rails, which is a commercial install.

Onto DIY products: it depends on how automated you want things.  For large installs, the general rule is to use either Lutron RA2 or Insteon for the lighting.  Insteon is certainly more DIY-friendly and less expensive, and has the benefit of more flexible programming and many more devices (DIN Rail, Micro Module, etc), as well as their own sensors that can direct link to devices for instant response, but they both make very high quality products.

For everything that isn't Insteon, use Z-Wave.  This keeps you handily under the 232 device Z-Wave limit (my Insteon network is well over that, and it's 95% lighting), and provides for their unique devices: door locks, 240V load controllers, and so on, while keeping the device count low enough to not introduce Z-Wave lag.  You can even get Z-Wave thermostats - they're not as sexy as Ecobee or Nest, but there's zero cloud reliance and they're all just as capable, and since they're Z-Wave they can actually be much smarter than the usual suspects.

For security, with a UL listed system (which gets you a discount on your insurance) your choices are mostly Elk or to hire a company to do it for you (those are not mutually exclusive, you can do both with an Elk M1 Gold).  Since you're building from scratch: run hardwired sensors.  They're cheaper, more reliable, and just better overall.  An Elk system can then be bridged to a capable HA controller, so that you can trigger from its sensors and its state, as well as arm the system from the HA controller - disarming must of course be done by the security system for security reasons.

For cameras.  The usual recommendation is Blue Iris on a home built NVR, as it can integrate into any number of automation systems and use a variety of cameras.  You can also pick up a commercial NVR, which is going to be somewhat less expensive but also less capable.

Lastly comes the automation controller.  Once you've chosen everything else, you need a controller that will speak to everything, and there are really two that fit the bill with full customization and enough power to handle it all: ISY994iZW Pro with Polyglot, or [HASS.io](https://HASS.io) running on a NUC (or you can integrate both if you want to).  The ISY994 runs a custom RTOS and is very, very fast, a perfect set it and forget it automation system with bulletproof reliability, wtih integrations into Elk and hundreds of other products.  [HASS.io](https://HASS.io) is more for the tinkerer, but has a lovely UI, but on large setups tends to become quite laggy as it's built entirely on Python.  Even a quad core Xeon couldn't solve the lagging problem with [HASS.io](https://HASS.io) running everything in a half built out 2600 sq foot home.  Or, of course, you can split them and run the UI and some devices on [HASS.io](https://HASS.io) and the main automation on an ISY994 - a not uncommon configuration, though definitely for the tinkerer rather than anything else.",1565631474,ewp1lzb,t3_cpfc5k,t3_cpfc5k,/r/homeautomation/comments/cpfc5k/new_home_construction_home_automation_options/ewp1lzb/,1,homeautomation
DavidAg02,"The direction you take for smart home equipment depends entirely upon how far down the rabbit hole you think you want to go.

If you just want to do a thermostat, a few lights and a door lock or two, then Google Home or Alexa will be fine. If you'd like to take your automation and device control even farther, then you'll want to look into the true home automation hubs like SmartThings, Hubitat, Home Assistant, etc. You'll use that to control all your devices and create automations, and you can pair whatever hub you choose with whichever voice assistant you use to make all those devices and automations have voice commands that activate them as well.

In my house, I have over 80 devices controlled by a SmartThings hub, using Google Home as my voice assistant. Every device has 3 (or more) methods of control: physical (switch/button/remote), voice commands, or through the SmartThings app on my phone or tablet.

For door locks, I use Kwikset Z-Wave. Security, I use the wired sensors that came with the house but are now paired to a Konnected alarm panel and wired PoE cameras that record to an on-site DVR with cloud backup. Lights are mostly GE Z-Wave switches and dimmers, with the occasional lamp plugged into a Z-Wave plug or outlet. For thermostats, I went with Ecobee 3 Lites. Garage door is a Chamberlain MyQ. My setup does not require any monthly fees.

It really just depends on what level of control you want. The true home automation hubs like I mentioned will allow you much greater functionality when it comes to automation. For example, I have a ""Goodbye"" routine that senses when I've left the house and in response it: locks my doors, closes my garage, turns off my lights, adjusts the A/C, makes sure all my media equipment is turned off, sends me a text message if I've left any windows or doors open, activates the security system and several other things. When I get back home I have a routine that does the exact opposite so everything is just the way I like it when I walk through the door. That's the real power of a home automation system, and smart speakers like Echo/Google Home just aren't at that level yet.",1565631189,ewp15vj,t3_cpfc5k,t3_cpfc5k,/r/homeautomation/comments/cpfc5k/new_home_construction_home_automation_options/ewp15vj/,1,homeautomation

Right now, to talk to the ecobee, it connect to the web api, same goes for myq and I'm pretty sure the same goes for the wemo switch. The only direct is my security system. Is it possible to have all of this with either openhab or homeassistant? I don't have any zigbee or whatever, I'm a heavy WiFi user.

jec6613,"No, just that sometimes that using examples like auto manufacturers leads to very obvious counter-arguments.  And I think JD uses 6 keys for all of its equipment, my small lawn tractor's key will turn on any lawn tractor they make.

The heavy equipment is more an example of why enterprise security is the way it is.  Ford offers to key all of their police interceptors alike for fleet management, for example, and BMW does the same in their home market and would offer the same for overseas markets if you inquired.  Similarly, enterprise products all ship with a common credential, so that it can be automatically disabled by any competent sysadmin or netadmin, in bulk, for automatic configuration.

Most businesses when set up properly have a highly secured backdoor credential(s) that only a few people have access to and can only be used from limited workstations which require centralized logon, and then every other credential is presented by individual users in a secure, centralized manner, using LDAPS, Kerberos, or other authentication method.

In the consumer space, the practice is very different, but all of the consumer devices I've seen over the last 3-5 years or so have had a unique credential usually stamped or stickered onto the device itself, or are set up such that physical access is required for initial admin setup, or for claiming admin access from a lost credential.

Granto86,"This was helpful thank you. I can get a little more specific about what I’m trying to accomplish. I just moved into an older house that doesn’t have a neutral wire so a lot of my automation options are limited. I’ve put in a couple philips hue bulbs around, so I have that hub. I have several amazon echos around the house as well, but not the one that acts as hub. How tech/code savvy do you have to be to use openhab or smartthings?

What I envision for these sensors is that yeah, they notify my smartphone any time the door is opened (do you set them to “on” when you leave or something?) it would also be good if there was something that made an alarm sound if they doors were open when we weren’t home. From what I’ve gathered the aqara gateway can do this, but there are multiple threads on here warming either not to use the hub/gateway (are they the same thing?) for security reasons or find a way to block it from using internet with something like mqtt2zigbee or something like that. But I’m not sure how that works. 

The more expensive route I started looking at was the Ring Alarm system. That seems to do what I would like, the downsides are that it’s much more expensive than cheap aqara sensors and I just installed a nest hello doorbell and nest thermostat. So not sure if I want both nest and ring products. And I’ve read the nest secure system isn’t that great. 

I also might eventually want to add more nest cameras to the inside or outside of my house, which I just read costs more money with each camera you add, so that’s annoying. 

I’d also like to maybe add smart locks down the road, especially to the door inside the garage where we use the most that is generally unlocked most of the time.",1565192008,ew7hp0t,t3_cm7l2r,t1_ew6a4u9,/r/homeautomation/comments/cm7l2r/recommendations_for_windowdoor_sensors/ew7hp0t/,1,homeautomation

jotunck,"While most smart devices run on wireless communication, the reason for neutral is because most smart switches need a neutral line, so if you intend to use them or might want them in future you should pull neutrals to your points first. Smart switches are cheaper overall (since one switch can control many bulbs) and avoid the ""nothing works because someone physically turned off the switch"" problem, but you won't get the colour changing or dimming capabilities of smart bulbs. 

Other than that, probably try to plan where everything will be placed and pull the appropriate infrastructure (Ethernet to where your hub and routers will be, sockets for any plug-in devices, etc there.

Some security cams run on battery, check the system you're planning to get so you know if you need to get a socket where you intend to put them.

And make sure all of your planned smart devices will work with each other. Generally z-wave devices should all work with one z-wave hub, but Zigbee devices may not. Of course you probably don't want to be mixing Zigbee and z-wave devices.

sethdaniel2011,"In the interest of anyone who finds this post later, I'll post my experiences with moving from SmartThings to Home Assistant.

Smart devices I have: Door/window sensors, motion sensors, Hue lights, light switches and plugs

In SmartThings I used these to do several automation-related things easily:

1. Turn on lights at sunset
2. Set bedroom lights to dim when there was motion in the bedroom around bed time
3. Automatically arm the alarm system and turn on the camera when everyone left
4. Automatically disarm the alarm system and turn off the camera when someone came home
5. Have Neato Robot Vacuum clean when everyone is gone.

In addition I spent a significant amount of time setting up and understanding webcore and hacking stuff together to get the following:

1. Notification if windows are closed and it's colder outside during summer or vice versa (windows open warmer in summer)
2. Delay some number of seconds after a contact sensor triggers before triggering alarm
3. Flash lights and change colors when intrusion is detected
4. Send pre-recorded audio files to Google home - though this was flaky at best and required a separate device running a node.js script all the time

In Home Assistant I can do these things easily:

1. Turn on lights at sunset
2. Set bedroom lights to dim when there was motion in the bedroom around bed time
3. Notification if windows are closed and it's colder outside during summer or vice versa (windows open warmer in summer)
4. Turn the camera on when everyone leaves, off when someone comes home
5. Actually control Google Homes easily

In Home Assistant I have to write custom apps or more complex things for the following:

1. Create an alarm system, arm it when everyone leaves, disarm when someone comes home
2. Flash lights when alarm detected until it disarmed

In general, the security stuff has been somewhat more complicated, as it's not built in to Home Assistant. There are some community-developed solutions, but they all require quite a bit of digging into the code and customizing to your own use. However, it's much easier to create a useful, usable UI in Home Assistant than in SmartThings. For SmartThings I had to purchase a different app that integrates with it and is hosted on different servers, then set up each tile and sign into a different thing on each device, and the loading was always slow. Home Assistant's lovelace has a lot of power. To get it looking pretty takes a bit of effort, but just a usable interface is very simple and much faster.

Overall, each system has it's advantages and disadvantages. SmartThings strict use of SmartPhone for everything is frustrating for me, as I enjoy being able to sit down with a larger screen to do real work in the Home Automation. Home Assistant's lack of a basic built-in security app is a glaring omission for me.

I did have to buy a Z-wave and ZigBee stick separately and set them up in Home Assistant to use my devices. The interface for adding and removing devices isn't quite as expressive in HA as it is in SmartThings, so I found myself going to the logs frequently - but it is easy to actually get to the logs, so I didn't mind too much.

Personally, I'll be sticking with Home Assistant for most things - though I may still use SmartThings for some things (haven't yet been able to get Neato working with Home Assistant). The first time I adjusted the brightness on a light and it was instant was magical.

YaztromoX,"There are a few problems with ""smart"" home devices which use their own apps:

1. The devices generally can't inter-communicate between apps.  So if you have an app that can handle a motion sensor and some lights, and a separate app that controls your thermostat, you won't be able to have an automation that detects when motion is detected to turn on some lights _and_ set the temperature.  The devices basically live in their own app silo, and don't talk to anything outside that silo.
2. Hubless smart devices typically use TCP/IP directly to deal with command and control over the Internet.  This can be highly insecure, and may mean you need to punch a bunch of holes in your firewall to talk to them from outside the home.  These devices often have highly insecure firmware, and a determined hacker can use them to break into your network.  And even if they don't, having lots of devices on WiFi increase the noise floor and chance of packet collisions, and can effectively slow down your WiFi for everything.
3. Without a hub, your smart phone is effectively a fancy multi-app remote control.  What happens when you leave your home with your phone, and there are other people in your home?  You now have nothing in your home to control automations.

In contrast, using a smart home hub allows the hub to control _everything_, and it can do some really cool things.  People have setup automations where when they open a window, their air conditioning automatically shuts down.  Or when the light level hits a certain threshold, lights dim or turn off and curtains open.  Or you might have an automation whereby when you arrive home (using your phone as a location sensor) at night, outside and appropriate indoor lights turn on, and when you leave your entertainment centre turns itself off, your thermostat adjusts the temperature (to use less energy, so up or down depending on the season and whether you are heating or cooling), and lights will turn off after some delay.

As well, smart devices that connect to your hub will likely use the Z-Wave or ZigBee protocols.  Devices that use the latest Z-Wave spec are highly secure, and don't connect to the Internet directly -- they _only_ connect to the hub, inside your own network.  They are invisible to the Internet at large.  Only your home hub is connected to the Internet directly, and because of this most home hubs have better security in their firmware.

Hubless can work for very, very, very simple situations and automations, but gets unwieldily as soon as you need different things to talk to one another.  A hub that can talk to _everything_ can do a whole lot more and act much, much smarter.

For video doorbells, Eufy Security makes a doorbell cam with 4GB (non-expandable) local storage, though I can't vouch for how well it works, but I believe it will stream to a Google/Nest Home Hub and Chromecast, so you might check into that if that's important to you. You should be able to find it on Amazon and it's $159 here in the US. It doesn't appear to integrate with SmartThings at this time, but it'll work fine with Google Assistant, which is totally fine for a video doorbell. Not everything has to integrate completely, but luckily between SmartThings and Google Assistant, pretty much 99% of devices will be covered in some way if you use both. Hope that helps.",1564915948,evxzk1r,t3_clsyjh,t1_evxvd6u,/r/homeautomation/comments/clsyjh/using_nest_secure_abroad/evxzk1r/,1,homeautomation
latexfistmassacre,"I'm gonna tell you right now, Wyze products have been EXTREMELY unreliable and are just too buggy for me to recommend for your specific use case. I have the Wyze Pan Cam, a regular Wyze Cam v2, and a Wyze Cam v1, integrated with a Google Home/Assistant and a Nest Hub. First off, I never get motion detection notifications. Ever. I've reset the cameras, uninstalled/reinstalled the Wyze app, disabled battery optimization features in Android, and even went as far as hard resetting my phone and trying a different phone altogether. Best result I got was getting about 5 out of every 10 notifications, and that lasted about a week, followed by no more notifications. And I'm am extremely technically savvy person. It's just not reliable enough for security purposes. Secondly, the Google Assistant integration barely works. I am able to link my Wyze account to Google Assistant and get it to show a feed on my Nest Home Hub, my phone, and all of my Chromecasts. However, something happens about every week where I am no longer able to view the feed and have to unlink my account and relink it and assign it to a room again. Also, when it does work, the video has anywhere from a 10 second to 1 minute delay. Wyze Cams are fine for checking in from time to time, but they're just not reliable. Cheap, yes. But you get what you pay for. If I had to do it over again, I'd get something different, like maybe those Logitech Circle cams (which I believe are Google Assistant compatible and Nest Home Hub compatible). I don't have experience with the Wyze door sensors, but am willing to assume their notification system operates the same as their cameras. Personally, I just started using a Samsung Smartthings hub with SmartThings door/motion sensors and smart plugs, and they have been working flawlessly. They also integrate with Google Assistant, so you can still use voice commands to control them, plus they integrate with my Phillips Hue hub and bulbs as well as any Zigbee bulbs out there (i.e.: Sengled, LIFX, etc). I know I'm probably getting off topic, but maybe consider something besides Wyze, and definitely look into SmartThings- it adds a whole new level of customizability and compatibility to your smart home, and offers a wide selection of devices to pick from since it natively supports Zigbee, Z Wave, and Z Wave Plus and integrates nicely with Google Assistant and Echo. Finally, I have an August 3rd Gen smart lock and it works well. But if you go the SmartThings route down the road, get the August Smart Lock Pro (which is Z Wave compatible, and will integrate better with SmartThings, as well as Google Assistant). Whew!

There are several, but on the other hand I don't use them since I want my outdoor lights to always come on: it's a home security thing and generally keeps people from casing your property after dark.  As for the devices, you'll want a wire in module: either replace the switch and add a paired motion detector (e.g. Insteon) or add a motion detector to your existing floods (e.g. HomeSeer), but either way, re-wiring for outdoor is by far the best way.

redlotusaustin,"Don't go with the Google smart home stuff, other than as an interface to Home Assistant, since it can do almost everything that you listed, when combined with Blue Iris, MQTT and Node Red.

You're definitely talking about a complicated setup, but not an impossible one. Breaking down what you listed:

**My security camera spots motion and recognizes it as person (not a blowing leaf or a shadow) walking onto my front porch** - Connect almost any IP camera to Blue Iris &amp; configure Blue Iris to send a message over MQTT when it detects motion on a camera. Configure Home Assistant to watch for those messages and, when it sees them, to grab a screenshot from the camera, then pass it to TensorFlow to see if it's a person.

**The person’s presence there at that hour triggers my exterior security lights to switch from dim to full bright. My digital assistant announces that someone is on my front porch, and the digital display in my kitchen automatically picks up the live feed from my security camera.** - If TensorFlow reports that it is a person, turn on the exterior security lights, send a notification to a speaker/Google Home/Google Hub, then use the [Home Assistant Cast](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2019/07/09/home-assistant-cast-preview/) feature to stream the camera feed from Blue Iris.

**I watch the person walk to my doorbell cam and ring the button. I hear the chime and the digital display automatically switches to the live video/audio from the doorbell cam. I hear and see the person announce themselves through the kitchen digital display.** - Configure Home Assistant to listen for a button press on the doorbell (a DIY doorbell/camera combo might be easiest to get to do what you want) and, when it senses one, use the HA Cast feature to change the camera to the doorbell cam (I think DoorBird is the only camera that you can get a true feed from, but the picture isn't that great).

**I respond out loud that I’ll be there in a second. My doorbell near instantaneously repeats my message to the person at the front door. I wash my hands and answer the door. All is well.** - This is the least ""done"" of anything you've listed, but you could always create a routine in the Google Home app which triggers an automation in HA to send a message to the speaker at the door.

DavidAg02,"The level of integration you're wanting doesn't currently exist, but I think we are on the way to being there. I have something that works kind of like you're wanting.

For example, I have SmartThings motion sensors mounted on the front and back of my house. If either of those detect motion during a certain time of day or when the house is in Away mode, SmartThings sends a notification to my phone and a few tablets I have around the house.

I then use an app called AutoNotification which can detect when that specific SmartThings notification appears and it will automatically open the app for my security cameras (Swann Security). It would be really simple to add automations that when when motion is detected, my lights respond in a certain way... I just haven't done that. I have something similar setup where if someone rings my doorbell it turns on the inside lights that lead to my front door. 

Regarding your number 5... I think the exact opposite of what you are suggesting. In my experience, you are much more likely to get a fully integrated home by using a true home automation hub like SmartThings, Home Assistant, Hubitat, etc. than you are with something like Google. Keep this in mind... Google Home, Amazon Echo, etc. are primarily voice assistants, with some device control functionality added on. Their focus is not on device integration, it's on the voice assistant.

SirEDCaLot,"&gt; repeat AND amplify the signal. The Jasco plug will repeat the signal

Same thing.  

You can't amplify the signal while it's already in the air, that's not a thing.  ANY repeater device for any radio tech is just re-transmitting the same signal from its own antenna.  So that way, base transmits a signal, repeater receives the signal, repeater re-transmits the same signal.  

Thus, even if the remote device can't hear the base's signal, it CAN hear the repeater's signal sent a few milliseconds later.  

Also, beaming is not a secure Z-Wave tech.  It's usually used for door locks, but it's separate from security.  
Beaming is designed to let battery powered devices receive Z-Wave signals.  
In most cases, a battery powered device like a handheld controller will shut down its radio most of the time to save power.  If you push a button it wakes up, transmits, waits for the confirmation, then shuts down again.  Then once every so often (usually once a day) it wakes up and 'checks in' with the network to see if any traffic is waiting for it (parameter settings etc), then goes back to sleep.  This is all fine for a handheld controller that will rarely or never need to actually receive anything.  
A door lock however is different.  Door lock is battery powered, but needs to receive and act on commands.  That's what beaming does.  The door lock will shut down its radio most of the time, then wake up in receive-only mode once every second or so to listen for any commands.  The 'beam' is that the same signal for the device is continually re-transmitted for whatever the beam interval is (usually about one second) until the device acknowledges receipt.  
Since a Z-wave message is very short (only a few milliseconds), this saves a ton of power- the radio can be shut off for 900 out of every 1000 milliseconds.  However it means any repeater has to be beaming-capable- the repeater can get a beamed message, and know to continually re-transmit it until it's acknowledged.  

Security is protocols like S0 or the newer S2 which encrypt Z-Wave communications, but that's about scrambling the content of the message, not about retransmitting the message.",1564582009,evkihmk,t3_ck8d0l,t1_evkbvhi,/r/homeautomation/comments/ck8d0l/dedicated_zwave_repeater_vs_zwave_plug/evkihmk/,1,homeautomation
BreakfastBeerz,"/u/jec6613 had a great response, to which I agree with almost completely.  The only thing I would say is that I think his use of ""ecosystem"" is incorrect in #4.  I would say he intended to use the word ""wireless protocol"" instead.  The ""ecosystem"" would be the hub controller, SmartThings, Hubitat, Home Assistant, ect.  And you DO (with some arguable exceptions) need to lock yourself into those ecosystems.  This makes his ""step on"" comment even more important.  Without the plan, and knowing exactly what you are getting into, you're running the very real risk of painting yourself in a corner and having a mess of an automation network.  I've seen it happen dozens of times in this sub.

To answer your question directly:

I have SmartThings.

Pros: 

Hub is managed by cloud services.  All maintenance, updates, security patches, etc is handled by Samsung.  If bugs pop up or there are other failures, someone else fixes it, not you.  You plug it into the wall, and forget about it.

It's supported by a wide range of devices, pretty much any zigbee or zwave device and a decent number of wifi devices.  

A fairly large user community so you can get help pretty easily if you need it

The ability to develop your own apps and automations, even more so with WebCore.

Cons: 

Hub is managed by cloud services.  While its getting more and more local, many things require cloud execution vs local.  If you ever lose internet service, you lose your automations too.

There are only a few things that are supported right out of the box.  SmartThings is a developer oriented platform, you're expected to develop the solutions and integrations on your own.

SirEDCaLot,"First- if you do ANYTHING regarding security, get a liability waiver and ideally some insurance.  It's not expensive.  

Reason being- if you set up a smart door lock or a security camera, and it doesn't work right (doesn't record a robbery, unlocks at the wrong time, locks and won't unlock when they need to get in, etc) you don't want to be on the hook for paying for their locksmith or getting a lawsuit.  

Also, in many places if you do any work on door locks or alarms or cameras you have to get a security license.  This isn't common just double check first.  

Second- keep in mind, if you do this you will be the first person they call whenever anything goes even a little bit wrong.  It's 8pm on a Sunday and their TV doesn't work?  LETS CALL /u/churchodavids REPEATEDLY UNTIL (S)HE ANSWERS!!!11  Selling them a product (whether or not payment is involved) means they will expect you to support it.  This isn't a bad thing, but you should be careful to set your customer expectations as to how quickly you'll address issues.  

But if you are going to do this, I suggest either charge by the project or by the hour.  

For this sort of work, I suggest assume your time is worth MINIMUM $30/hr.  So figure out how many hours it takes on average to do a project, add in a bit for unexpected problems, and that's your job quote.  

I suggest for setting up a plex server, and setting up some basic home automation, NOT including running any wires, $200-$350 is a good bottom end price.  You can probably charge much more if you're good.",1564523386,evhalbq,t3_cjxrsa,t3_cjxrsa,/r/smarthome/comments/cjxrsa/no_idea_how_much_to_charge/evhalbq/,1,smarthome

weiqj,"I re-wrote every line of the protocol. I can say I know both protocols very well.

First of all, Hornet keeps structure of message format of Zigbee in every layer, including MAC, NWK and APS. So they arevery similar to each other.

I would not call my protocol Zigbee. It is not even certified with Zigbee. Instead I named it Hornet.

1. **Security** \- Hornet security is more trust-center oriented. Because trust-center is the one you have to trust and you don't have to trust any other nodes at all. Unlike Zigbee that pretty much only relies on NWK key, Hornet has unique link-keys for every pair of devices. So security is beefed up to maximum.

2. **Routing** \- I will have more room to improve routing related protocols. Making route management more robust and improve system capacity to thousands of nodes.

3. **Management** \- Especially device join process. Zigbee device join process is disgusting and there is no hope to count on them to improve. I introduces several extra messages to facilitate joining, that improves both security (X25519 key exchange) and user experience (average user will have the patience and confidence in device join process)

3. **APS Layer** \- There is no way for Zigbee APS layer to cover the complex user requirement and innovations. So if we want to give user optimal experience, we need to roll out own devices and nobody will support those except us anyway.

One simple example, is the Level Control. If the level control is bound to a speaker volume, for example, a remote button, or a switch on the way, you don't want a simple click ""turn on"" to product loudest sound in your room :) In another word, the switch has to be ""Step only"".",1564331401,ev9u8xb,t3_ciwtuw,t1_ev9ri7a,/r/smarthome/comments/ciwtuw/introducing_libre_home_smart_home_designed_for/ev9u8xb/,1,smarthome

There's a bit of a learning curve but it's getting better and easier with each update. Now with their nabucasa service it can be accessed remotely with good security while not opening any ports in my firewall.

I like it a lot. If you can get passed the learning curve it's really powerful.

Then you'll get tired of the cloud dependence.  You'll want something that works 100% of the time even if the power or internet goes out.  You'll take the gained knowledge and look into Hubitat or Home assistant.  With a back up power supply, you'll be happy knowing the leak sensors, contact sensors, sirens, etc will all continue to work.  Even when the internet goes out, your lights can still be controlled.

1) doesn't crowd your wifi 
2) better battery life (wifi drains batteries)
3) better security (wifi devices like to dial to china)
4) don't need an app for every different device
5) better integration between devices (use a motion sensor to turn off your lights)

phynixx,"Not sure what you've got for budget, or how frual you are, but I've already wanted a few things...

1.) Per outlet, it even socket, power control and monitoring.

I fu*kin love data and control. And if had the ability to know what's draining what juice, what caused a break, etc. It wld be awesome.

Heard of a few systems that let you know &amp;/or monitor at the panel each circuit. Gives you a real good idea on drain. And this was years ago.

Wouldn't be surprised if there's now more than just that out there. I'd you at all care, now would be the time!


2.) Monitoring/ control of my major cost centers. People talk about Ethernet to rooms etc. But don't forget the proliferation of smart appliances. Consider how you may need / want to wire a smart fridge / stove / washer / dryer. 

Also consider things like water or CO or other monitoring in your furnace area. Things are a simple wired water monitor to alert at the first sign of a leak could really save money. That, connected to something that might automatically cut off water could really go a long while.
So, consider beyond living areas what might need wiring.


3.) Mesh wireless. It's becoming cheaper faster easier. Think how you might want too do it (i.e. where would be ideal, remembering that brands and products will evolve but the density of walls and floorplan of the house probably won't.


4.) On the note of #3, but possibly on its own as well: consider fibre. If you're trying to future-proof remember everything gets faster over time. What might the lifespan of Ethernet be, and will the next fastest medium be fibre, wireless, or...?

At a minimum though, if you can get fibre to the home you know your upper bandwidth threshold well be high, so keep it in mind and what that might look like.


5.) Security systems. They're _finally_ evolving beyond the archaic dumb switches ""monitored"" by big outdated companies like ADT. Even if you don't trust having a ""smart"" home security system (understandable), consider where the market is going and how you can future proof your wiring.

This will probably, again, come down to laying more Cat 6 :) but whatever you decide, just make it a conscious decision. Unlike some other home changes you night so later on, it's rare you'll ever have the opportunity to do any kind of wiring that would go to your doors and windows.

6.) Your garage. You might turn this into and number of functional spaces so just consider what it might evolve into and lay enough cat 6 to accommodate.

This will probably be the easiest thing to fix later on tho.

bk553,"I agree that switching phones isn't likely to happen a lot.  My larger point (that I failed to get across) is the lock in works both ways.  If you rely on HomeKit (which seems like it works well), that also means you can only buy Homekit stuff.  It means that you are ""locked in"" to devices approved by Apple.  That DOES mean it will just work, be simply to add, etc. but it also means someone else determines what you can do.  I like tinkering and adding cheap esp8266s for things like checking if a car is in the garage or monitoring the temperature in the kids rooms.  Sure, you can $60 sensors for that, but I like making them and refining them.  I like that I can use anything, over any protocol, using any device.   I can switch between Google Assistant or Alexa.  I can add my security camers and do local AI for person recognition.  I can add any camera, from any manufacturer, and have it all local.  

&amp;#x200B;

Lock in isn't just the phone, its decisions that affect what other decisions and options you make.  Apple is notorious in limiting options for the sake of simplicity, and it's a tradeoff I don't like having to make.

Scrapes TVGuide data from schedulesdirect and creates a TVGuide on the ipad.  When you select a show on the guide it scrapes the web for data on the show, presents fanart/poster description and if it's a movie will let you play the movie trailer.

ChekovsWorm,"Caséta dimmer sometimes doesn't work for fan lights, due to the US-required wattage limiter in ceiling fan light fixtures. Guess how I know.

The $100 pro version of the Caséta dimmer, which requires a neutral wire, might work, because it doesn't have to trickle power through the bulbs to keep the radio powered up. But it's stupid expensive compared to the regular (no neutral) Caséta, already expensive at about $55 (plus expensive Lutron hub) compared to other smart dimmers.

Sengled bulbs will work fine, but you have to have the wall switch for the light left on, of course. Or light/fan both if only one switch.

If you can put regular E26 base bulbs like Sengled in the fan lamp fixture, that may mean it predates the 2008 regulation that enforced the watt limiter and E12 candelabra base bulbs. In which case the Caséta dimmer would work (with regular dimmable LED bulbs, not smart bulbs.) But the Sengled bulbs are cheaper.

I ended up with Sengled bulbs in my two older ceiling fans that take E26 normal bulbs. Put a Wi-Fi based TP-Link Kasa dimmer (needs neutral, only about $35) on the lights for the newer watt-limiter candelabra-bulb fan, after two Caséta  units didn't work even with incandescent. Once turned off, couldn't turn on. With the cheapo Kasa, works fine with my LEDs.

Many people have just a simple ring doorbell or other brand, their experience would not be reflective of the people who have to deal with hubs and multiple standards for lighting, heating and security needs.

gnuoyedonig,"It’s probably an unpopular opinion, but I think video doorbells are overrated. It’s been my one recent technology mistake.

I installed a Ring Video Doorbell 2, because like you, I felt Ring “seemed” like a standard. I know the Pro resolves a few of my issues because it’s continuously recording but even with those resolved, there’s a critical flaw with the doorbell...

Since I installed it, everyone has stopped using the doorbell and now they knock instead. Friends have stopped using it because they feel it’s a hassle for me when it’s just them, while strangers definitely give it a look and make a decision not to be on video (even though they already are because of motion sensitivity.) I’ve been the only person to use it since installation 4 months ago. So if you’re buying it to conveniently answer the door when home or away - it may be disappointing.  

Even worse when I’ve tested it, the delay between the time of the doorbell button press, to receiving a notification on my phone and then clicking it to start up the Ring app and then for it to begin showing video takes too long - I doubt anyone would wait around.

I think a good change in doorbell products would be a doorbell that doesn’t look like a camera hanging on the entryway, so the visitor doesn’t immediately become self conscious.

From looking at the Neighborhood posts I think the doorbells are effective for recording  package thieves and other people who have no reason to be there, but that’s not what I thought I was buying and there are security cameras that are more effective for that.

Everyone’s different of course, but I wish I understood this before I bought mine.  I’d rather go back to the plain doorbell.",1563292256,etx5xwa,t3_cdxy1h,t3_cdxy1h,/r/homeautomation/comments/cdxy1h/buy_a_ring_video_doorbell_pro_for_prime_day_or/etx5xwa/,2,homeautomation

jaya212,"You could just run everything on a VLAN with a VPN if you're concerned with security. You wouldn't have to make any sacrifices and would still be secure.

With smart home stuff, there's a couple things you've got to realise. One, if someone who knows what they're doing wants to hack you, you're going to get hacked. Obviously no normal person is going to be targeted by high level hackers like this. Two, you generally just have to be more secure than the average. The people who would go through with widespread attacks use vulnerabilities that aren't really advanced and won't have the resources to get more secure users. These are usually low level attacks meant to piss people off, or to use the devices in a DDoS network. Three, anytime you do something for convenience's sake, there are going to be security drawbacks. It's just a balancing act. 


Just make sure everything is purchased from reputable manufacturers, all of your accounts are secured and decide on how you want to set up your network. Having many devices that communicate to the internet separately increases the chance that something will get hacked, but it potentially lowers the amount of affected devices. If you go with Zigbee everything with a hub, there's less of a chance of it getting hacked, but if it does, everything is now compromised.

mcwhelan,"Take a hard look at Wyze.  Their main camera is $20 + shipping.  Great quality, does motion detection, and has IR for seeing in the dark.  You would need to have the app installed on your phone to set it up initially, but you could then uninstall it and just review the video from the SD card.  They are a US based company and make a point to not send your data off to China.  The camera doesn't have an internal web server so you would be forced to pull the SD card to review the video.  As far as motion alerts go, having the app on your phone would make it really easy, but Wyze does integrate w/ IFTTT, so you could get a regular text message from IFTTT when motion was detected.  It does have a free 14 day cloud storage account for motion clips that comes standard.  (Let me clarify, that's not a ""It's free for 14 days then they start charging you""  It's a ""They will retain your 12 second motion clips for 14 days before they are deleted"".  And they will do that forever.  For free.   If you want to retain the clips in the cloud for more than 14 days or want clips longer than 12 seconds then you can sign up for their storage.  But that option has only just debuted.   I think if you turn off event recording, then clips aren't sent to the cloud.  But that breaks the event notification I believe.  So you'd be left with having to watch a lot of video from the SD card w/ no way of telling what time of day you needed to watch.  I guess what I'm saying is, you can get the Wyze camera to do all the stuff you want but it's a lot of work to go through just because you don't trust an app. Considering you have the Ecobee, Weemo, and GH Mini, I wouldn't think it would be that big of a deal to leave the app on your phone and just force close it when you're not needing it.  Wyze seems to be a very open and honest company.  Go look at their user forums.  They disclose things other companies don't.  They value user input and implement tons of features that are suggested by users.  If I remember correctly, when the cameras first came out, they did some sort of check-in that went to an overseas server of some sort (I think it was Amazon's).  Users noticed it and were unhappy so they asked the company about it through the support forum.  Wyze told people what was up and released new firmware that stopped the communication.  I don't remember the exact details but I think it had something to do with Amazon's global storage network (which is who Wyze uses for cloud storage).  Anyway, I don't think I'm much of a fanboy (I have 2 of their cameras) but I really like the way the company treats it's customers.  The icing on the cake is that their products are really good and extremely inexpensive.",1574477977,f8d4fw4,t3_e09e11,t3_e09e11,/r/homeautomation/comments/e09e11/can_anyone_recommend_a_simple_motion_detection/f8d4fw4/,1,homeautomation

swoopy_puppy,"If you value your safety, stay away from cheap leds, I once bought a package of cheap Chinese mr16 led bulbs that were 10 times cheaper than Phillips branded ones. Luckily I installed them in my office where there is no carpet.

The first one went out with some fizzy noise about a month after installing it. Second and third ones died one week later about two days apart, but the fourth one died next weekend with a very loud bang and flash, lots of sparks and smoke, that alone could have started a fire very easily had it been near a curtain, shelf or sofa. After that incident I removed the other six remaining led bulbs, went to Home Depot and bought 10 Phillips mr16 led bulbs to replace them. It has been 3 years since that incident and my Phillips light bulbs work perfectly. Lesson learned! 

After that incident with the Chinese cheap leds I got scarred and to this day I don’t leave home with any led light on, particularly those above sofas, beds or carpet, contrary to old lightbulbs or cfl they don’t simply flash, they tend to explode during a surge and can easily spark a fire, are you sure you want to trust your home to your cheap leds??",1574071026,f7xr5tu,t3_dvfb7d,t3_dvfb7d,/r/smarthome/comments/dvfb7d/what_is_the_difference_between_smart_bulbs_like/f7xr5tu/,1,smarthome

kigmatzomat,"Join the homeseer forum. Lots of useful things there. Links to videos and the like.

The main thing is learning the event system. The UI is fairly straightforward but the notion of events re inherently complicated.

It uses an If (a becomes b and c becomes d) or (e becomes f and g becomes h) then set device I to status J.

It's all managed by dropdown menus so its fast...once you get used to thinking through your needs. 

There are times you will want to add a counter and a timer so you can set up an event after 3 things happen in 15 minutes. It's not hard to add timers or counters, it's hard to get the logic right.

Just start small. Make a few scenarios and run them for a week. Then add a bit more as you figure out what you forgot.

I will say with a thermostat you should be sure to define summer, winter and that comfortable window where no hvac is needed. 

Don't run your heat set point up against your cool set point. Most hvac systems overrun the target temp and have 2-3F of swing around their target temp.

Add some kind of override that if the temp ever goes over 85 that heat turns off or if the temp is below 60 that the AC turns off.

2: if power to the building goes out, everything reconnects and starts running again once the power comes back on. 
3: I could set the schedule to turn on and off intermittently throughout the day and be off at sunset and on at sunrise. And I could easily just turn it all off permanently  or back on to the schedule really easily from anywhere in the world. 
4: I trust GE brand more than some cheap chineses knock off. This is particularly important in the environment it is being used in. 
5: someday I might add some water sensors in some key areas.

&gt;October 24th, 2019: So… get out the tomatoes, pitchforks and anything else you’d like to throw at me as we are now expecting the dimmers to ship around November 10th. This is due to Quality Control catching an error in Group 2 &amp; 4’s Association. Then to top it off, the firmware engineer was in the hospital for a few days so he couldn’t fix the firmware until this past weekend. Let me explain further:

&gt;The dimmer switch can be directly associated to smart bulbs and Group 2 controls whether or not the bulb turns on or off, whereas Group 4 controls the dimming level. It was found that, while our switches can be associated with up to 5 devices, the associations were only working with one bulb (as opposed to 5).

&gt;Now that this is fixed, the dimmers are back in production and will be finalized by November 10th.

&gt;Very sorry for the delay and trust me, I am also very disappointed. But, on the plus side, I guess we know Quality Control works at the manufacturer (nervous laughter).",1572550674,f5y4g53,t3_dprzog,t3_dprzog,/r/homeautomation/comments/dprzog/inovelli_dimmers_preorder/f5y4g53/,1,homeautomation

nwanerka,"Honesty the best way is to go to a hub based smart home. Zigbee is ok and will do the job but zwave is truly the way to go. Wifi devices,no matter how good and strong your network and router are, will get bogged down. Zigbee and zwave both use the mesh network technology.  This works on a lover radio frequency and will not get caught up in the 2.4 or 5 bands. They only use the wifi to send in and out to there cloud based services so you can control them from your phone when your not home . 
If you can find a hub that will do both, then your in business.  But fair warning, most DIY systems work on a cloud based service.  So when your internet goes down, so does your smart home and then you have to get up and acually flip the switch.  Lol. But not all DIY systems are cloud based. 
You can go about this 1 ways.
1. DIY it! If your handy enough and dont mind changing out an electrical switch or outlet (disclaimer: hire a licensed electrician for all electrical work. I am one so I must say it...) but if you can do it yourself safely then pick a good DIY hub. 
Most of these choices I have tried and used in the begging of my home automation life. I have now graduated to the more professional systems and incorporated smart homes into my electrical contracting company.  So you can trust me when I say I'm not trying to sell one brand over the other :-)
Samsung smartthings is good, not sure if they do zigbee though. They definitely do zwave though.  I had smartthings for everyrhing in my home at one point. Switches, outlets, locks ect..  even my samsung fridge with the family hub and samsung connect oven were all controlled by it.  I still have smartthings but only for my fridge and oven now 

Hubitat Elevation is not to bad. I have not personally used it but from what I have read and talked to other, they all seam to like it. You have to know a little more than normal to set up but once it is all set up it's a breeze .

Wink hub 2 was great and they say there still in buisness, but stay away from them. Will I am bought them 2 years ago and they have not produced a single new hub in over a year.  They where great. With zwave, zigbee, bluetooth and even a lutron radio receiver built in so you did not need to buy a caseta hub. It was heaven. But like the dodo bird, you cant find a new hub anywhere and they arw sinking fast . I had them first and loved them. It was a sad day when I unplugged my hub

Zipatile by zipato:  My wife bought me a zipatile for Christmas a couple years ago because she knows I love touch screens. She did not know that it was its own smart home hub. I love her anyway. But I still tried it out and really liked it. It's and a beautiful touchscreen that had Z wave and zig be Built-in plus run dry contacts to it and a couple other cool things.    They are not based in the US so support is a little hard but if you go online if plenty of forums out there if you get stuck.  I had the 1st gen zipatile and even cracked it to run smartthings:-)  the new zipatile 2 is even better.  A great company to watch 

Now onto the the real fun.  If you want a system that can do everything and have a true smart home, then your going to have to go professional.  I know I will get a lot of slack on reddit for this, but its true.  I have tried and used many DIY hub systems but could never get everyrhing I wanted out of them. Plus being dependent on a cloud based service when the hub is in my house drove me nuts. 
I finally stepped it up for 2 reasons. First to help my company grow and offer better solutions to my customers and second,  With professional systems There is so many more choices for so many more cool stuff to add to your house. Touch screens galore that will make your head spin. Remotes that can do everything and anything.  Integrate with almost everything out there. Except Google nest since google bought them and shut down the works with nest.  Those rat bastards. 
1. The first one I choose and got certified in was control4. They are  Pretty good and do a lot but they had so many requirements to keep the certification up and I had to spend so much money a year no matter what that I didn't think it was worth it any snap AV just bought them and it's official and maybe things will change, but only time will tell.  (Side note; snapav.com is a online store for professionals, home owners can look but not touch. Hehe. You wont be able to see any pricing or be able to order from them but it's a good reference.  We buy from snapav on a ever 2 to 3 week base, they are great) but I left control4 and looked else where.  So many professional choices, where to begin....well

My number 1 choice and where I ended up is with URC Total control.  This company started 30 years ago making Universal remotes and now has grown into one of the largest power house home automation companies out there.   A lot of these other professional companies are Just too big and don't seem to care. There was 5 other professional companies that I made inquiries to and some didn't even respond and others took weeks even months to respond whereas when I made one simple email to URC, Within 24 hours I got a phone call from the closest rep to me.  Within a week we met face-to-face and started the process of having my company Out and certified by them. All these professional companies check to make sure you're a true legitimate company And don't let just anybody sell install their products, which is a good thing because if you're thinking about going to a pro system you would have to hire an electrical contractor or a low voltage company to do the install .  So you will know you are hiring a decent company if they've been certified by the home automation company they're selling
Back to URC:  With their mrx-10  or even Mrx-8 hub  I'm able to control all my AV and TV equipment, all my Z wave lighting and other Z wave products. I didn't even have to change out my Z wave switches I un included them from the old hub and reset them up URC.  Control my Ecobee 4 thermostat.   I used to have the nest learning thermostat but could not integrate with any other company anymore, once again thank you Google. Is that last weekend and I love the Ecobee,   I have the in wall touch screens and 2 different sizes that are gorgeous, even have a table top touchscreen Even hold in your hand and walk around the house.  They even have there own line of amps pre amps and music streamer. But you can also integrate with so many other companys too. They have the largest data base in the world for there integrating.  You can integrate sonos, heos, autonomic and so much more. You can find every tv, dvd, blu ray player, avr surround sound system and much more in there data base to intergrate with also.  I have made different routines, programs, macros to do all sorts of things in my house automatically or by the sound of my voice or even by my location. I won't go on and on but this was the professional system I landed on and the one that I sell to my customers. You can start off with a single Room application and grow from there over the years or just dive in and go big . They give you so many choices.   They have an add on hub where you can add your Z wave zig bee Bluetooth and WI fi devices. If my Internet goes down my smart home still works. They have a combination of cloud based and home base protocols. I can turn on and off anything if I am around the world or just in my living room.  They use the vera hub but just rebrand it (I'm ok with that because it's a good zwave/zigbee/bluetooth/wifi hub .

 I know that's a lot of information but hopefully a lot of people will get good you of this post. Good luck all your home automation project he their DIY or professional. If you do end up going professional do your research about the company or hiring and making sure that whatever system they are selling that they are up-to-date with their certifications with that home automation company I just buying the equipment off of ebay :-)

blacklight86,"Well, it's always the same problem when you build automation that is based on code or data that is located on someone else's computer (sorry, ""the cloud""). Especially when we're talking about automation of the own environment where you live in.

However I also think that it's extremely silly to conclude ""I don't trust tech in my house at all, let's ignore all the good things that can come out of it and show off instead how good I am in keeping my house a Paleolithic cave"". Home automation doesn't mean to have an Echo device in your bedroom or a Nest thermostat - that's automation for newbies. Automation means to have your own data pipeline, your own data stored in your home network, your own sensors, your own media center, your own automation routines that run on a Raspberry.

By gluing together pieces like OpenHab, Home Assistant, platypush, MQTT, PostgreSql and/or IFTTT one can easily build a home automation that will only run inside of the home network. Making your own temperature or humidity sensor nowadays it's just a matter of plugging an integrated circuit on top of a Raspberry or an Arduino, no soldering required. Lots of services put there provide APIs that you can glue together to access data from your own interface instead of some dummy app. There's no more excuse for being lazy if you're tech savvy, or worse coming out with nonsense bullshit like ""I don't trust home automation beucase it runs on someone else's computer"".",1570615366,f32kryr,t3_df7gec,t3_df7gec,/r/homeautomation/comments/df7gec/why_is_that_is_it_really_so_easy_to_hack_in_or/f32kryr/,1,homeautomation

Sometimes I can come over and walk it, sometimes it's his sister, sometimes it's another friend ect.   I have a key but nobody else does and if they need in I'm supposed to coordinate with them on the keys.  Like leave it under the mat or whatever and then get it back when they are done.  Sometimes somebody forgets to leave the key and I end up over there with no way in and have to go home and get my spare and drive all the way back.  It is a real pain in the ass.

I was trying to tell him to get a keypad garage door opener or a keypad lock and that way he could have multiple people with the ability to come in and out without the need for handling keys and if he didn't want somebody to have full time access he could set it up for 24 hours or whatever in the app.

He goes on this whole big thing about how they can be ""hacked"" and how unsafe that is

I'm like dude.... you are having me give keys to people you don't trust enough for them to have their own keys.  They could make copies any time they want until they give it back to me.  Then they leave it under the mat which is the first place somebody would look.  And this is safer to you than being ""hacked"" which cmon isn't gonna happen because you aren't some high level diplomat where China sends a crack team of hackers to get in your house.  No a burglar is gonna get in regardless in under 10 seconds anyways.

He's starts going on about how he's got a ""pick proof"" lock and it will be super hard to get in.  I then go to my car and get an old windshield wiper blade from the trunk and pull the wire out of it and bend it into a tension wrench, snap a 4 inch section off the other end and rub it against the concrete step a bit to create a makeshift rake and then pick his ""pick proof"" (kwikset lol) lock right in front of him in under 30 seconds.

Always_Has_A_Boner,"There's a few things you can do in this regard; I work in cybersec and run a fair few smart devices. First things first. If you're doing this on ISP owned equipment you're already wrong. So get yourself a quality modem and router. 

If your first priority is hiding your data from your ISP, you don't really have much in the way of consumer grade all-in-one solutions to cover your whole smart home. Probably the only ones worth going to the trouble for would be a home proxy server as well as running DNS internally too. I don't run a proxy, but I run Pi-Hole DNS ad blocker on my network, and it also acts as my DHCP server. A proxy server will make it appear as though all the traffic on your network is coming from the same machine; the DNS server is to wrest control of your DNS requests from the ISP to free and open ones run for the benefit of the internet. I suggest running DNSbench on your most high-end, wired machine to select a set of servers, but make sure to check which ones belong to your ISP. 

Aside from that, if you want to encrypt all your outbound traffic, you'd have to find a quality VPN service you trust and pipe all your traffic to them. Really, though, so long as you force secure versions of all major communications protocols, your ISP can't decrypt your traffic, and most likely wouldn't spend the time. The vast majority of us are fucking boring human beings not worth wasting valuable decryption resources on. Plus, if you're already doing some shady or illegal shit that necessitates a VPN, now you're giving all your secrets to some third party with unknown motivations or possibly even a desire to sell such secrets. Not a smart move in the long term IMO.

So in summary:

- own your own devices
- run internal DNS
- run a proxy server
- probably don't use a VPN",1569793052,f1x33hg,t3_dazius,t3_dazius,/r/smarthome/comments/dazius/help_for_security_for_my_smarthome/f1x33hg/,2,smarthome
fleetmack,"Do you have a hub already? I have 2 different types of smart dimmers in my house:

Lutron Caseta:  Requires a hub, dims perfectly, works perfectly, is aesthetically pleasing. You can buy a switch + a remote (pico) and mount the pico to the wall in place of the other switch. You just tie the line/hot/traveler wires together with a wire nut, and cap off the neutral behind the switch.

Homeseer: Requires a hub, z-wave (I trust this more than any other protocol). You'll need to buy a hs-wd100/200+ as well as a hs-wa100/200+.  These are not as pretty, do not dim as well with a low wattage load to the switch, but are cheaper than the caseta if you buy on ebay.

thehalfmetaljacket,"The broker is the MQTT messaging hub. It muxes/demuxs messages that it receives and keeps track of subscribers and publishers. All messages are sent from a publisher to the broker, and the broker is responsible for forwarding those messages to every subscriber of that particular topic.

Another key function of a broker is it is responsible for authentication of other nodes. Once a publisher sends a message to the broker, it cedes all control of who receives that message to the broker, so it is important that the broker be trusted to properly authenticate all subscribers to that topic. Similarly, when a client subscribes to a ""control"" topic, it must trust the broker that it will not allow a malicious client to publish malicious control messages to that topic.

The idea behind MQTT is that you can have arbitrary number of controller-type devices (e.g. smart home device that publishes to IoT device ""control"" topics) or an arbitrary number of data receivers that subscribe to ""data"" topics that e.g. sensors publish information to, or any other combination of endpoints. The point of the hub is keep track of all of the endpoints and the topics they sub/pub to/from so that each endpoint doesn't have to. If you're familiar with networking concepts, MQTT is analogous to multicast and a broker is the rendezvous point.

Hassio can be your mqtt broker or you can use a 3rd party broker like mosquitto and connect Hassio to that.

interrogumption,"I've reflashed all my tuya-based devices via wifi using tuya convert ([https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert)). Unfortunately this method is being closed off in new tuya firmware, so I don't know if you can do this or not. If it isn't possible the tuya convert process will simply fail to pick it up. But do check if someone else has successfully used the same switch so you know what settings to apply after flashing before you go that route. I DO NOT trust my network being potentially exposed leaving tuya devices with their standard firmware that DEPENDS on cloud control. Latency is pretty terrible when the commands all have to go to a server in china every time you want to switch something on or off.

Once reflashed, the new tasmota firmware works entirely via MQTT, entirely on your local network.

Overall, my experience of tuya based products (four smart plugs and three bulbs) has turned me off, even after reflashing with tasmota.

Gnant,"Well, what is so funny about yesterday I was going to tell you about how I used those controllers as Zigbee repeaters but didn't do so because it didn't seem relevant.  Little did I know.

There is one big advantage.  Alexa will not have to relay commands to another companies cloud to change colors etc...  They will be sent directly from your Echo Show.  Additionally, you will be strengthening your Zigbee mesh and ultimately you will be able to probably ditch both Sengled hubs.  

WiFi devices are notorious for dropping off networks and it is not a proximity issue.  I am not trying to say they are bad, but best left for thermostats, sprinkler systems, hot water heaters, things like that.  For sure not lighting.  That really needs to be locally controlled and not cloud dependent.

Plus you can get one of the RGBgenie [color remotes](https://rgbgenie.com/?product=rgbgenie-rgbw-remote-zigbee) to control everything since voice control during a movie is a pain, especially when the theater is on full display.  Pausing or muting a movie to dim or turn off lights sucks.  Trust me.  The neat thing about this remote is it will talk directly to the controllers.  In fact your Echo Show could be unplugged, the internet is down and your router offline, and the remote will still control everything.

As for strips, look at this [listing](https://www.amazon.com/BTF-LIGHTING-Whtie-16-4ft-60leds-Non-waterproof/dp/B01D1I4XBY).   The forth image down on the left is a good illustration of the difference.  These are only 12 volt, but you get the idea.  The 23 foot span would probably be just fine at 12 volts, but the bookshelves probably have more linear feet.  But if not then I am sure you would be fine with 12v.  And while if you put a volt meter to them it may show a drop,  visually it may be imperceptible.  It's when you start getting up into 10 meters that 24 volts becomes important.  But 7, your fine.

Additionally, get Meanwell outdoor rated power supplies.  They are more expensive but won't build up with dust, don't have a fan, and will be around 10 years from now.  They are rock solid.  

If you spend the extra on good power supplies like these and the controllers I mentioned, you won't have to touch anything for a long long time.  The strip above the TV you could probably get away with a 12v 5 amp power supply and those are cheap enough.

Vlad_the_Homeowner,"Oh, well if the lights are in yet then you have all kinds of options.  You could have him wire them all to a single socket (if feasible).  Then just put in a single smart switch, voila.

I say 'if feasible' because anything is possible, but it doesn't mean it'll be financially viable, nor does it mean it makes sense from an electrical or use point of view.  Do whatever you want in your own home, but you might want to give consideration to future owners.  Personally I'd think it weird to have all those places controlled through a single switch.  Doesn't mean I wouldn't want to be able to turn them all on at the same time, but there's going to be a time I just want the fireplace lights on and not the hall. 

Also, depending on your house layout and construction (access to crawl space or attic, open walls, etc)  getting all the wire runs back to one location could mean lots of fishing and holes. Hard to say without seeing it. I'd trust your electrician's opinion on this.

Your electrician might also want to convince you to install different circuits, as it's a little weird to have a light in the kitchen and over the fireplace linked to each other.  Again, hard to say without seeing the layout.  If he convinces you to have more than one circuit you could have him put them all in a single junction box.

YYCwhatyoudidthere,"Lots of good suggestions I would echo. A couple other ones to consider:

Ethernet to your garage (especially if it is detached.) Google Home/Alexa, WAP, smartTV, automated lighting, automated doors. It is surprising how much tech you can end up with in your garage.

Power outlets at the top of your windows. Smart shades can save you some money on heating and cooling, but are a PiTA to retrofit.

Even with a Ring Pro, I have power and Ethernet to my front door in anticipation of a better video intercom system. You may get tired of the monthly cloud fees.

You need more power in the utility room, or wherever you are centralizing your network gear. Trust me.

Speaking of the (newly named) network room: plan space for the patch panel and the network rack/cabinet that isn't sitting on the floor or directly under a water source. A cabinet takes up a surprising amount of space but is easy to accommodate among the furnaces and other gear if you plan ahead.

It is probably (certainly) overkill, but I have ended up running fibre from the network room to the media room my last two places. The media room ends up with a collection of gear (TVs, game consoles, media players, etc.) connected to a local switch which backhauls to the network room across fibre. The NAS sits in the rack in the network room, and I have no issues streaming anything to the media room and never a concern with latency or bandwidth.

I have Ubiquity APs on all three floors in the house. The neighbors probably hate it, but I have lots of bandwidth and a happy wife. The guest network is  isolated from everything else so visitors have easy access and my stuff is secure. So happy moving to ""enterprise"" equipment for this one.

You should also start thinking about your wired networking gear now too. You should run a lot of network cable, but it doesn't all need to be lit up on day one. Figure out the minimum number of ports, how many are PoE, choose appropriate switches and get them in the budget now.

jec6613,"Whatever you install needs to be bulletproof and pretty much maintenance free.  Ideally a Crestron or Elan system of course, but they're very expensive.  The DIY route for me:

Cisco small business router and WAPs, preferably with cellular backup plugged into it as well so the internet never goes down, and you can VPN into it.  Oh, and on a battery back-up.

Elk alarm system, tied into an ISY994iZW controller.  A real UL listed alarm system that feeds into a controller running an RTOS, not messing around with anything that could crash.  The Elk is a nice to have, something like the ISY is more of a need to have.

Z-Wave door locks, and the Aeotec USB powered leak sensors, or a bunch of the Insteon ones that seem to last forever on a single AA cell (I'm up to 4 years).  This will let you grant access to the home remotely, track access, and monitor the water situation.

A good programmable thermostat.  There are tons, but if you're going to be away for months you can set the heat to 55 and the AC to 90 to save a bunch of utilities, but you won't want it like that when you get home.

Unless you need the water on, just shut off the water when you leave.  You can get a fancy electronic valve that's easy to control with the system of your choice, but it's not necessary.  Shut the water off, drain the system from your lowest sink, and leave.

Lastly, and most importantly, friends or family who you trust.  I know that if one of my close friends got this sort of job, I'd happily come by once a week to mow the lawn and check in on the house for any signs of rodents, insects, or other nastiness, and then just take care of it for them.

No I didn’t forget that? How is tat relevant? I am not questioning your experience like you are mine? 


- Can you sincerely tell me how long you have been learning and informing yourself about HASS?-
I think I stumbled across HA maybe 2-3 months ago here on this sub when I kept seeing “HA is the best, if you have the time” and have since then I would say spent maybe 5hours a week on average looking into how this works and linking my z-wave controller and so on, I have had the raspberry pi for 4 days now and read into what I thought I needed for easily 4 hours a day since then trying to set it up properly first time.
I mis-understood and thought I needed to set up the Pi and then add the Hass image to the same card but that’s why I have had to reformat the card several times and I spent hours setting up remote access and network settings on the Pi on the Noob OS which was obviously the wrong thing for me to do.

I think you might be missing my point, I spent all my time learning the wrong things and that’s my fault but I thought an open community like this would be open to questions and help and that does not mean anyone owes that at all, trust me I don’t think that. But when I decided to try and go to HA I thought I would be able to some extent get some help from this subs past experience and posts but I actually felt anxious about asking anything expecting responses like your last one and even this one where you called me lazy but to me it’s just from looking at the wrong things and investing my time in essentially “stage 99” of home automation programming when I haven’t and don’t understand “stage 1” or it’s underlying fundamentals.",1561015220,ermcffs,t3_c2rt63,t1_ermb4iq,/r/homeautomation/comments/c2rt63/im_giving_up/ermcffs/,2,homeautomation

automate_the_things,"&gt; Firstly will my Vera continue to function by itself as it does now while I attempt to add everything to the Pi?

It should. You can connect it to the Pi as a Z-wave controller, too. There's upsides and downsides to using a stand-alone controller vs a Z-wave dongle directly on the Pi.

&gt;Secondly I have zero programming experience and a bit terrible with computers, there’s so many abbreviations that I have no idea about, I had to google for a bit just to figure out where to enter commands, is there any ELI5 install guides without abbreviations and huge assumptions on base knowledge?

kigmatzomat,"Vote for Homeseer. Aside from ""it works"" and ""it's reliable"" (which were the reasons I stopped using my vera plus);

Events/scenes are made using drop down menus. If (device A=x AND Device B=y OR time=...) then (set Device C=z AND...)
I built a couple dozen events in an afternoon. 

Logging - the logs are accessible from the main menu, are human readable and are easily searchable. (I can't say that's a plus over hubitat but it was over vera)

Mobile app is pretty good and available for android, iOS and Amazon fire (aka purveyor of very cheap tablets for wall-mounted UI). I think the hubitat mobile app just came out of beta in the past 2 weeks.

Timers and counters are easily made and leveraged in events.

Virtual devices are easy to set up.

Works with almost every zwave device. (There is a weird zwave IR relay that as far as I know isn't supported by any controller. Otherwise I think everything works with homeseer) zwave commands are easily added to events.

Device enrollment is fast. Most things enroll perfectly the first time. A few battery powered devices have been a pain but diferent batteries usually deals with that.

Expandable to security systems, home audio, pretty much anything.

Not likely to go out of business soon. Not saying hubitat is in trouble, just that Homeseer's 20th birthday is coming up while Hubitat is @2yro. 

Homeseer has an active base of users and developers. 

Homeseer docs are usually up to date (trust me, that makes a difference).

YYCwhatyoudidthere,"Have you identified who your target audience is? In my mind there are three broad categories of potential customer:

1) Consumers who want to show off their fancy house to their friends. Being able to turn lights on and off from their phone or through Alexa is ""automation"" in their minds and they can easily get that today. The thought of integrating email, scheduling, etc. is intimidating so your feature list probably scares them away. Or they trust the Philips and Amazon brands whereas you are an unknown.

2) Tech geeks (all of us here on Reddit.) We like the technical challenge and tying a bunch of stuff together. Most of us appreciate that automation is ""automatic'"" and recognize the benefit of your feature set -- but we already have a solution. I have been a Homeseer user for a long time, but I continue to download and play with competing products when they get enough buzz. But this only works in a try before you buy model. I am not going to spend any money to evaluate a new solution. There are some very credible, free competitors. Anyone starting out is likely going to try HA, or a trial of Homeseer before investing in your solution. 

3) System installers/integrators. They have businesses built around high cost installation and low cost support. Crestron, Control4, etc. have established vendor channels, support models and track record of reliability. There is a lot of perceived risk in moving to a new solution like yours.

If it was my play, I would focus on #2. If you have a feature that solves a frustration I have with my existing system I might give you a try -- but you are competing with my existing solution so you need to bring more to the table than just solving a single pain point. I would suggest you also need to provide some kind of free trial, and generate an active community of peers who can develop addons and help troubleshoot your product. Homeseer, Smartthings, HA all have very active communities. We aren't afraid of the complexity and difficulty of stitching everything together, so that isn't a big selling feature. Easier and faster is always nice, but it isn't a driving factor for anyone in this sub.

I appreciate that you are trying, and hope that you can bring something new and beneficial to the market. It is going to be a challenge though. No one NEEDS home automation.

You're a complete unknown, asking people to trust you with their home automation systems  
  
You're running a cloud-based service which are unreliable  
  
Your kickstarter doesn't do a good job of convincing anyone that the free alternatives aren't better, OR that they shouldn't just use a much better known proprietary system instead (Google, SmartThings, Apple, etc).

h11t0n,"Congratulations on purchasing your new home. First a few questions about your pad:

- What is the square footage/meterage of your new home?
- What material is it mostly made of? Concrete, dry wall, etc.
- How many floors is it?
- Do you have a lot of rebar in the structure? 
- Are you looking to place any big mirrors in the house? 
- Where do you want coverage? Living room? Office? Garden? Every freaking where. 
- Do you have existing CAT 6/CAT 5 cable in the walls with ethernet jacks? Where are they? 
- How many overlapping networks are there which will interfere with your devices? 

Remember the golden rule of smart homes 'network, network, network.'  If you want to make your home both smart and (the devices in it) STABLE start with the underlying network. Get the network right and you are laughing my friend. All your devices will 'magically' just work, never disappear from your network and work as the OEM intended. 

Trust me on this as your place is new if you have drywall put conduit in and run multiple CAT 6 cable links to as many rooms as makes sense. I.e. office, master bedroom, living room, etc. 

When it comes to connectivity:

Best: Wired. Anything that doesn't move that you can wire it. e.g. printers, speakers, cameras. 

Next choice: Wireless. The ideal situation here is a few wireless access points at key areas set to the lowest power possible and themselves wired to ethernet. Why low and not high? IoT devices have weedy radios verses access points. You want the smart home devices to be close enough that they can comfortably send as well as receive. Core access point placement should be where the highest concentration of smart devices is NOT randomly placed in the middle of the house to get the most 'coverage.' Locality is important. Get PoE powered access points then you only have to run ethernet cables. 

Last resort: Mesh. The red headed stepchild of connectivity. Unless you can't get round it avoid, avoid, avoid. If you have a better alternative wired or wireless use that every time. 

All of the above I learned painfully and from bitter experience. I live in a ~3,800 sq ft 4 storey place which is solid concrete and has 35 poorly configured overlapping networks. It's where WiFi goes to die.

IoT wise I have 50 plus devices which include:

- Sonos. 
- Philips Hue. 
- Sensibo. 
- Kasa. 
- Google. 
- Smartthings. 
- Custom raspberry PI based stuff. 
- Unifi cameras. 

Network wise I run Ubiquiti's Unifi system. 1 access point per floor powered by a PoE switch in the basement with a separate router. It runs flawlessly.

If your parents are technical, then no worries. Do whatever. 

The best way to think about it is to split it up into security, HA, and media and have each item trigger the right thing. 

For security, do they need monitored? Do they want wired or will they actually go around every 2-5 years replacing batteries? IP cameras (change switch to POE variant and put them on their own VLAN).  I wouldn't trust Google or Amazon with anything like entry so Doorbird is the better choice. If you get a traditional older alarm panel you can easily interface to a home automation platform. The new ones? Depends on the API... And whether the company gets bought out.

For home automation - wired or wireless? Hue is the best choice for wireless because it is the most used, but you could wire everything to not need wireless. I'd just use a HestiaPi or something open source. 

For video - I'd just run multiple cat 6A to locations.  You can always use it for HDMI, but realistically just put a Roku in each locations. It is a lot easier than switching HDMI and cat will give you more future proofing. Roku is just a lot easier to deal with from a daily living perspective. 

Audio - in walls? Sonos is better for distributed audio and software like Max2Play are a reasonable copy of it. Central with amplifiers? PC software or Heos/Bluesound are a bit better.

coogie,"FWIW, I hate everything about Adorne and wouldn't trust Legrand with being too loyal with their home automation stuff.  

First with Adorne, I think it tried so hard to look different and contemporary that already looks outdated and gaudy. 

I first saw it around 5 years ago and had a customer who was suckered by a kitchen remodeling company to add it to her kitchen and then one of the dimmers went bad and I had to go change it. It was a 3 gang box and the bad one was in the middle.  If it was a normal dimmer, I'd just pop it out, go back to the van and get a regular dimmer, change it, put it back in and be on my way.

With Adorne, everything is connected to a metal back plate (which has to be grounded or nothing will work by the way), so it meant I had to take the other 2 out also and they have these wimpy little connections in the back that had popped out so what would have taken me 5 minutes turned into a half hour just to troubleshoot the damn thing and then order one and come back the next week and then take everything out again and put it back in.  Complete waste of time.  I would stick with standard decora devices.

With Radiant, I've only seen it in the showroom of our supplier but Legrand has never been known for automation.  They bought a whole home automation company called Vantage a few years ago and got rid of a bunch of their older styles (many of which people still have), shook the sales teams around, got rid of loyal dealers (ahem) and it really doesn't seem like they know what they're doing IMO.

They make nice GFCI's, outlets, switches, plug molds, etc. but they are very new to home automation and came with this line to compete in the DIY market.  Will you find replacement parts in 5 years? Who knows?  Are these reliable? Who knows?  Do you want to be a beta tester for them? I'd stick with Lutron. They've done this longer than anybody else and are proven.

automate_the_things,"&gt;not put that much trust in Smartthings and Zwave

SmartThings and Z-wave are in no way related, and SmartThings being a flaming dumpster filled with dogshit has no bearing on Z-wave being good or not. I have all sorts of Z-wave devices and every single one has been 100% reliable for years.

WiFi is definitely not ""the future"" and in fact, given that there's an API change for Android that's going to require a small change within about the next year or so to every current app in the Play store to be made, otherwise Google will remove the app, there's about to be an apocalypse of shitty WiFi devices.  Unless they have a screen, then WiFi stuff universally requires an app to set up. You start the app on your phone, it looks for un-set-up devices, then creates and ad-hoc connection to them allowing you to send your SSID and password to them, at which point the device disconnects from your phone and attempts to connect to WiFi. Without this app you can't set up your device.

There's tons of posts on Reddit where people have WiFi crap where the random Chinese company that made it has removed the app from Play store (or Google did for one reason or another) and without that app, their device is a brick. With the upcoming API change to Android, it's exceedingly likely that TONS of these apps will not get updated at all and they'll be removed, since the company that makes this crap never updates anything after the sale. Sure, something like Lifx will update their app, but I'd bet the tons and tons of no-name crap on Amazon that's WiFi won't, unless it's a new product they're still selling.

Z-wave, by its very nature, is immune to this. There's no app needed to set each device up, you connect them via the hub, such as SmartThings (or, better, Home Assistant). So long as you have a functioning Z-wave dongle and Home Assistant set up, you can reconnect the devices anytime you need, regardless of whether the manufacturer is providing ongoing support.

And for battery powered devices, it's not even funny how much better Z-wave is than WiFi. Hundreds of times better power usage.",1557688763,en8sh5y,t3_bnhg10,t1_en6jti6,/r/homeautomation/comments/bnhg10/any_way_to_automate_this_timer/en8sh5y/,1,homeautomation

Dain42,"Yeah. Almost any scenario where an intruder works to compromise smart home equipment like people are talking about is *so much more wildly unlikely* than someone just kicking down the door or breaking a window and reaching in to unlock stuff manually. 

The idea that, without a smart lock, a burglar is going to pick your locks to get in…is kind of silly. It would just be so much more conspicuous to hang around with a lockpicking set or an armload of electronic equipment feverishly working to compromise your deadbolt.

People seem so much more likely to recognize this kind of highly improbable potential risk while ignoring all the likely benefits. With a smart lock, you can set it up to lock automatically when you leave the premises, in case you forget. You can schedule it to lock at night. You can check in on it remotely to make sure it's locked (and lock it if it's not). If you have a contractor of some kind coming in when you're not at home, you don't have to trust them with a key; you can just issue a passcode that expires.

Also, most electronic locks are deadbolts and locking a deadbolt is generally a better deterrent than other locks, if an intruder's intent was to break down a door. You're much more likely to hit a button to lock an electronic deadbolt than to fiddle with a key to lock a traditional one every time you leave.

All that stuff helps enhance the deterrent effect of your deadbolt, because it all makes it more likely that it's actually locked when it's should be, and it's all much more practical and probable than some kind of superhacker-*cum*-common burglar.",1557345060,emuxcya,t3_blubx0,t1_emttzr0,/r/homeautomation/comments/blubx0/psa_dont_put_your_google_homealexa_near_a_window/emuxcya/,3,homeautomation

Dain42,"/u/Shadowfalx is correct; your description isn't accurate, not least because ""listening"" isn't something that a machine can really do, and because it's got an over-broad meaning.

When these kinds of smart speakers are in their ""sleep/inactive"" state, they *are* ""listening"", in that the mics are turned on and the audio is being fed into some part of their local programming. But it's not voice to text that they're doing at that point. They don't have enough resources to do that reliably locally, as things stand. And uploading a constant stream of audio from every device to Google/Amazon would be *prohibitively* expensive. The only reason smart speakers/assistants like this are viable is because many, many people time-share the resources on a limited pool of machines (limited relative to the number of people who have these devices).

So they're not decoding language into symbols or words. They're doing something much more like what a dog seems to do when it recognizes its name or what birds do when they're listening for a call from another member of their species: they're listening for a specific sort of sonic pattern or vocalization. That's part of the reason why you have to train your assistant on the wake word before you can use the wake word. It needs to get to know your vocalization to know it's you. That's also why they'll occasionally activate at a similar phrase or at just the right combination of sounds or syllables from a show or from music.

So while it's ""listening"" by a very loose definition, it's not really something that a person would reasonably call ""listening"" in the common sense of the word: hearing someone else talk, processing their words, and understanding what they're saying.

Once it *does* recognize the wake-vocalization, only *then* does it start actually trying to recognize words and doing speech recognition on the audio. And that's the only time they transmit audio to the cloud or offsite. These devices are studied enough, and there are enough security professionals and white hat hackers out there, that we'd almost certainly know of any change in this model very quickly, even if it were attempted clandestinely.

But it's also unlikely to be attempted in secret — or at all, really — because it also runs counter to the aim of keeping you in the ecosystem and using these devices. If you lose trust in them, they've lost a customer.",1557336694,emujc7r,t3_blubx0,t1_emtxwyk,/r/homeautomation/comments/blubx0/psa_dont_put_your_google_homealexa_near_a_window/emujc7r/,2,homeautomation

It also isn't wiretapping. You install it, you know it's there, and the information it sends is known.

Sticking with Alexa is fine but that will necessitate cloud based devices, which in the long run you will find are reliant on too many variables out of your control.

Z-wave and Zigbee are good in that most smart home hubs control those devices locally.  You dont rely on other peoples computers and a connection to get to them, which is what the cloud essentially is.  So this would be my main recommendation, when it comes to devices, find out if you can control them locally or not.  And if not, pass.  

The other thing I would advise is don't be afraid of having more than on hub.  For some reason the stigma is that it is a big nuisance.  Trust me, it's not.

fat_shibe,"I'm quite sure most if not all sonoffs are outputting 3.3V so you should be safe there.

But...

The sensor connected via audio jack might be actually using the same GPIO14 as is the on the exposed PIN through-holes on the board (which you would solder a header onto and use for Nextion, right?). 
So you might not be able to use it exclusively for the Display.

Also... the display works best when running serial at 115200 bps, otherwise if you are updating a lot of things on the screen it might trigger the watchdog and reset your sonoff (if using espeasy and I presume other fw has something similar, without watchdog integration I wouldn't use it anyway).
It was happening to me and when I upped the speed it is rock solid.

Safety wise... I would still isolate the two completely.
Sonoff has live 220V(or 110V) and I wouldn't put it in combination with the display anywhere near water (safety is a bit of a paranoia for me:)... 
Why not coupling the Nextion with a nodemcu, powering the whole thing with safe 5V and leave TH10 separate. Both will work happily via wi-fi. The Nodemcu will drive any stuff you need reliably, you can update the display every 5 seconds (or probably less) reliably and even have another sensor (DHT22) connected to it and for few bucks extra measure air temp and humidity (just an example).

I am a big fan of Sonoff and Nextion, but can't really tell you if the 1MB flash size, in combination with the on board sensor + Nextion would be a stable and reliable combo. For literally 4 bucks you can give it it's own dedicated mcu and make the screen ""portable"" or at least have much more freedom when it comes to mounting it. I would not trust longer serial lines as well...

Just thinking out loud here...don't take it the wrong way...of course I don't know anything about your particular setup... just from my experience I like the fact that my Sonoff relay unit is safely tucked out of sight and I have a screen on the wall...meters away, powered with 5V and under the display enclosure sits a DHT22 measuring air temp and humidity..

mrimperfect,"All of those ""invincible"" names you mentioned were acquired by extant companies that still use their foundational tech. They didn't simply ""go away"". 

The nature of bleeding-edge tech is that there will be consolidation at some point. 

Also, there is no such thing as the cloud, it's just someone else's computer. Do you trust that other entity's machine more than yours? Is it more performant? Is it more secure? If you write Python, do you trust Conda to manage your libraries and dependencies, or do you manually load them and revert back to the days of dependency hell? We are now at a place where most major enterprises trust Azure or AWS to manage all of their applications. We do that because MS and Amazon have proven time and again that their solutions are better than running things on-prem.

Now, let us take a look at home automation, and specifically cloud-based solutions. Iris, Wink, and Stringify were always niche solutions (I am not familiar with ARTIK so I cannot comment). All of them are proprietary in nature, and do not have a peer-reviewed support community. Why would anyone trust those solutions when there are hubs like Smartthings, and integrators like Home Assistant, that have the backing of Samsung, as well as webCoRe functionality (groovy and yaml are proven languages)? 

Ask yourself if a smart home tech has an active open-source community (Home Assistant). If it does not, ask yourself if it is backed by a major player that has skin in the game (Lutron has been a leader in home lighting for decades). If the answer is not ""yes"" to one or both, then you are walking down the path of planned obsolescence.",1554873987,ekj1edu,t3_baxosv,t3_baxosv,/r/homeautomation/comments/baxosv/iris_closes_shop_wink_is_on_the_edge_artik/ekj1edu/,2,homeautomation
Djaesthetic,"You’re not wrong on a lot of points, but you’re missing a broader point regarding why “cloud” exists to begin with.

I.T. has always been about trying to find that balance between TCO, sustainability, manageability, and growth. “The Cloud” doesn’t exist because enterprise wants your data (*though that did inevitably turn in to a huge monetized advantage on their part*). It exists because companies with limited manpower wanted a way to have access to technology and pay for it as a service without the cost of hosting the infrastructure, the know-how to self-manage, maintain, upgrade, etc. They want new features as they’re introduced and not once every 2 years when accounting green lights additional funding in the budgets. Businesses also wanted a better way to track opex expenditure without having to worry about large capitalized expenses every few years.

...that’s why “*the cloud*” exists to begin with.

Unfortunately, as you know, it also introduced a bunch of additional security gotchas (MAYBE). I say maybe because can you guarantee me your on-premise system, being secured and maintained by someone whose job it is to manage your product 5% of their time, is more secure than the cloud platform managed by people who do it 100% of their day? No. You reasonably can’t.

At the end of the day all of this is one great big balancing act. It always has been. It always will be. You take a very hardline and idealistic stance on it all now, and trust me when I say “I get it,” but real-world is going to require you a lot more flexibility to ever successfully go to market the way the market will want you to. What are you going to say when you design an AMAZING platform and some billion dollar company ends up loving the sales pitch, but they dictate they don’t want to host the infrastructure for it? After all, everyone else is selling software as a service — why aren’t you? It makes you look like you lack agility and are stuck in the past. Realistically that might not be the truth, but it’s not going to matter.

coogie,"I just saw this so it's probably late but perhaps someone will google this later.   I'm certified in both Vantage Infusion and Lutron and have known some Crestron people so perhaps I can share some feelings and experience.  First some background on each company:

* Lutron is the undisputed king of lighting. They pretty much only do lighting (shades and some other things too but lighting is their focus) They invented the solid state dimmer, they have the best RF controlled dimmers, they have the best styles, and the best LED dimming IMO.  You'll find a lot more dealers from them because they cater to both AV companies and electrical contractors. 
* Vantage was a much smaller company based in Utah that just did centralized lighting systems and moved on to more sophisticated things like touch screens, and integration.  With Infusion, they've moved more and more into total home automation though not as good as Crestron and were bought by Legrand. More on that last part in a bit.  Their dealers USED to be electrical contractors and AV dealers but with the push towards whole home automation, they have got rid of electricians in favor of AV companies. I don't trust the way the company operates now.
* Crestron is kind of the opposite of Vantage where they started in whole home automation and used to link to Vantage and Lutron systems but later did their own lighting but nothing that impressive (again my opinion).  Their dealers are mostly AV companies.

No matter which system you go with, they're all going to be great for the first 3-5 years.  The only difference is just their styles and which dealer you have available in your area.  Keep in mind that you can't do anything without a dealer. They have access to the factory for warranty, software updates, replacements, even engraving a button.  

The problem is that neither of these companies is too fond of having their dealers sell the other person's product so it's very cut throat and now with DIY offerings that are getting better and better, they really want to know that their dealers are serious and drop dealers.   This is a problem for you.

In my experience, Lutron has the most programmers and the company is on solid financial grounds and will not be bought by other companies.  I would go with them if it were me, at least for the lighting. I would keep lighting on its own thing because lighting HAS to work.  Once Vantage was bought by Legrand, they brought in a new sales team and they got rid of a lot of dealers that were not selling enough according to them, even if they did a lot of service work. As such, we no longer work on Vantage. It's a shame because there are many older systems that now need service but the focus is on new sales. I can't in good conscious recommend them. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Vantage's systems. Their panels are elegant and the tech is solid. I would not worry about the 2 wire bus...it's actually much easier to work with.  The problem is that the power supply, the weakest point in the system is built into their controllers and after 5-10 years, will need replacements and the factory is the only place that can fix it. For that, you need a dealer and if you do a search in your zip code, you'll see that they're not in abundance.   

Crestron will likely be around for a while. But they are a premium. Their dealers act like they're scientists or something and often quite arrogant. I've never understood that but they do have nice products if you have the money. 

Last, even though I've installed or serviced dozens of panel based systems, I feel that in retrospect, they might not be the best solution because they are the hardest to undo later if any of these companies go out of business. LiteTouch was put out to pasture when Savant bought them. Those homeowners are now SOL and will have to spend many thousands of dollars to replace their entire system to Lutron or Vantage.   I think it's better to just have a more hybrid system where you have a keypad at the entrances of rooms, hallaways, etc. but use wall mount modules nearby in standard boxes so after 10 years you can easily move to another system.  There are far more systems that work that way rather than there are  panel based systems.",1554770589,ekfnuhm,t3_abgr2f,t3_abgr2f,/r/homeautomation/comments/abgr2f/lighting_control_vantage_vs_crestron/ekfnuhm/,1,homeautomation

True, listings aren't what they used to be. They're way more stringent. UL fucking loves money, and they don't make money by handing out a label to whomever asks. No, they make their standards more difficult to meet and their test criteria more involved and expensive. Manufacturing defects are always a possibility, but I trust that the design of any product with a UL label is safe when used for it's intended purpose and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

Intertek (the owner of the ETL label) usually tests to published UL standards, but they're not as well trusted in the industry.

Gnant,"Go with the Hue.  For a few reasons....

1) **Greater range.**  WiFi bulbs only go as far as your signal, a ZigBee mesh network can be extended far beyond your routers range.  So connecting with that shed out back won't be an issue.

2) **Not cloud dependent.**  This should be number one on the list.  And while it may not seem like a big deal, it becomes one when you can't use your lights.  With Hue, all my remotes and touch panels can still control the bulbs even if my Hue Bridge and Router both take a dump, regardless if I even have internet.

3) **Having a the bridge is no bid deal.**  People make a lot of noise of how another hub/bridge is a nuisance.  Trust me when I say I plugged in my bridge when I first got it and haven't touched it since.  There is zero maintenance.  Just tuck it away and never look at it again.  No big deal.  I am sure you have a ton of things you have plugged in and haven't touched in years.  This is no different.

4) **Third Party products.**  In addition to Philips products, other brands play nice with the hue bridge as well.  So ultimately you will have a greater selection.

5) **Integration:**  Hue integrates with everything, I mean everything.  I am sure Lifx has great compatibility as well, but someday you will expand your system to beyond just lighting and need a smart home controller of some type.  You will want motion sensors or the like and if you wanted them to control your lights, well... see number 6.

6) **Response Time:**  This relates to number 1 as well, but having to ping a request through the cloud every time does add to the devices delay.  So if you want that motion sensor to trip a light, every request will be cloud dependent with Lifx.

7) **Networked devices:**    While not a big deal if you have a few WiFi smart devices, when you start getting up there in count your other devices will suffer.  There are may who have several Hue Bridges because they reached the 50/60 device limit.  I would hate to see what 100+ WiFi devices would do to my Netflix.  I can guarantee I would wish I hadn't started down the WiFi path.  

&amp;#x200B;

The argument for Lifx:  **Cost and some models are brighter.**   But that just isn't enough to sway me for the reasons mentioned above.

* The real money is in working with homebuilders with dealer based systems, but they already have their own electrician, plumber, AV guy, security guy, etc. so you better have a lot of experience if you want to get in that world and know lots of people.
* Being certified with a dealer system is enough to work for someone else, but these companies don't usually make anybody a dealer unless you have very high volumes.  I've worked with Lutron for 15 years now and we've bought hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of products from them by now but we still are just a blip to them and have to make our purchases through our supplier.  Vantage just dropped us for not selling enough.  I'd imagine Crestron is the same.  Right now with all the DIY systems, those companies are circling the wagons and getting rid of dealers who don't sell.   I hope you dad knows what's expected of him sales-wise. 
* Finding customers out of the blue is hard.

If you really wasn't to know that your stove is on or what temperate your fridge is, use a power-sensing appliance plug or wireless thermometers.

I would avoid Wi-Fi, too; a few devices won't be bad, especially if they are all one brand, but they quickly get difficult to handle. Avoid the cheap Chinese ones in particular; a few have been in the news recently with security problems. Zigbee or Z-Wave is a lot more secure. Plus, they also use their own mesh network, so you don't have to worry about flaky Wi-Fi affecting devices. You do need a hub, but that hub is a single point of entry, instead of a bunch of bulbs and things all connecting to various servers all the time, there's one hub connecting to one server, which limits security holes.

I prefer smart switches over smart bulbs; you can put bulbs in lamps, but a switch works even if the network is down. It's also familiar, so guests aren't left in the dark.

Look at door and window sensors; you can set up a routine to turn on a light when you open the front door, then turn it off again 10 minutes later, so you don't have to fumble for lights with your arms full of groceries! Motion sensors, too.

Smart thermostats are fairly inexpensive, especially if you get a Z-Wave one and use a hub to add scheduling, rather than something like a Nest.

MdotR,"I love how thorough this is, and informative as well. I am shocked that such a decent size company is allowing such a novice company to be in charge of something so important. As someone who works in property management for a relatively small company (only 70ish buildings in the tri-state area,) our upper management turned down having a novice laundry cleaning company for one of our luxury communities... I am also shocked with the little notice they provided for such a important thing. While we are only obligated to give 48 hour notice, I usually give a week or two. Even to change the air filters!

I would highly suggest sharing this with a lawyer. I certainly think this could be an issue worth legal council. I only work for a property management company, and I am not a lawyer, but it certainly this is something that would be in conflict with our leases.

If you do end up sending it on your own, I do want to suggest removing this paragraph:

&gt;Necessarily, these hubs must have a master keycode (to be used to “re-key” the locks when a tenant moves out, or let maintenance/emergency personnel in) which is stored by the property management company and SmartRent likely somewhere on company servers. As users, we have no control over this, no idea who will and won’t have access to the key and, to this point, no trust that it will be safe. Having this key stored in a networked location accessible by unknown numbers of people is like having a picture of the grooves of a physical master key on company servers.

I feel like this may not be relevant. Typically, regardless of your entry system, from a physical key, to a fob, to mobile entry, management is legally granted access to apartment homes. You, as a resident, will never have control over who in management will have access to those keys. Management companies usually only want 1-2 people to have access in order to mitigate misuse, but I have seen that not be the case many times in the past. Keys or master fobs get passed around. Super may go on vacation and you have a stranger you never met covering the community. New leasing staff. Etc.

Most leases outline that they are legally allowed access into the apartment. Some even state that if you re-key the door, you must provide a copy to the landlord. This is for obvious reasons like emergencies, such as smoke/fire, carbon monoxide, plumbing and water heater issues, etc. For non-emergencies, as you mentioned, they have to provide some notice.

safe_for_vork,"This is probably one of the most sought-after automation ideas for most folks, but it's not an easy target to execute well.

First, I strongly suggest starting with public spaces and restrooms instead of a bedroom, since bedrooms are one of the hardest to automate well (the occasional misfires in the middle of the night will make you give it up, trust me).

Some approaches and tricks that might be helpful:

* Xandem ([xandem.com](https://xandem.com)) is one of the only solutions I know of that seem like they might actually be able to do direct presence detection. Having said that, in my mind they're quite pricey and still a beta product. I would wait a few years or build your own unless you don't mind the cost.
* Install many more PIR sensors than you think you need, so you capture any movement in the room, and set a long timeout so lights never shut off prematurely (e.g.: \~15 mins for restrooms, 1-2 hours for your living room, etc.)
* DIY: Add sensors that don't require LoS (line of sight) to the detector, like the cheap radar sensors you can buy today (e.g.: RCWL-0516 which is $0.5). These have some issues with false-positives and are totally DIY, but they have great potential when used with classic PIR sensors to keep the lights on (they react to very small movements like magic, but require more power than PIRs so can't be battery powered).
* DIY: Count people entering and leaving using 2 PIR in a quadrature layout (arguably one of the very best solutions to presence, but I'm not aware of any commercial solution on the market).
* DIY: BLE presence detection via tracking phones or BLE tags - seems really cool, but I think it's not reliable enough to be used for real-time detection.
* Explicit detection hacks:
   * In a restroom: attach a simple door sensor to the lid of your toilet, so your automation can tell when the seat is up and keep the lights on.
   * In a bedroom: add strain guages (weight sensors) to the foot of your bed, so you can tell if there's no-one / a pet / a person / multiple people on the bed (possibly even say who is there if your weights differ enough)

pseudocultist,"Couple of thoughts.  First, your ethernet runs are probably the #1 thing to worry about right now.  Also wiring for smart blinds if you may want them eventually - cheaper to do it at studs than at completion.  Most of the other smart products are really designed to go in existing houses - smart switches and outlets wire up the same as their modern dumb counterparts, doorbell camera will use a standard 12v doorbell transformer, etc.  Unfortunately a lot of consumer-level surveillance products are wifi only, so there's no way to hardwire - although some people still do use PoE to power them.  But if you go with something a bit more prosumer (like Ubiquiti's solutions), you'll find full ethernet options (trust me, sharing your wifi bandwidth with a bunch of always-streaming cameras sucks.)

My house was rewired 20 years ago with double runs of cat 5e, forward thinking, but I'm already thinking about what it will take to rewire it again eventually  The second run was just for telephony, but thank god it's there - I'm in the process of converting them to Ethernet terminations, for a Ubiquiti wifi network.

So, I would look at doing double runs of Cat 6 to not only each room, but also a ceiling box for wifi APs in whatever rooms you'll want them.  Ceiling wifi has less chance of being obstructed by furniture.

Smart outlets are pricey as hell, if you're doing a whole home.  My house has like 70 duplex outlets.  We use a combination of smart bulbs and switches, and wemo wallwarts for devices we want to control, and it does the same thing much cheaper.

Power consumption monitoring - something everyone's looking at these days.  I'd look at a smart circuit breaker like Leviton just announced, or something like Sense in the breaker. 

Have you considered battery backups, if you will need them?  PoE is a great way to get everything on one backup battery/generator, your APs, cameras, and other devices will draw from the powered switch.  But our power was out for an hour today - we discovered the new tankless gas water heater doesn't work without it.

According to Sengled customer service, that power outage, (we have 20+ ea. winter) happened in the two hr. period that an update was unknowingly being performed. I'm not sure I believe that. If true, why didn't they consider a power outage rendering their product inoperable &amp; useless. Because of an update? No. Obviously, this is not a well-thought out product.

kperkins1982,"They work with the heating/cooling/ventilation systems as a whole

One part of which is the stat that tells these systems what to do

They tend to not like them for several reasons

1. Instead of being powered by a common wire they are ""power stealing"" devices and this can cause trouble in various ways.

1. Often a stat will have to be wired up multiple times before it works

1. If they do have problems installing it they prefer to just pop on a meter and troubleshoot what is wrong.  Not with the nest though, you've gotta get on hold with their tech support who know way less than the hvac techs but are required to help fix the problem

1. The marketing sorta lies.  It says it works with every system, but there are types of systems that it really has problems with and if there is a problem the customer assumes the tech is the reason as they've become enamored with the shiny nest and believe it can do no wrong.

1. A tech would prefer to install a stat that they like, that they know works reliably with certain equipment and they won't get callbacks on.  However if somebody wants a nest and there are ever any problems down the road the customer gets pissed and calls back the tech.  So instead of working on mechanical systems they have to troubleshoot finicky stats that have problems (bad relays is a common problem for example) but also the customers knowledge of how the thing works.  Say like if the temp drops dramatically but the nest thinks based off of paterns it doesn't need to provide heat at that time of the day the customer becomes upset when they wake up to a freezing house and think something is wrong with the heat pump and frantically call for help.  The tech drives over assuming something is wrong mechanically with the system only to find the programming caused the unit not to turn on.

At the end of the day though the real reason they don't like them is a good tech will stand behind anything they work on in your home.  If they only install equipment they trust they know their good name won't suffer.  However if they install things at the request of the customer they have to keep coming back to fix things out of their control or suffer a hit to their reputation.

lastingd,"This can be done with an energy monitoring smart plug. The $20 IS what people will pay for it. It's not worth making a niche device like this for $20 retail price (+ Tax, Shipping, Amazon's Cut). The consumer market can achieve this easily with a smart plug. 

Look for other applications, perhaps commercial, where a device like this makes sense to resell for $500 from which you will be able to build a business.

A $20 resell price isn't worth getting out of bed for unless you are going to a significant number (10K + month) and trust me, you won't sell enough to make it worthwhile. Plus the high price charged by current mfrs for putting IOT in an appliance will flip soon and device statuses will be easily accessible at a normal price, i.e. it will become standard, so the market is small and getting smaller. 

Great idea though and I'd advise looking at other applications. 

Here's a couple of ideas off the top of my head : 
Generators, small planes, stuff that shakes about, in a market that has customers with $$ to spend (sorry subs but we're all cheap), where monitoring and logging something would be cool AND helpful. Where third party integrations bring added value and revenue opportunities.   

Engines need their run times logged and monitored. They all have devices for this, but these are not ""connected"" your device could connect the runtime data via BT.

Third party services :
Integrate with plane app software, all pilots use Ipads, find out what they use, are they interested in a device that does the above?

Generators etc, the market for these is huge. Lorawan (long range), 5G, 4G all offer ways of monitoring devices on work sites.

Be sure to review all competitive offerings (I clearly haven't). Can you make it cheaper / better ? If not look for another gap.

1. I wanted to segregate home automation traffic to a different wireless frequency.

redroguetech,"&gt;Just read through your getting started guide and it seems this place is for a very advanced and busy users.

I would rewrite the guide to be even more user-friendly, but I'm actually involved in writing an e-book for beginners. When I have completed that project, I will revisit the post, though that will probably be too late for your needs ;-)

&gt;Once this is setup, I can start on raspberry pi and these advanced automation controllers.


To be honest, I'm not real familiar with Pi setups. I have an RPi, but only to add features to my Hubitat ""hub"". Compared to Hubitat or Wink, a RPi running Home Assistant isn't actually a cheap solution. My setup, with a case and heatsink-fan, was more expensive than my Hubitat (and my SmartThings). However, that's also not including a Zigbee and/or Z-Wave radio. All combined, an RPi setup will probably be $150 to $200. It also took several hours to get it up and running, though I was not installing automation software. If you have Linux experience, it would presumably be a lot smoother.

&gt;I really want someone to tell me pros and cons of this new aqara gateway used in the UK.

I trust you saw my ""mega review"" concerning Hubitat, and presume you've decided against it. If not... In short, the only major issue with it is that there's no app for remote access (it's supposed to be released in April, but will probably be rudimentary, but no feature set has been published). If that's not an issue, I have no reservations in recommending it as a cheaper alternative to an RPi (though more expensive than SmartThings; see below). Nonetheless, with that presumption in mind....

I've never used the Aqara hub or read up on it. I doubt it's a serious contender, but I would bet that the software side of it slapped together garbage. If you are short on money to be able to get both an RPi and devices to actually automate (and not interested in or can afford the Hubitat), then I'd recommend a SmartThings as a good place to learn, with some caveats. First, I'd suggest planning on transitioning to something else. Aside from being cloud-based, it's a capable device, but I just do not trust Samsung's leadership to not screw it up (more than they already have). Second, don't even bother with the built-in automation methods (such as the Smart Light App, or ""routines""). Start with using WebCoRe. It will probably be more than enough to handle anything you might want to do, but if not, then learn how to write your own apps.

&gt;I am also trying to understand why these gateways require their server set to China and not any other region.

Short answer is that Xiaomi isn't concentrating on the European and American markets. Although they do have US and European plug options for appliances, even their cellphones lack the US frequencies. That would by another concern with the Aqara. I know it does not support Z-Wave, which does have a different frequency in Europe, but not sure on Zigbee. I presume not, or else their sensors wouldn't work at all outside China.

My biggest concern for you would be starting out learning a system that simply won't apply. At least get as close to your ideal setup at the beginning as you can afford. Again, I don't know for sure, but getting the Aqara might end up being  like buying a bicycle to learn how to drive a stick-shift.

My suggestion remains the same as Yale or Schlage. However, I'm not familiar with any non-smart smart locks, except Samsung's. It has impressive features, but I just wouldn't trust Samsung to secure my home.

A ""hub"" would only become needed if you want remote management, or more automation than just auto-locking (such as scheduled locking). If you don't want any other automated devices, then SmartThings would be a good choice.

&gt;I would have liked a keyless door, but my new door is coming pre-bored from the factory for 2 holes, so I need a lock that is designed for that.

Not sure why the sound is so important to you, but I have a Yale, and it's pretty loud. However, it's not that bad when the batteries are full, and if the bolt has a smooth slide into the hole.

Used to have the Z-Wave devices on Surety (alarm.com), but found the automation of Smartthings was much better (do not let the shade close if the window of open, etc).

I plan to keep Surety because it is rock solid for alarm monitoring.  I do not trust Smartthings with the important things like fire and my family safety.

Initially I moved all of my Z-Wave to Smartthings, then made the 2Gig a secondary controller and learned in under Smartthings.  Works, but my locks could no longer be controlled by 2Gig.  Since all my automation routines we on Smartthings at that point, I eventually removed the 2Gig from Smartthings.  Now 2Gig is only security, and Smartthings is only automation.

I had to double up on some door and window sensors, but with your wired take over module, you can easily wire a Smartthings website in parallel, if needed.

It is possible for Smartthings to know the Arm/Disarm state of the 2Gig.  I wired a Smartthings sensor to the open collector output of the 2Gig panel.  This way when I arm 2Gig, Smartthings smart lighting rule turns off the lights, lowers the blinds, locks the doors, etc.

I even told them I'm willing to pay the $15 a month more just for them to turn on the Z-Wave capability and they would not do it making some excuse that my contract does not allow it. Plus it's a three-year contract which will finally be over in one more month. 
Now that all of that information is out of the way I investigated and did my research and found that nest has one of the best security systems out there. I am an electrical contractor and a nest Pro installer but only became a pro install or after I installed my own nest security system in my own home. I don't have them monitoring it yet because I'm still under contract but it works wonderfully even without paying a monitoring fee. Yes it only works off your internet until you pay the monitoring fee and then you get the cellular service. I like how I can either pay month to month which is around $23 and it goes through Brinks which is a name we all can trust and Nationwide, or I can sign a three-year contract and pay $19 a month.
In my humble opinion I would really look into the nest security system. You're paying a little more upfront and buying the equipment, but it's worth every penny. When you start adding in the door lock the smoke detectors the motion sensors and the alarm system, then adding some cameras the system is almost unbeatable. I love how if an alarm is triggered it comes right up on my phone and goes to the closest camera so I can see exactly what's going on.

jrob801,"Here's what you need to complete your install:   


A cabinet to terminate all of your networking cables. I'd recommend AT LEAST a 24U sized cabinet for your purposes. Make sure the cabinet you choose has enough depth for the equipment you choose for it. I'd recommend getting one that has at least a 17"" mounting depth.  If you plan to put a rack mounted server in it for a significant media (or other purpose) server, you will likely want a deeper AND larger (32u, 38U or 42U) cabinet. 

A Coax patch panel large enough to account for all of your runs (mount this at the bottom of your rack, because when you hook up TV service with amplifiers, etc, you're going to have a fair amount of wiring to deal with and it'll be harder to keep organized up high in the box).

A 24 port and a 12 port patch panel for your cat6 cables. You can do this with a single 48 port patch panel, but that's pretty tight quarters to work in, especially if you're not used to working with these connections. 

A network switch: There are a few ways to accomplish this, depending on your needs. 

* You can buy a single switch with enough ports to cover all of your needs if you just want networking everywhere. If you ran extra cable runs for flexibility, it's likely that a 24 port switch will be sufficient. 
* If some ofthese runs are destined for security cameras, you'll want Power over Ethernet. If that's the case, it's probably going to be significantly cheaper to buy two switches to handle your load. I have a 24 port gigabit switch for my networking needs and an older HP 24 port POE switch that is 100 mbps (plenty of speed for security cameras)

A couple of shelves for other devices you want to keep inside your cabinet. I have a couple raspberry pi's, my cable modem (router is outside of the cabinet so wifi isn't blocked by the cage), and a small server for my home media center and my blue iris server for security cameras, a couple external HD's, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trust me, you want to set your closet up this way, rather than just terminating everything with ends and dealing with 40+ loose wires anytime you need to change something around. I' dealt with the loose wires in my old house for 15 years, and it's a royal pain. In my new house, I've done the networking cabinet and everything is so much easier to deal with. It's well worth the minimal cost for a cabinet and patch panels to avoid wrestling wires on a semi-frequent basis.

firestorm_v1,"First thing's first.  Let's talk about your connectivity.  You have FIOS which is fiber to the house (FTTH).  There's probably a sizeable box on the side of your house where the fiber comes in.  That box is called a NID (Network Interface Device) and is Verizon's edge of their network.  Inside that NID, you have an Ethernet port that is where you add your router (via a long cable).  Think of NID as the fiber version of the ""modem"" like you'd see with DSL and Cable lines, or as the CPE device for a fixed-point wireless (rural wifi).

The router they provided you is more than likely an All-in-One unit.  Ethernet (from the NID) goes in, and you have wireless and a few wired ports to connect to for Internet connectivity.  Inside that device, there are three major components that make up the all-in-one router:

1: The actual router.  Think of this as a module that has two interfaces.  A ""WAN"" interface that is public facing and has firewall rules that block inbound access (baddies can't get in).  A ""LAN"" interface that is pointed internally and has the admin page for your router and a few other services (DHCP for handing out IP addresses, maybe a DNS relay).  The LAN interface has firewall rules that allow devices on the LAN to get outside to the public Internet.

2: A switch.  This switch has one or two more ports than the physical interfaces on the back of your router.  As an example, if you have four ports on the back, you may actually have a six port switch.  These two ""hidden"" ports aren't connected to a usable interface, but are wired to components on the router's circuit board.  One port is hardwired to the LAN side of the router (solder traces), and the other port is connected to the Wireless AP.  The switch is responsible for handling communication between wired devices and the router or between wired devices and other wired devices.

3: The Wireless AP (WAP, AP, whatever.. the ""rabbit ears"") - This is the device that bridges your wired connection (remember the second ""hidden"" port on the switch?) to your wireless network.  Wireless devices that are authorized to be on your wireless network (associated) can communicate with other wireless clients and with wired clients seamlessly.  You don't have to know that a client is wired or wireless in order to communicate, you just have to know the IP address (or the DNS hostname) of that device.

These all-in-one units are convenient however in that convenience, you also give up a great deal of flexibility.  Things like you can admin both your AP and your router from the same interface (referred to as ""single pane of glass"") are benefits to using an all-in-one unit however the costs are that you're stuck to a single fixed configuration.  All in one router manufacturers are just now getting around to implementing things like Guest Networks, and VLAN support, and even then, their versions of common features leaves a lot to be desired.

Consumer all-in-one routers are notorious for failure, or lackluster features and for the more experienced are usually used only as a last-ditch-effort.  As networking technology changes and faster speeds become more affordable, the appeal of a consumer all-in-one diminishes rapidly.  

Here's a shot from the hip list of pros and cons for an all-in-one versus dedicated components:

Pros (for all-in-one):

1: Easy to install - Plug in the WAN, plug in power, plug in the computer and go.  
2: Easy to configure - One admin username and password to remember and single pane of glass configuration means you can configure your router and wifi from one session instead of logging into both devices.  
3: Integrated components mean less mess - Only one device to hassle with.  
4: Devices are usually small and can be hidden easily. - Out of sight out of mind until you have to reboot it...

Cons (for all-in-one):

1: Limited configuration options - Can't do VLAN support on most aio's, nor can you do VPN on them either.  Can't write complex firewall rules, and up until recently, most couldn't do guest SSIDs for wifi.  
2: Firmware support dries up - As the manufacturer moves on to the new hotness, the older devices get left in the dust. No firmware updates mean that new vulnerabilities go unpatched until the device becomes too insecure to trust.  
3: Single point of failure:  Let's say your cat chews up the power supply cable for your all in one.  You're offline until you can get a new one.    
4: Uptime and longevity is very poor - Why do you think most tech support starts off with  ""Well did you powercycle your router?""

Pros (for dedicated devices):

1: Vendor agnostic devices - You can have a pfSense firewall, UniFi APs, Cisco switches, and AXIS IP Cameras all on the same network.  As long as it speaks Ethernet or Wifi, it'll work.  You aren't locked into any specific vendor although some vendors have devices that interoperate with each other (Unifi is a really good example of this).  
2: Your configuration options are wide open and only restricted by the hardware's capability rather than weak software restrictions either via out of the box configuations or via added on modules.  
3: Your network evolves as tech becomes affordable - Instead of replacing your router every few years, you can replace individual components one at a time as is feasible.  As new tech comes out (maybe you decide you need a 10GbE NAS?) you can upgrade or add components as needed.  
4: Professional and Enterprise gear are better supported - Pro and Enterprise gear is very well documented and supported with firmware updates longer than consumer versions.  Some even offer on-site support or 24x7 phone support depending on vendors.

Cons (for dedicated devices):

1: Bulky - Pro and Enterprise devices usually come in 19inch widths and quarter or half-depth sizes.  You may want to get a rack to put them in (take a look at Ikea's [Lack Rack](https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/LackRack) for creative ideas on how to keep them organized or maybe consider a vertical wall mount to keep them out of the way.  
2: Loud - Depending on the manufacturer, rack mount gear can be loud.  Consider mounting the gear in a closet but watch those temps!  
3: Steep learning curve - Pro and Enterprise devices have a lot of features and offer a lot of options, however this comes with the cost of time learning them.  Fortunately, there's lots of resources online to find out answers.  
4: Expensive - Dedicated devices are usually more expensive than their all in one counterparts, however considering that you're buying a purpose built device, it's generally worth it.

I understand my phone is uploading data to advertisers and app creators.

coogie,"You found him! Seriously though,much like with everything else, electricians specialize in different things. Lighting controls is  just not something they learn unless they worked for a company that specializes in them.  I was hired to do the lighting automation on a commercial/residential building and worked with their electricians.  The conduit work they did was amazing and even though I'm a Master and that guy was a Journeyman, I fully admit that I was not half as good as he was.  On the other hand, he didn't have the first clue about how the Radio RA2 system we were installing there worked so I had to give him detailed schedules of where to put what switch legs and later helped out with light fixtures and such.  

Electricians like us are rare because it takes a lot of effort and money to be up to date with automation.  We've had to fly to and stay in Utah for a week to get trained in one company's system and later when they completely changed it, do it all again, and then for our efforts, 10 years later got dropped as a dealer when they were bought by another company who focused on sales.  We also spent thousands of dollars with Lutron training with all their systems and still with them. 

Unfortunately, the recent trend is for Audio/Video companies to do all the automation including the lighting so they are the ones who get trained with a dealer system and then have to show their electrician what to do so now you have TWO hands!  IMO This is mostly a result of all the DIY systems out there now causing the big dealer systems to panic and circle the wagons and push them to do more and more of the automation, even lighting which they are not equipped to do correctly (IMO).  

The good news is that Lutron at least offers a bunch of workshops for average electricians to install DIY programmable systems like Caseta. A lot of referrals we get are from the lighting store that sells them.  They trust us and we trust their judgement so ask whoever you buy your stuff to recommend an electrician they know.  If you don't know anybody, just google electrician, your city, and the product you want to install.  For us, that's the key words that pop up when someone is searching for us. I would stay away form audio video companies who say they do lighting because they often hire a non-contractor electrician buddy to do the line voltage stuff.

tankflykev,"I personally don’t trust Google or Amazon enough to put one of their microphones in my house. 

Always listening is somewhat of a misnomer as the device is only listening for the trigger word before it begins processing anything, but there have been some odd issues reported, particularly with Alexa where that doesn’t seem to actually be the case, most likely triggered by a minor bug, but nonetheless enough to turn me off. 

This said, I do have 3 HomePods in my house, the ability to just speak commands and have things happen is amazing, and on balance because “Hey Siri” on my phone is already set to be always listening it was less of an issue for me. 

Now in theory I should be just as paranoid about these devices, but to me the difference is that Apple isn’t a company that collects and uses my data to target advertisements to me, this issue alone is why I have vastly more trust in the HomePod than other devices.

fratdaddyZC,"&gt; one thing i hate about ""smart home"" stuff is the ""wifi enabled"" ? ? cant run a wire to it? it's not that hard. who the fuck cares about wifi? the only wifi thing i use is my phone.

Copper wire isn't secure.  What is stopping anyone from clamping and siphoning everything going in and out of your network?  You can make the argument for fiber, but as an American, I and many others don't have direct access to fiber to the house. Maybe energy should be spent fighting that fight rather than attacking wifi

&gt; why do i have to run on someone elses server?

You don't.  Only buy stuff compatible with local networks or different protocols.

&gt; with all the security issues we have seen in equifax , Facebook, and 100 different others companies, who would trust any of them.

​You shouldn't trust any of them, but since I'm assuming you've done your homework on those breaches, you also know that these companies are collecting data on you indirectly, and in ways that have nothing to do with wifi or smarthome devices.  I'm not saying you shouldn't care, and you make a good point to ensure people are wary of devices like the echo and google home collecting data. Data collection is not a smart home internet connected devices only thing.  You need to tell people to stop ordering things from amazon, stop using google chrome, stop talking to their friends using android devices, etc as well.  Also, the Equifax breach screwed a lot of people over that had 0 intention or direct affiliation with Equifax, which was the biggest deal of whole debacle. 

&gt; Wifi has been broken pretty much since it was invented.

WPA2 is 128bit AES encryption so... I'd love for you to expand on this point.  You say you have nothing but your phone, which I assume is on you at all times, connected to wifi.  What's stopping me from mugging you, taking your phone, stripping all the saved wifi hashes from it, and bruteforcing them?  The answer to that question is that it would take me lifetimes to crack that single wifi password from the hash if you have even a simply 'not great but ok' wifi password.

You kinda go off about how wifi is a terrible protocol, but then shift to attacking smarthome devices and their providers.  I don't know what you are trying to prove here, but I'll end by saying that these smart home setups accomplish 1 of 2 things or both for people. 1) its a fun hobby.  It's fun to automate stuff, and has been forever. Now you get to do it with your home. 2) It's a legitimate quality of life boost.  I'm a fallible human that either forgets or doesn't think/remember to turn off lights, set alarms, change thermostat settings to be efficient, etc.  Saving money on bills is cool, mood lighting is cool, turning off all the lights when I'm not home is cool... and its worth it to me to have these setups.  I imagine people with disabilities and handicaps might consider things absolutely necessary.  If you are trying to convince people to not have smart home technology, attacking wifi and mentioning companies collect data are probably not the best way to go about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The way I'm automating everything is through IFTTT 

&amp;#x200B;

These two things are in direct contradiction with each other. IFTTT is utterly unreliable, has random outages, and when it is ""working"", it makes zero guarantees on responsiveness. Sometimes an event will trigger something right away, other times it's a few seconds, other times is 30+ seconds. For things that don't really matter, it's fine. I use it to automate a few online things where getting a response even a few hours late doesn't really matter, but using it for home automation is a terrible idea. 

Something like ""when I get home, turn on these lights"" needs to be near instant, not 2 minutes after you've walked in and have already had to turn them all on manually. There's a lot of different ""glue"" systems out there to do all of the things you're using IFTTT for that work MUCH better in a real-time scenario, such as SmartThing or Home Assistant. I personally use Home Assistant, as it's vastly more powerful than SmartThings, but also more complicated. You can even tie it together with IFTTT to continue to do the things you already do, and move the things that have time-sensitivity to Home Assistant where you'll never experience random 30+ second delays.",1543788151,eaygd7t,t3_a2gto9,t3_a2gto9,/r/homeautomation/comments/a2gto9/newcomer_to_automation_looking_for_home_security/eaygd7t/,10,homeautomation

LukeHoersten,"HomeKit Devices work on your local network via IP and Bluetooth. So technically you can have your HomeKit smart devices with no internet. For accessing your devices from the internet, you have to bridge through a HomePod or AppleTv which Apple secures. This is a reduced attack surface facing the internet and controlled by Apple instead of OEM vendors. 

Alexa, and perhaps others, have each device talk to cloud services to perform actions. When each device uses the internet directly you increase the potential for bad security practice and have to trust each device. 

There are many other nuances details in HomeKit that make it a secure choice but it’s more technical.

drfalken,"I have had 5 for about 6 months. There are aspects that are fantastic. And there are aspects that are painful. 

Charging: buy the solar panels. If the area gets decent sun and low traffic that should be fine. This is a must if you don't want to recharge your cameras all the time. Or plug them in. This makes each camera 300$. 

Motion detection: wow they spent all this money on a tiny camera package but built them on a terrible PIR sensor. The motion detection is useless, and thusly, the batteries and the entire camera if it is pointed at a wall that has dancing shadows from trees in the wind. This is constant false positives which drain the batteries.  Worked with support and their attitude is basically: the sensor is working, correct?

They really can't be called a security product. With no SLA their cloud service is really unreliable. The day my order arrived and I upgraded to the paid plan, the service went down for 24 hours. And they were unable to solve the motion sensitivity part. The service has been better recently. But you should never depend on a security service that does not have a good SLA. 

amazon integration. Fantastic. From any tv in the house with a fire tv stick I can pick up the he voice remote and say: ""show me the front door"" and it will bring up the feed for the camera. We used one for a few mobthen. It was so nice we bought an Arlo Baby for our baby monitor. 

But the Amazon integration is terrible with the app. Every time Alexa discovers she duplicates the cameras and you have to delete all devices, which is no longer available on the mobile app, and rediscover. But their integration is terribly wasteful. Arlo Baby integrates with the camera itself. The Arlo base station has to stream to the cloud, then to Amazon, then back to your house. Leaving a 3 second delay and poor quality. They could stream direct. 

Am I in love? Kind of. Is it painful? Sometimes, mostly when it's important and Alexa says duplicate cameras or not responding. Do I regret it? Actually no. For what they are: expensive, well integrated, decent looking, tiny little cameras, they do an ok job. Would I trust them for a business use case? Never. Would I trust them to give me the impression that they had a missed opportunity to pick up that license plate number? Sometimes, when I don't have notification fatigue to dig through the last 500 library entries in the past hour.

foxleigh81,"If I was starting from scratch right now. I'd probably not buy as many of the consumer grade smart home things as they all need to phone home in order to work.

We had a brownout the other day and I had to wait ten minutes before my echo was usable again as the brownout took my internet connection down.

So I'd probably do the following:

- Centralised system using something like homeassistant
- A smart thermostat (brand isn't that relevant to me, so long as it works with homeassistant and can detect/change the temperature - I have a next v2 at the moment and that's fine)
- A centralised speaker/microphone system throughout the house (whole home audio is definitely going to be the future of voice assistants so might as well get one set up)
- TP link smart sockets (most reliable ones I've had and work great with homeassistant)
- Some standard IP CCTV cameras connected to Xeoma and homeassistant
- Door/window sensors for every door/window in my house (I'd probably make my own now but I do have some xeoma ones which work fine)
- Between 1 and 3 motion sensors in every room (larger rooms or rooms where people sit still work better with multiple sensors working together from my experience)
- Smart radiator valves so I can have heating zones
- Smart bulbs (I have Hue bulbs and Innr bulbs at the moment but Innr work just as well and are cheaper so i'd probably skip the hue ones) for the rooms where I'm interested in light temperature/colour.
- Smart switches (for rooms where I only care about on/off/dimmer)
- A smart doorbell/intercom (but I'd roll my own rather than purchase one)

For my voice assistant. I'd probably have a setup using Snips (https://snips.ai) connected in a central location to my whole house audio system, the only downside being that I'd have to either wait until someone creates a system which detects which microphone is being used, create one myself or use some other sort of room presence detection for things like 'Hey snips, turn off the lights' to work correctly in each room.

For that money, I'd rather buy a dumb appliance, a $30 plug that can tell me when it's done, and maybe a used car with the money I saved!",1541708545,e9ba7ty,t3_9vbo0p,t1_e9b8rlu,/r/homeautomation/comments/9vbo0p/new_home_ideas/e9ba7ty/,1,homeautomation
I_Arman,"I prefer Z-Wave over Zigbee, but they are both pretty decent; wifi is a pain, though. I'd get a hub that works with your Google Home, or if you're feeling adventurous, a Raspberry Pi with a USB Z-Wave stick, running OpenHAB or HomeAssistant. WiFi devices are cool and all, but they can clutter up your network and are sometimes really flaky. OpenHAB or HA should be able to run them just fine, though.

 - Install wired access points; if you're up for it, use a POE router (or injector) so you can run cameras, etc. on a single wire (RaspPi has a POE hat, so you can hook it into the same system).

 - Replace deadbolts with your choice of automated locks; get door and window sensors, and set up events for them - things like turning off the AC if a window is left open, turning on the lights when you open a door, or turning on a light, then turning it off a few minutes later when you leave.

 - If you have a garage, get a garage door open sensor and opener; with the right setup, you can open and close your garage door when your car gets in range, never have to hit a button at all.

 - Get at least one indoor motion sensor, and put it in a central area of the house. If it doesn't detect motion for 24 hours, it can set the house in ""away"" mode (power-saving temperature settings, lights on at random, etc.). Once it sees motion, it can ""wake up"" the house and set it back in ""home"" mode.

 - Set up security cameras. Inside and outside. Wired is better than wireless, battery backup is amazing. I don't have specific brand recommendations - I'm actually just starting this step myself.

 - Find a security system that works for you, and hopefully integrates with everything else. This is one that I still haven't managed. Best case, your smart stuff can piggyback on the dumb security system. I know companies like Vivint have smart offerings, but... don't do it. It's cheaper to have two systems running side by side than pay what they charge, trust me.

 - Get a whole-house energy meter, if you'd like; useful for monitoring what's running, when you use energy, etc. There are appliance and smaller energy meters, too, if you want.

 - Get some smart plugs; they may not seem useful, but when Christmas rolls around, it's nice to be able to turn on all the lights from your phone. Or for turning on those fancy lamps that the smart bulbs don't fit in. Or for... well, you get the idea.

 - Water leak alarms can be nice if you live in an area where burst pipes might be a problem. There are automated whole-house shutoff valves, too, if you're willing to spend the money on them - sure beats calling a neighbor to turn off your water if your frozen pipe bursts while you're away visiting family for Christmas.

 - And thinking of water, if you have a watering system, you can hook that up to your smart house too, be it shutoff adapters with wifi or whole systems dedicated to it.

 - Integrate your TV (smart TV, Google Chromecast, other similar systems) into your system, so when you turn on your TV, it dims the lights. This is why you'd want HA or OpenHAB, for the ability to fully customize stuff like this!

 - *Don't* buy a smart fridge. There are a lot of them out there, and almost all of them have problems. Get a dumb fridge, and if you really need it to be smart, put a temperature sensor inside. Be careful with buying a smart oven, washing machine, etc.; they are usually super expensive and a *lot* more prone to breaking down. Before you get any ""smart"" appliance, check if there's a different way to make it smart. Want to see if your dryer is running? Sure, you could get a ""smart dryer""... or your could get a reliable one and an energy meter.

 - Stay flexible, and read reviews. There are a lot of cool things out there that really aren't any good, and a lot of things that you have no idea how you would even use that you realize you can't live without.

 - Budget, because once you start adding stuff, you won't be able to stop, because it's all so cool, and when those RGBW controllers go on sale, you can't help but get two...",1541703825,e9b46i9,t3_9vbo0p,t3_9vbo0p,/r/homeautomation/comments/9vbo0p/new_home_ideas/e9b46i9/,7,homeautomation

danemacmillan,"I use the previous generation and it’s fantastic. In terms of just raw hardware security, it’s ANSI/BHMA rating is grade 2, with 1 being the best. Maybe this latest generation has a 1. Schlage deadbolts are rated 1.

I trust Yale because they’ve been in the lock business for almost two centuries. They’re not just going to pack up and leave if they lose a round of startup funding. They also operate Assa Abloy, and a few other world-renowned lock companies, which have stood the test of time. Assa Abloy currently makes the most secure deadbolt/lock system in the world, the Abloy Protec 2; it has never been broken into. This is a lock that makes it more feasible to break the wall around the door instead of trying to break the lock.

They also just bought August smart locks. 

Yale is very serious about locks. This is *their* industry, and has been for a long time.

I personally went with keyless because it’s one less avenue to exploit. While it does not have grade 1 security, I like to think there are far fewer software hackers with knowledge to open the lock than people who can tinker with the key opening, tumblers, etc. At the end of the day, they’re going to need to sledgehammer the lock off if they need to get inside.

Yale solved the problem of the battery dying, which all other companies are starting to do. The solution: a 9v underneath and out of the way of the keypad.

Yale also supports all the popular home automation protocols, like Zigbee, zwave, HomeKit, etc, just by installing a module.

It’s a great system. I trust it to keep my family and belongings secured.

InovelliUSA,"Hey u/mires9,

Thanks for the kind words, that sincerely means a lot :)

As for the restocking of scene switches, thanks for the patience here and I know it's frustrating (trust me, I'm probably equally as frustrated... it's been a real ""fun"" ride with the manufacturer) but we're actually in the middle of negotiations with them and this has caused some of the delays. We hope to have this sorted out by mid-November in which they'll ship the switches we've ordered (they've already been produced, we're just waiting on a few things to be finalized).

What you could do is reach out to me via PM (or shoot an email to [contact@inovelli.com](mailto:contact@inovelli.com)) and check to see if we have any refurbished in stock at our HQ.  I just checked the internal inventory and it looks like we have about 20 of them checked in, so we could certainly sell you those (which come with the same lifetime warranty and also have been checked by either myself or our team to make sure they work properly).

So, if I had to take a best guess, I would imagine brand new ones to be available in a month or so (pending all goes well with the negotiations) but if you need them sooner (and a bit cheaper) you could go down the refurbished route.

Thanks again for all your support and kind words and have an awesome night!

illiteratem8,"So I'm a big fan of starting with a bigger picture and going smaller. You need a hub that will control your smart home. Smartthings is a great choice for someone who doesn't necessarily want to tinker, but wants to do some more advanced things. It's inexpensive, can be purchased nearly anywhere, offers iOS and Android apps, and ties in with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. HomeAssistant, HomeSeer, and others are great systems for tinkerers but require a certain mindset and knowhow to operate.

What's great about smartthings is it has z-wave and zigbee radios built into it, so you can expand your house with all kinds of sensors. For example, I have Smartthings and sensors on my doors, windows, outlets I control, and much more. [Here is the door and window sensors I use](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=24259) to be notified as soon as my doors open and close, [here is the outlets I use to control my lamp and cameras](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=27481), and I also have lights hooked up that I can control as well.

I use my smartthings hub as a makeshift security systems. So whenever a door or window opens, I get notified. If my front door opens between 9 PM and midnight, my kitchen light turns on. If any window or door opens between midnight and 6 AM, all of my lights come on. I also have two indoor cameras hooked up to z-wave outlets (listed above) which I have on between certain hours (when we're not home), so I can easily see if someone comes in or doesn't stop by (ahem, maintenance).

To get started with the front door sensor, you're looking at around $100 with a hub and sensor. You can then expand easily, and trust me, you'll want to. You could even get this [smartthings starter kit and secure more than just your front door](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-F-MN-Monitoring-White/dp/B076HFQ2B9/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540251932&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=smartthings&amp;dpID=41jL9-rykzL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch)",1540251520,e89lwz8,t3_9qiqp8,t3_9qiqp8,/r/homeautomation/comments/9qiqp8/best_sensor_to_ensure_front_door_is_closed/e89lwz8/,4,homeautomation

InovelliUSA,"Thanks for the shoutout /u/eternal_peril \- that really means a lot :)

/u/GForce_79 \-- building on the comment above, let me see if I can help a bit as maybe I can save you from making a lot of the mistakes I did when I first started.

I second the statement around smart light bulbs. I decked out my entire house with smart bulbs only to realize that they were cool, but as soon as you cut the power to them, they're basically useless (as they need power to communicate to the HUB). However, I do have some Hue lights leftover as I do like the color (mood-lights and my girls love the color lights at bedtime).

If you do go with smart bulbs, I'm a fan of the Hue's and there's a couple options to get around the, ""cutting power rendering the bulb useless"" issue. Philips makes a remote that you can put on the wall that controls the bulbs. Just maybe put a sign or something by the switch to make sure no one turns the physical switch or lamp off. We (Inovelli) also make smart switches that you can disable the internal relay so that you can send a signal from the smart switch to the HUB for you to ""turn on the smart bulb"" and vice versa and not physically cut power to the bulb. But I would only use this if you absolutely want some color bulbs. It would be overkill to have smart bulbs and switches all over the house!

I'd recommend to start replacing your smart switches if you're going to start somewhere. Reason being is they can still be used as normal switches (ie: physically turning them on/off) but also can be used remotely. This way people who are not familiar with your smart home won't mess anything up :)

There are lots of great brands and switches out there and I'm happy to help answer any questions about anyone you're interested in as I (and pretty much everyone on the team) have all the major brands in our houses. I'm biased to Z-Wave as it's the only protocol that won't interfere with your WiFi signal, but ZigBee is decent too. Just stick to the name-brands there if you can.

To answer your Google Home question... the only protocol that works with GH is WiFi unless you have a HUB (such as SmartThings, Hubitat, Wink, HomeSeer, etc). When you add a HUB, you gain the functionality of Z-Wave, ZigBee and in some cases Bluetooth and can also do a lot more advanced settings if you have a HUB (ie: set bulbs to come on based on motion detection at certain times of day).

Hope this all makes sense?

**NET:**

* If you want a basic Smart House, Google Home will work just fine (ie: turn lights on and off via voice) -- if you want a customized smart home, add a HUB (and connect that HUB to Google Home)
* Start with smart switches and not bulbs -- just trust me on this one
* Have fun!

Have a great night!

Then Facebook, Apple, Google, etc probably know that you're in very close proximity to a few other people. They probably decided with a high degree of confidence that you are co-workers or friends, which means you must chat. If you chat, you chat about your interests. These companies already know you play game X because your game company sold you out. If they know that person Z likes games as well, which they probably found out from Microsoft or some other game provider, then they put 2 and 2 together.

TL/DR

Info Known: Person X and Person Z both like videogames, and Person X likes Game Y a ton and Person Z has never played Game Y at all (this info is obtained separately, beforehand, from the game companies)

Info Gathered: Person X and Person Z are friends/co-workers (determined with location data)

industrialprogress,"Dear Mr. Sir,

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.

In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access the his trust fund we need your assistance.

threeyearstoRE,"So I have 9 Hue Lights (Strips, A19 and BR30) and 8 Lifx Lights (BR30)..here are my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I have all of the A19s and BR30s attached to smart Zwave dimmer switches and this creates some complexities as the use of the wall switches to control these lights is jarring. I find myself using alexa commands more often than not to turn lights off.....great for us normal inhabitants but confuses guests.

\- The LIFX and Hue smart bulbs do not do well in dimmer situations and actually are much better in a dumb switch or non-dimmer environment. I have tried to update my Device Handlers via ST to shorten on/off times but I cant get anything that executes locally and my experience has not been great.

\- The HUE bulbs often get a black eye because of the HUB requirement, but honestly, the wall mounted switch is a godsend and my whole kitchen is 'Hued' and controlled with this one switch...I cant do that easily with the LIFX.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Lifx does have much better brightness and color accuracy and saturation. It's dramatic how much better they are in that regard. Still....the setup is a pain in the ass and they've reset a few times on me. They also require 2.4GHZ wifi band and dont act as repeaters (for obvious reasons) which precipitated the need for a new mesh WIFI system in my house.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The LIFX app is better and more flashy but trust me, the initial 'color' mania will die off quickly and you'll want something that just works. Yes it's nice to have some ambient flicker when winding down or watching a movie but I would rather not have to go into an app, period.

&amp;#x200B;

On the whole, I may be a dissenter amid the lighting folks around here....I think LIFX is a better bulb...but the HUE is simply a better experience provided you have less than 50 devices and you have range with your hub.

&amp;#x200B;

My takeaway here though is something more.....profound....I think I would advocate smart dimmers and a good dimmable LED bulb like a CREE with lots of lumens and the color you like for your house. It's much easier to setup automation that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep the 'color' splashes focused to specific use cases (single room like theater or office or lamp) and get ready to lose your lust for RGB fairly quickly......

distantreplay,"My story: Former commercial/golf field technical service rep for a major manuf. of irrigation central control systems and current owner of Rachio. 

I think your choice should be driven mostly by your expectations. It probably isn't safe to assume that everyone, especially homeowners, have similar expectations when it comes to how their sprinklers are run. As with irrigation central control, the principal advantages of a ""smart enabled"" irrigation controller will come down to scheduling efficiency and convenience.

As for convenience, the ability to activate and modify remotely using a mobile app can have obvious advantages. And the cost of these systems has come down enough so that alone may be worth the investment.

But coming from my background I see the biggest advantage being soil/crop based scheduling combined with fully automated weather based scheduling adjustments. Depending on your local climate more than half of efficiency losses to scheduling are due to periodic weather variation. A system that captures  weather data to update scheduling in real time without user intervention has proven to be the only reliable way to limit those efficiency losses.

I honestly haven't bothered to research much about most other new systems since I purchased Rachio three years ago. I would assume many have very comparable features and performance. Rachio permits a scheduling method based on general soil characteristics, general crop type, general solar exposure, sprinkler precipitation rate, and modifications like in-cycle soak time for expansive clay soil types or steep slopes. Users who don't want to get into the weeds (no pun intended) on this stuff can use only the features they understand or are comfortable with. My experience so far is that the scheduling performance is essentially equal IRL to the large scale central control systems I used to support with costs starting around $50k. 

Rachio pulls data from Weather Underground in combination with local NWS recording stations. In general it's a pretty good data set. But depending on local climate it may not perform as well as a dedicated on site weather data collecting array, particularly a tipping rain can sensor. And things can vary. I'll say quite honestly that some of the NWS stations are not well maintained and have obviously faulty data arrays. The most common out of spec data points are often the most critical to irrigation scheduling: solar radiation and rainfall. I started noticing periodic drought stress and traced it to the local ""preferred"" weather station I had selected. Both the average solar radiation data and average rainfall data were quite off and had been for some time. I chose a different local station and the problem went away.

As you can see here, there are other reasons for wanting a ""smart"" irrigation controller. Quite a few of the folks responding have implemented a DIY solution with off the shelf components that gives them all the convenience. But I would suspect that unless they are a pretty talented code writer and have a rather exceptional understanding of principles of irrigation scheduling (at least for the average software engineer) they aren't doing anything with their systems to drive scheduling efficiency. And that's fine. In my experience that's exactly what a lot of people want. I worked with golf courses that, after dropping a hundred grand on high tech control gear, turned around and ran almost everything manually from their remotes. Because they like it that way, they didn't trust the weather station, and it made them feel better to be personally ""in control"". 

So my advice would be to assess your expectations first, before spending any money.",1537628353,e6fsgee,t3_9hw4c8,t3_9hw4c8,/r/homeautomation/comments/9hw4c8/talk_to_me_about_smart_irrigation/e6fsgee/,2,homeautomation

Water is conductive, and that means in a non non conductive container capacitive sensing will likely work. I like capsense because there's no extra parts, just two wires and the microcontroller. But two wires may not be ideal mechanically, and a weight sensor underneath may be better.

Be careful with the mechanical aspects of this, even with non contact. Glue is rarely quite as strong as we want it to be, screws loosen, etc. ",1535795202,e57dj4p,t3_9bzlkg,t3_9bzlkg,/r/homeautomation/comments/9bzlkg/will_a_water_sensor_pbc_be_safe_to_put_in_my_dogs/e57dj4p/,2,homeautomation

quixotic120,"I have a samsung door sensor (SmartThings hub) on my front door which turns on the lights in that area and then detection of cell phones to determine “I’m home”. I did have the Samsung arrival sensor but I found it was about on par with just using phones. It was slightly faster but we tend to always have our phones whereas we don’t bring keys on walks and stuff because the door lock and deadbolt are biometric/passcode

The door sensor works very quickly but the batteries don’t last terribly long. I’ve considered wiring a 3v power supply to it but I really don’t feel like tearing up the walls to hide wiring or using wire tracks because my girlfriend considers them very ugly. The phone detection is much slower, can easily take 30+ seconds, but we don’t use it for much besides climate (which is also scheduled so it’s less noticeable unless were off our normal schedules). We did have more lighting control at one point (like automating living area lights coming on/not coming to a dark home)

I would like to explore ways of room detection but I haven’t had the time. My ideal setup is something like detecting position of us within the house (motion detectors would work if we didn’t have pets, cell phones don’t get carried around as much in the evening) that combined with time of day/weather/our sleep schedules would fully automate lighting. Like if I walk into the kitchen during an overcast day its lit a certain way, if I go into the bathroom at night soft lighting, etc. 

The big things we don’t have that would impact this are a security system that arms and internet connected locks. If we had those it would be handy to do things like auto arm the system and ensure doors are locked upon leaving. However, we don’t see the need for a fancy security system in our current home (we do have one cheap camera in the entrance), and we don’t fully trust the idea of connecting entrance locks to the internet (versus local connection to fob/phone via Bluetooth/rfid/whatever) but that’s probably a bit paranoid",1534963187,e4nb2bh,t3_99enbh,t3_99enbh,/r/homeautomation/comments/99enbh/arriving_home_triggers_latency_issues_is_your/e4nb2bh/,2,homeautomation
gemini-rx,"Phyn was installed into my home last week. The fancy box it comes in has all the parts needed to install it. The company prints a personalized welcome letter which was a neat touch. The plumber who installed it for me had not installed this product before but had the system put on in less than an hour (a person with experience with installation could probably do it in 30 mins). Installation was very intuitive and not overly complicated for the plumber. My only critique for the install process was I thought the installation instructions were a little too simplistic and left out some critical details. For example, it would have been really helpful to have known that the cord on the mounting base could be detached from the device itself (I had to call the product support line to find this detail out). We also had some plastic clips in the box that the plumber and I didn’t quite understand where they went. My recommendation to Phyn would be to put some graphics in the instructions which indicate part locations and cord detachment areas (that would be a huge plus). On the very positive side, the product support line is easily accessible and there’s always a helpful, pleasant person on the other end to help with any questions. I’ve emailed them a number of product questions and I’ve always received a response within 1 business day. In summary - customer support for Phyn is excellent....so factor that in into any competitor choice you make. There is a cool looking LED light on the device for those that like asthetics. In my understanding, the earlier software versions had the light staying on all the time but in current version I find the light never turns on with the exception of when you are testing the device to shut the water off. An interesting app upgrade for Phyn to consider would be having the customer decide in the app how they wish the light to operate (it would be neat for it to come on when flow detected in my opinion). 

In the welcome letter they do indicate their intention for Phyn to be a good house guest. The Phyn device does deliver on this promise because I have received less than 5 questions from the device about water use inquires in the last week which is not intrusive for me. These inquires are usually things such as a large water use that Phyn wants to understand better (and learn). The Phyn app is quite easy to use and gives constant read of pressure, flow and temperature. The pressure read is a nice feature because I do not have a pressure regulator valve on my lines. My understanding is that ensuring pressure not too high on a chronic basis can save appliances (I believe pressures over 80 psi are only problematic but I am not a plumber - so don’t quote me on that). The app allows you to switch units between metric and imperial which is useful but it would be nice for that app to allow you to customize each item for metric or imperial (few peeps I know measure pressure in bars where I live). For those individuals that question the accuracy of your water meter, the Phyn app does keep track of your hourly, daily and monthly water use. I have not had the device long enough to scrutinize if my water usage on the bill matches the Phyn. 
My motivation for buying this device was primarily for monetary reasons and peace of mind  (the same reason the insurance industry has high interest in the device). I am not interested in replacing my polyB lines in my house yet if they are not leaking....so this device is giving me (and my insurer) a little peace of mind (like I mentioned before - I am saving $160 a year now on premiums). If you’ve never had to deal with a shady remediation company or leak in the past then you haven’t  learned to appreciate early water leak detection yet. Those with that experience will gladly pay that $850 for damage avoidance in the future (although I balk at paying a monthly fee that one of the competitor products wants you to pay). The question remains on what the device longevity is for Phyn. If the device lasts as long as a water meter does then the device will eventually pay for itself. If the components fail and the device needs frequent replacement then costs could play in. My recommendation to Phyn is to keep the device size exactly the same going into the future because the way my unit is installed now, I could swap in a new unit without a plumber (all I would need is a wrench to unscrew the unit and screw a new one in). I chose this product over the competitors primarily because I trust the names behind the manufacturing of this product (Uponor is top of the plumbing industry and Belkin (now owned by Foxconn) is also well reknown for electronics. 

In my opinion these devices are not the end all and be all of leak detection. I still recommend strategic placement of smaller leak detection units. For example, I had a washing machine that that was leaking about a tablespoon of water on my floor with every spin cycle (water coming from the drum during the spin). Phyn wasn’t installed at the time but it likely won’t catch leaks like this. The tail on my Lyric water sensor which I tuck under my fridge and washer is what caught that tablespoon sized leak.

Honestly, both systems will run around the same cost, and I can't deny that there is a bit of a secure feeling in having everything hosted locally..   I've got no skin in this game, except to say that having freshly reviewed Brultech's way of managing things, it's emphatically not for me.  I'll go into a bit more detail, but honestly go with whatever you think works best for you.

Curb's installation for me was easier because you have those three terminal blocks (6 each, total of 18 leads per Curb) and you could prewire the terminal blocks and label/number these ahead of the installation.. so you simply clamp the CT down on the circuits and when you have all 6 done, you plug the terminal block into the curb and voila.  Plus the Curb can live inside the circuit panel box no problem.   I ran ethernet to my panel boxes and I was done, or they give you powerline ethernet adapters.  By comparison the Gem requires you to wire each CT individually.  Big thing for me was how crazy complicated it is to setup and update the Dashbox and the Gem, and how manual it is.  This is completely not an issue with Curb, it's all automated.  All the setup for Curb is done via the website, and it's about as easy as it gets.  It took me a half hour of data entry and I was set.  And I enjoy having an actual iPhone/Android app, vs trying to get the website to display properly on a mobile browser.

I am still working on windows and need to add a few glass break sensors.  I also have a doorbell camera on each of my 3 exterior entrances with motion alerting enabled.  Overall I trust that I will know if anybody is on my property or trying to get into my house while I'm away.  

Depending on where you fall on the paranoia spectrum, you will be fully aware of the weak points of your system which should drive you to constantly improve.   Regarding the SD failure scenario... you should boot your Pi to an external drive instead of using the SD card.  The card is still necessary to boot, but booting to the external drive will significantly reduce reads and writes to the SD card.  This should result in much longer life.  Also, get a UPS to protect against power failures.

I love it that Alexa can tell me exactly which sensor was tripped during the night (repeating 5 times so I'm sure to hear it and wake up).

LiveMike78,"For a few reasons I'd speculate:

* Lights are most likely the entry point for people who're considering first time home automation due to simplicity and exposure.
* Home automation &amp; voice controlled often get confused, and lights play nicely with Alexa.
* There are clear market leaders for lighting, making people comfortable with investing in a known system/brand.
* More interesting home automation probably equates to more complicated.
* Automated lighting is the easiest for people to understand and see the benefits.
* Most automated lighting will continue to work offline. For example, if you turn off and on a switch to a Hue bulb it will come on - its low risk of leaving you without control.
* Trust - as others have commented, you'd need to have a high degree of trust to install smart locks.
* While bulbs may be expensive per bulb starter kits are usually affordable enough to entice people into the system. Bulbs can be incrementally installed, meaning - while the overall cost is high - it isn't a one-time investment.
* Lighting is more than simply illuminating a space - it offers security, safety, comfort and even communication:
   * Security, scheduling lighting so it appears someone is home may deter home invaders. Motion sensors provide traditional security lighting functionality.
   * Safety, in an emergency you can have all the lights come on automatically (for example, if a fire is detected).
   * Comfort, colours/brightness/etc can be adjusted based on the time of day or activities. For example, the colour temperature of the bulbs can become warmer as the ambient light becomes darker. This can reduce eye strain.
   * Communication, blink the lights to let your partner know you got to your destination safely. Change the colour of the lights when your favourite team is playing.

Blitherakt,"/u/firemandave6024 pretty much hit it.

I can't verify the coding standards, security algorithms, and other stuff like that in a lock mass-produced in a Chinese factory by the lowest bidder, not do I have the confidence that the locks will be upgraded with any regulatory if a vulnerability is found. [This story] (https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/7/3739364/onity-keycard-hack-replacement) has been recurring for at least six years, and that's in a commercial space where the constraints are physical. 

I really don't want somebody with a high-gain antenna being able to grab the key exchange on my Bluetooth lock or, God forbid, some guy in Russia getting ahold of the cloud certificate used to authenticate my phone unlock app over the internet. 

At least with a physical device there's a much lower attack surface: you have to be physically present and in direct proximity to the lock in order to breach it. When you remove the physical constraint, you open up the avenues of attack considerably.

I'm a programmer. I don't trust myself to secure something well enough, and I at least think like an attacker. I know enough other programmers to know that I'm in the minority.

tripflex,"So first, i'm in the same boat you are, i'm actually a full time developer, previous net/sys admin for govt contractor, and i'm actually a Ubiquity fanboy as well (i have a wireless network, and CCTV system that rivals most company setups).

Anyways, I did the same research you did, and actually settled on SmartThings, specifically because of the very large community surrounding it, and because of how many things are supported (either natively, or through installable device handlers, apps, etc).

HomeSeer looks like it also has a good large community surrounding it ... ***but being completely honest*** .... I stayed away because the main website, and forums are completely ugly ... and that is only what the end user sees ... who knows what any kind of backend code they have looks like, which worries me even more!  While yes, I would prefer to have time/money spent on functionality, it still makes me question whether or not HomeSeer was super popular say .. 10 years ago, but fell off and is why their forum theme is still stuck in early 2000 ... do they not make enough money to just spend $50 on a forum theme, or a new WordPress theme that matches the current trends?  And what does that mean any UI I use of theirs is going to look like ... probably super ugly as well.  The major benefit though is absolutely going to be everything handled locally, but I just couldn't get past my first initial impression.  This of course, is my own personal opinion ... but being a developer it raises a lot of questions like, do they not have enough people on staff to spend a day making stuff look nicer?  I know they say don't judge a book by its cover ... but we all do, and that was something I just couldn't get over.

***If there's one thing I can say to anyone from HomeSeer*** ... if I walk into a room where two companies are trying to pitch me something ... if one of them is wearing a suite and tie, clean cut and shaved ... and the other looks like they just rolled out of bed, and are wearing clothes from 10+ years ago ... chances are i'm going to trust the one wearing the suite and tie more, because if anything ... if shows that they care about appearance.  I'm not trying to hate, i'm trying to provide legit consumer feedback as to why I did not consider HomeSeer.

Now yes, the majority of SmartThings is handled through the cloud, which is my only real gripe with ST (being as though I know networking like back of my hand, and there's no reason they shouldn't have already integrated some local communication stuff) ... but in the past 2+ years i've been using SmartThings there's only been once or twice where SmartThings was down, but besides that it's reliable ... enough to where I haven't switched to anything else with all the options out there.

Because I use the Smart Home Monitor for basic security system, and I use Google's Project Fi for cell service, I just purchased a Netgear LTE modem router (\~$40), ordered a SIM card from Project Fi, and connected that, along with my UPS backup, to the SmartThings system.   Reason being is, i've had more issues with my home internet going out, than I have ever had with SmartThings ... having the LTE backup allows me to still connect even if my home internet goes down.  I've never had an instance where I was unable to disarm my system because of SmartThings being down ... and I use my alarm system everyday.

Majority of my lights are Hue lights, so I can either control them through SmartThings or just using the Hue app (which is what i normally do, now that their Android app doesn't suck as much as it used to).  I use different apps developed by community for managing door lock codes for myself, friends, and AirBnB renters, etc.

I also have Google Home devices so majority of my lights I just tell Google to turn on or off, and works without problems ... directly through SmartThings, with only having to set them up in SmartThings and Google automatically detects them (this includes my chinese brand zwave relays for pool light, etc).

So take everyone's hate on SmartThings with a grain of salt, because they have either .. had issues with it previously, work for a competitor, or had issues and couldn't figure out how to fix it themselves ... but that's the best part, there's such a large community it's not hard to get support when you need it .. which is exactly why I chose ST over anything else.

One of my favorite things i've found for SmartThings is the webcore rules engine, works great and is constantly receiving new features and updates ([https://wiki.webcore.co/](https://wiki.webcore.co/))

Didn't expect my response to be this long but guess I had a bit to say ... basically you're going to find both sides of the spectrum and it really depends on your specific use case scenario.  My original idea was the same as yours, to run my home automation system on one of my home servers, but I have yet to find anything out there that I was happy with, and so far ST has been sufficient enough for me, especially since I use it as an alarm system along with home automation system.

***EDIT:*** to answer the subject of your question though, I would say HomeSeer (even though I have not used it), as local based handling is always going to be more reliable than cloud based ... unless you're not home, then you have to use the cloud

Of course sometimes it is your product that broke compatibility and Device X got a firmware update to keep your gizmo from crashing theirs.

Building a home, no budget - the best advice I can give is to prioritize running wire, as much as you can.  Copper is king while the walls are open, and when you have the budget later, you will find your options far more limited without a lot of CAT6 in the wall.   Speaker wire tacked in every room, 5.1 in media room, CAT6 to TV location in ALL ROOMS (even if you don't think you want a TV in that room), doorbell area, etc... Drop CAT6 everywhere, and have your prewire guys document and photograph where each drop is.

Trust me.  If it comes down to choosing between a new IOT device and running a few extra drops, run the wire, buy the IOT later.  You can't do it the other way around.

coogie,"The biggest advice I can give you is unless you're a millionaire who does complete home remodels every 5-10 years and doesn't care how much things cost is to keep your lights and your AV separate. It's tempting to tie everything together to the point where you can't even recognize a light switch/keypad from the volume control and thermostat, but from my experience, AV trends come and go while your lights always need to work.

After 5 years, no matter what system you have, parts will start to fail, you may have a broken bulb that blows out a dimmer, etc. and if you have everything tied together, you'll have to not just find an electrician, but also an AV dealer who is certified with all your various systems to tie everything back together. 

 I'm a Homeworks Certified installer and got a call from someone who had bought a house that had HW and crestron tied together but only had crestron touch screens. He said his lights weren't working and I told him there was nothing I could do for him because I'm not a Crestron dealer.  So now he has to find a Crestron Dealer who is also a HW dealer,or perhaps one that knows a HW dealer and they'll both charge him through the nose. 

I think the better way is to have your standalone lighting system like Ra2 or Homeworks, and use their keypads and only link other systems to it as a secondary way of control so that way, if your lighting goes out, you'll have a much easier time of finding someone who can fix your lighting without affecting the other thing (you can keep the same addressing).  There are also a lot more electricians who are certified with Lutron than any other system so it's a one stop shop type of thing.  Also, you'll be free to change your AV later without affecting your lights.

**Panels vs. traditional wiring:**

As someone who started out with panelized systems and thought they were the greatest thing and were going to change home building, I have to warn  you against them so you know the risk:  

In the early 2000's there were 3 big names: Lutron Homeworks, Vantage Qlink, and LiteTouch.  All the time, all 3 companies were actively trying to get new dealers and sell them on the idea of a centralized system and how amazing the technology was.  And it WAS amazing.  Instead of rows and rows of dimmers, you'd just have a keypad and the dimming was done remotely in an equipment room.

At the time, these were cash cows for dealers, decorators loved them because it saved wall-space, and it was a status symbol and you'd only see them in multi-million dollar houses where much like buying a Benz, the owner could afford to call the dealer to fix things.

The problem with these systems however is that there is a single point of failure and all 3 systems had their own proprietary way of doing things.  Vantage used 2 conductors 16 awg wire, Lutron had a 4 conductor, and LiteTouch had 3 conductors.  Not to mention that the Lutron RPMs don't work with Vantages dimming modules nor with LiteTouch's.  

This means that you are 100% dependent on not just the company being in business but that you'll have a decent dealer in your area that can service it when things go wrong, and it's a WHEN, not an IF. Sooner or later, that processor/master controller is going to die.

There have been dozens of times when I've gone to a house that had a Vantage system and they couldn't turn on a single light in the house because the processor had died. If they were within the warranty period, we could send it in for repair but they'd be out luck for a week or two unless I had a spare processor I could lend them.  I've seen this a  few times with Lutron as well but in their case, it's mostly the power supply that dies so I can at least get them going until I find an official power supply wheareas Vantage's power supply is built in. 

So with this sort of ticking timebomb, you better hope the companies and dealers stick around, but they haven't.  LiteTouch was bought by Savant a few years ago and they put an end to the system.  Poof! 

I worked in $4million houses that have LiteTouch and they are completely without support. They can't even use LED bulbs in most cases because their dimming modules predate them. 

So now there are just Vantage and Lutron that have panels, at least from the old school companies.  Lutron has always done lighting and doesn't do AV but Vantage started with lighting and wants so bad to be in the same league as Crestron and Crestron has always been an AV company that wants to get into lighting so personally, i don't trust Vantage for AV and I don't trust Crestron for lighting because I don't think that's their DNA. 

Lutron isn't going anywhere because they are a huge private company and have cash coming in, and Vantage was bought by Legrand a few years ago but I'm not so sure about them because they went from a scrappy and friendly company and essentially turned into jerks and got rid of a lot of great dealers so I would not even consider them. We had to turn down a customer whom we would go out of our way to help with their vantage system because Vantage said we weren't selling enough. Service didn't matter to them. All that mattered were sales.

Right now, Lutron is still trying to get dealers to be trained in their systems, but the AV places are circling the wagons against the DIY systems and kicking out dealers that aren't 100% committed to their particular system so that's bad news in the future.  

TLDR;

I'd stick with either Radio Ra2 or Homeworks (either wireless or otherwise non-central) for lighting.  Either hide the dimmers locally in a closet or pantry or something or just keep the wiring 100% traditional. That way, if something happens to the processor you're still back to local controls. If the companies go out of business, you'll still have local controls and can migrate to another system much easier. 

For AV, pick your favorite dealer and whatever system they have. It won't matter, they're all about the same, but Crestron and C4 are probably the most expensive. Ask them to link up to your lighting.  

If at all possible, have the electrician do the lighting and not the AV company. They're not electricians and come from a different mindset. ",1528725511,e0hgvzu,t3_8q5zvb,t3_8q5zvb,/r/homeautomation/comments/8q5zvb/seek_advise_new_home_construction_automation_hire/e0hgvzu/,2,homeautomation

I certainly am not here for free stuff, though I am trying to manage a smart home without breaking the bank. 

If I'm being honest and frank, the lay-homeowner does not have a good time finding out for his or herself about your company's experience, how well respected they are, etc. The website is not particularly appealing as compared to competitors, I can't find many reviews online of your product, and I have to just trust your product is superior for a non-trivial base-cost.

InovelliUSA,"Hey /u/automate_the_things -- funny, I was reading this comment and thought, ""man, I had the exact same thought process -- I like this person""

I remember back in January when we launched the smart switches and we were super excited about the scene firmware and thought, ""oh yeah, these switches are amazing"". Then came the customer service tickets and they read, ""your smart switches won't work with our smart bulbs"". Initially I chuckled and thought, ""now, why in the world are people putting smart bulbs on our smart switches... seems ridiculous"". I literally had the same reasoning as you. I started with the GE Link bulbs back in the day and outfitted my entire house with Quirky Tapt switches that could talk to the bulbs and turn them on/off when they worked. 

But, the emails kept coming in, ""I tried dimming my smart bulb and it didn't work very well with your switch"" or ""every time I turn off your smart switch, it turns off my smart bulb rendering it useless"".

It got us wondering -- why are people using both smart bulbs and smart switches? Then we finally asked and what it boiled down to is that they wanted to change the colors of the bulbs. More than often it was exterior bulbs that were connected to an interior switch. So, to solve for this, we created the option to disable the internal relay and have the switch send a command to the Hub, which then turns the light on and off and thus, does not cut power to the bulb.

Now, don't laugh at me, but I've now become a believer in the disable relay feature and connecting my smart bulbs to my smart switch. My girls love their Hue bulbs. They enjoy having different color lights when they go to bed. Now, I've disabled the relay in their rooms and when they tap the switch 1x Up, it turns the lights on to the last setting.

kaidomac,"The problem with mounting a tablet on a fridge is power, so then it turns into a recurring chore to charge it daily.  I've been through multiple iterations of how to solve this problem myself over the last decade, starting with cookbooks, and then 3\-ring binders of written &amp; printed recipes, then a chalkboark \(yay for liquid chalk!\), and then my laptop \(messy fingers &amp; keyboard keys = nope, plus there's a risk of spilling fine stuff like flour or liquids on it\), then an iPad \(not bad, but not customizable &amp; got swiped for play\-time usage outside of the kitchen, lol\), then a small 4K Roku TV, which had a Chromestick &amp; then a mini PC driving it, and currently a 10"" Fire HD tablet.

The Fire tablet is nice because it's relatively cheap compared to an equivalent\-sized iPad &amp; it has hands\-free Alexa, which is super useful for stuff like cookie timers or measurement conversions when your hands are busy or messy.  It sits on a metal tilt stand, so I can move it around the kitchen as necessary to look at recipes, and uses a simple USB cable and A/C adapter for charging.  You can get the Google Play Store running on it pretty easily as well.  For lists, we use the Todoist app \(which can share lists to smartphones\), so you can quickly capture stuff like grocery items while you're in the kitchen.  You can lock down the interface if you'd like \(for example, if you don't want it being used for games or surfing\) with a third\-party launcher or something like SureLock Kiosk, although it is nice having stuff like the Youtube app on it if you're bored waiting for something to cook for a few minutes or whatever.  Plenty of finger\-painting apps available as well!

We do limit usage for primarily kitchen stuff to, so while there are some games on it to use if you're killing time in the kitchen, the tablet is not allowed to grow legs &amp; leave the kitchen \- it stays plugged in \(unless being actively used at the dinner table or on another counter or whatever, but then goes right back to the portable stand &amp; plugged into the kitchen outlet\).  That way it's always available to be used as intended, because otherwise trust in using it would diminish over time if you need to pull a recipe up &amp; someone is off on some recliner somewhere playing on it.

Voice recognition on hardware doesn’t need to understand every accent. Only it’s users which can be trained and run reduced datasets. Research has proven that years ago.

And no video system since the 80’s stores that much video. Everything is trigger based. It only detects motion. So 32GB would easily cover someone’s front door with a multi-week rotation.

I avoid Alexa like the plague. I don’t for a second believe nobody has cracked these things. People insisted home routers were secure for years if you set a password, but let’s be honest, we all know they were being compromised as early as 2001. Those “bug fix” firmware upgrades are intentionally vague.

I’m sure someone made some malware that can hijack Alexa. I’m very confident it happened already. It’s just extremely unlikely they have the only programmers who can make bugproof software. Amazon likely figured it out and patched them quietly. That’s the lifecycle of these things. In a few years someone will talk and people will pretend to be surprised.

And yes, I’ve got tape on my laptops camera. I don’t trust that either.",1527347269,dzm1s5p,t3_8m3yy6,t1_dzm1b7x,/r/homeautomation/comments/8m3yy6/let_this_be_a_lesson_after_gdpr_some_cloudbased/dzm1s5p/,0,homeautomation
ph0n3Ix,"I work in a parallel industry.  Trust me on this one, you want the Alexa experience you know today?  You need it to be internet connected.

&gt;Alexa works well because Amazon bought a ton of patents, and hired most of the voice/AI talent in the industry

Those engineers developed algorithms that they then patented.  You know what those algorithms need to work well?  Large data sets.  You know where you get large data sets?  From many small volume data sources.  You know what's really good at connecting many small volume data sources together?  The internet.

&gt;It could certainly work locally if Amazon wanted it to.

Again, no. Voice recognition is hard to do universally. With some effort, a reasonably powerful computer can be trained to work with a person's voice.  But this compute power is going to be higher than what ships with alexa, which means higher costs for consumers and higher power usage.  Not exactly consumer friendly.

I'd also like to point out that Apple tries to do as much as they possibly can ""off of the cloud"" for their users.  With *recent* \(read: not available when echo started shipping...\) advancements in compute power, we can do some offline processing of images.  But siri is still 100&amp;#37; cloud required.

&gt;There's a lot of data to be collected even if you limited the scope to improve the service

Yes.  This is my whole point.  You're going all tin\-foil\-hat on it, but that data that's collected is how many different people *sound*. This is what makes Alexa better at recognizing different accents, slurs, types of background noise...etc.  This is why you must sample as many diverse samples as possible; there is no way to get this breadth of training diversification locally.

&gt;We'll get to the point of local voice control.

Eventually, more of it will be something that can be done locally yes. But until then, there's plenty of weird pronunciations, slang and false\-positive triggers that need to be identified &amp; used to train against.  You're not going to accomplish that w/o an internet connection.

&gt;it's totally reasonable to keep 2 weeks of video logs.

Yes, just not at a consumer friendly price point.  Let's say you want 14 days, 24 hours of 1080 resolution \(which, let's be honest... is quaint.  a security camera that cant do 4k is going to look silly in 2 years; the professional ones already do, consumer wont be far behind!\). It's going to be \~ .04 gBytes per 60 seconds to store that 1080 res.  `.04gB * 60 * 24 * 14 = 806.4 gBytes`.  Yes, it's totally reasonable for a consumer camera to have 800 gigs of flash storage in it. I don't even need to check the prices on newegg to know that 800 gig is not going to cost the same as the 4 gig that is in my nest cam; it's all but given that the increased cost would be passed on to me.  Play with the numbers, if you'd like; to get that storage cost down, you're going to have to make very unacceptable compromises to frame rate, color, resolution, recording time...etc.

&gt;Nothing here is new. People have been doing this for decades \(that's what closed circuit is

You're kinda proving my point for me.  There's no way in hell you get the DVR abilities \+ storage in a local camera for a consumer.  These systems have always been designed with cheap cameras and a some form of remote connection to a big storage system.  You're just replacing coax with WiFI and local storage for cheaper remote storage and by doing so you get to tell the consumer that they'll be able to watch their camera remotely... which is the #1 feature people look for in them.  Internet connection on the camera is also inevitable.

I'm not even going to go into the complexities \(more hardware requirements / cost!\) of doing image recognition / classification \(so you dont get notified when a friendly face is seen on camera or when motion in a zone happens\) locally or what network difficulties you'll get from trying to store 2 weeks / 800 gig of video on a device and try to access that video from a remote device and share that video from the local device via the remote device.  Just trust me on this one, there's a lot of very good reasons why the camera are cheap and dumb and just stream what they have to a place where storage &amp; processing is much much faster/cheaper/easier.

TL;DR: You are the worst kind of right;  technically. You don't need an internet connection to do most things you expect an IoT Device to do.  It's just that it's going to be a terrible, expensive error prone, buggy / un\-updatable experience.  None of those words rank highly on the list of what consumers value when making an IoT device purchase.  If you're so concerned about what data amazon is collecting on you, stop connecting your echo to other services.  Stop using your credit card everywhere; that's a far more valuable/comprehensive profile of a person than anything you've asked alexa for.",1527346689,dzm1b7x,t3_8m3yy6,t1_dzljc2e,/r/homeautomation/comments/8m3yy6/let_this_be_a_lesson_after_gdpr_some_cloudbased/dzm1b7x/,2,homeautomation

pfs3w,"&gt; My husband and I are closing on our first home next month (yay!) and we know one of the first things to do is change the locks. A smartlock is very appealing but I'm having trouble deciding which one is best for us, because it seems the more I research the less certain I am. I also have a couple questions.

Ah, the perks of home ownership: feeling optimistic and creative, with a blank canvas in front of you. I envy you both!
Let me tell you why you should be considering the **August** Smart Lock brand of locks. I will post a small blurb on my contextual background and specific situation (which I posted elsewhere), then briefly mention the possible choices you have, and then respond to your list of requirements and setup,

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#PART I: CONTEXT

I am a renter; so obviously a lot of what I have to say may seem irrelevant. Seeing as I do not have a lot of creative control over the property, this would make smart locks tricky business. However, my landlord gave me permissions to replace the entire deadbolt, if I wanted. So, the first set of requirements were drafted as:

MUSTS:

- We have a dog that requires a dog walker to enter our house multiple times a week. The lock must allow this situation in as safe a manner as possible.

- We do not want to have to make copies of keys

- We do not want the dog walker (or any visitor) to HAVE TO download an app to get into the property

WANTS:

- Smart home integrate-able

- Reliable and well rated

- Cheap

- Connect to it remotely to lock/unlock and monitor

- Z-Wave compatible (came later, when I realized I wanted to have a smart home integration environment)

So, my research began, in earnest. It consumed me. Off the bat, the first names to pop up were August, Kwikset, Schlage and Yale.
Of those, three had keypad options, which became a requirement soon after. Despite the perks of the Kwikset Kevo (the touch to open), I removed it from the list.
Also, despite the fiance having an iPhone, I had an Android, so the lock had to have equal footing mobile phone ecosystem-independent. That removed things like Schlage Sense and other Homekit-only options.

The final list:

- August

- Yale YRD226 (A really good Yale lock choosing guide [here](https://www.yalehome.com/Yale/Yale%20US/Real%20Living/home%20control/selecting%20the%20right%20lock/Yale%20Real%20Living%20Lock%20Family_9-2015.pdf))

- Schlage Connect

I did a ton of cross referencing, reviews websites, pros and cons, etc etc. And CONSISTENTLY, the August locks were ranked #1/#2/#3. I won't go into too much more detail on what those websites and reviews indicated, I trust you guys can do that research.

But, in the end, the August locks were exactly what we needed, AND more. They were going to be the easiest to set up, and the best out of the gate. So we went with them, and haven't looked back since. My fiance, a ""smart-home-always-listening"" skeptic, casually told me yesterday how awesome she finds the smart lock.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

# PART II: THE LINEUP

So, what options to choose from?

- The August Smart Lock Pro ([August](http://august.com/products/august-smart-lock-wifi/) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Pro-generation/dp/B0765JNS2D/))

Pros: Most up to date, improved tech under the hood, **Z-Wave Plus** compatible, Door Sense, [most smart home integrations available](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51E2FcgIRQL._SL1000_.jpg), Auto lock/unlock

Cons: Most expensive

- The August Smart Lock 3rd Generation ([August](https://store.august.com/products/august-smart-lock-3rd-generation) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0752XNC8M/ref=s9_acsd_hps_bw_c_x_4_w))

Pros: Improved tech under the hood from the previous generation, Door Sense, Auto lock/unlock, traditional form factor, Cheaper

Cons: No useful smart home integrations (missing homekit, alexa/echo, google home, z wave)

To compare the above two, go here: http://august.com/keyless-entry/

- The August Smart Lock 2nd Generation ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-2nd-Generation/dp/B0168IXNZQ/))

Pros: Most cost effective ($125, but last week it was $109!) but still ranked #1 on MANY reputable websites ([CNET](https://www.cnet.com/topics/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices/best-smart-locks/) | [PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/article/344336/the-best-smart-locks) | etc), has built-in HomeKit capability, can be enhanced with additional devices

Cons: Least impressive underlying tech, no Door Sense capability, no effective smart home integrations

&amp;nbsp;

""Door Sense"": The ability to detect ""Door open"" / ""Door Closed"" situation.

&amp;nbsp;

**An Aside : Enhancement Products**

- The August Smart Keypad ([August](http://august.com/products/august-smart-keypad/)|[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/August-AK-R1-Smart-Keypad/dp/B015SLMR1U/))

This keypad adds in the functionality that you'd expect:

-- keyless code entry for guests (unlimited codes, managed via the app)

-- Lock it with a button press

-- Attachable for preferred outside entry

&amp;nbsp;

- The August Connect Wifi Bridge ([August](http://august.com/products/august-connect-wifi-bridge/)|[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/August-AC-R1-Connect-Wi-Fi-Bridge/dp/B0168IXNFQ))

This device enables you to link your otherwise-bluetooth-range-only smart lock to your wifi, effectively allowing you to connect and manage the smart lock from ANYWHERE that you have network connectivity. With it, you can:

-- Remotely lock/unlock your door

-- Receive alerts on any actions taken on your door remotely

-- have faster access to your lock as your app selects the best connection to use

&amp;nbsp;

#PART 2.5: BUNDLES/SALE

Consider price-watching for sales; I saw the 2nd gen for, like $109...
Personally, I jumped when the Smart Lock Pro + Wifi bridge bundle went on sale for $229 (same price as the lock itself), and the keypad was $55, on Amazon.

dnguyen800," Do you know if you have neutral wires throughout your house? Do you have large electrical boxes to fit the very large Leviton switches inside? Are you skilled enough in DIY electrical work that you won't make a mistake and burn down your house? Then maybe I would recommend Leviton, if you could purchase them at $30 or less.

I've installed Levitons in my friend's house, and a few Lutron dimmers in my roommate's house, and after both experiences, I would go with Lutron all the way. Despite adding an additional hub to your smart home solution, many people rave about the responsiveness and range of Lutron switches. Lutrons may seem more expensive, but you save so much time during installation that I think it's worth skipping the frustration and installation delays \(trust me, you will run into problems unless you're experienced\). And if you buy a Lutron dimmer, it comes with an extra pico remote, which you can then buy an additional Lutron wall plate and metal bracket for about $10\-15, and use that extra remote to replace a 3\-way switch. So the price is actually reasonable if you go for this method. The only downside is that you will have to replace the batteries in the remote eventually. I don't know about Homekit compatibility, but that is something you need to triple check since there isn't a Leviton WiFi/Z\-Wave/Homekit all\-in\-one switch.

My advice: don't be afraid about adding a new hub, especially when it is a good one like Lutron.

* \+ Lutron installation is a breeze\-\-smaller size and easy wiring
* \+ Lutron wallplates are much slicker than the rest
* \+ It works with Smartthings, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Home Assistant
* \- Pico remote batteries need to be replaced eventually
* \- Not everyone is a fan of the Lutron dimmer look
* \- I had an issue with Google Assistant not being able to turn on the light, but it could turn it off. Haven't had time to resolve.",1525217712,dyanmx7,t3_8g6fdz,t3_8g6fdz,/r/homeautomation/comments/8g6fdz/lutron_caseta_vs_leviton_decora/dyanmx7/,1,homeautomation

jemath,"You want a camera that you can access remotely but you dont want to use a 3rd party service because you ""don't trust anyones cloud.""

In order to do this, you will need to expose your network to the greater Internet. If you are planning on having better security than the third party providers, you must have a plan on how to secure your network and a maintenance plan on how to keep it secure and up to date. You probably will want to regularly monitor your access logs because there will almost certainly be people or scripts probing your network for vulnerabilities. Youre probably on the US-CERT mailing list or something similar in order to make sure you alerted of any security news.

Security is a full time job. Unless you're an IT pro, you're almost certainly safer to use a third party service than to open your network up to the internet.

RebelTBU,"This is such a painfully bad take that I can't resist responding to it. 

Your statement makes the assumptions that these companies give even a tiny damn about the security of their end users, which has been proven time and time again to be not just incorrect, but also quite the opposite -- the number of clearly intentional backdoor exploits in many of these devices is mindblowing. For God's sake, there are still large manufacturers that advise basic port forwarding as an acceptable method for transmission outside of a home network.

Furthermore, ANY device that connects (especially one that REQUIRES a cloud connection) to the cloud and doesn't have very robust hardening and authentication standards is inherently less secure due to there being such a substantially larger attack surface. 

All of that to say, some manufacturers are absolutely trustworthy and have proven that over time. Others have been proven exactly the opposite and could even be considered malicious actors. But suggesting that OP should just trust a big company to do the right thing is the very definition of foolhardy.

theinsanemadman,"&gt; I don't trust any 'out of the box' solutions, due to the ease in which someone can access the network/camera and view her apartment at their leisure.

An answer in layman-y manner: anything that you could setup with your knowledge set (e.g. not knowing WAN vs LAN) would be much less secure than an out-of-the-box solution for you, due to the potential to misconfigure various security measures.

Things like 'Blink' or 'Ring' are no less secure than any other camera monitoring solution with the ease of use you are looking for. Custom solutions that would involve designing and programming a new iPhone app  are far out of range, and debatable in their own security.

I highly recommend doing some research on the out of the box solutions suggested in other posts here.

Schnort,"&gt; You've linked to a graph of ipod sales as a %age of Apple's total revenue. What does that prove?

That you can't read charts.   There's two numbers on that chart.   %revenue, and # unit sales in millions.

&gt; In 2002, Apple had 33% of the hard drive music player market with 4th quarter sales of 140,000 iPods. A year later, it had 64% of that market selling 304,000. Apple more than doubled its sales, while the rest of the market failed to grow at all.

hard drives were a tiny tiny portion of the market.

trust me on this.   We were selling 10s of millions of units per quarter back in 2003/2004.

The original HD market was the RIO product, then the iPod and a few knockoffs and they didn't sell much.   Large percentages of not much is still not much.

They were pretty much the only two HD products available that were worth anything and sold anything.

In 2004/2005, we shipped our 100th million part into the flash market...

The real volume was in flash players.  Even with Apple.

A thousand room hotel is a much more lucrative target for remote hackers than any single house. They know exactly where it is and compromising it give access to hundreds of devices.

I have had 2 2nd gen nests for years that have always worked perfectly for me and done everything I wanted but if I did it again, I’d go ecobee for sure. Nest is too closed down in their own ecosystem and doesn’t really work with anything outside of it hardly. 

For lights, I’d get inovelli switches for the majority of switches. Their customer service is exceptional and their product seems just as well built as anyone else I’ve compared them to in person. They also don’t require an add on switch in 3/4 way setups. They are more than willing to answer any questions via email and their founder even is an active presence on reddit. u/InovelliUSA

I use GE for my ceiling fan controls. 

And as said already I’d get smartthings. I think it’s the best starting point for anyone as it allows it to be as simplified or it can be more complex writing your own code and customize smartapps and device handlers. I haven’t even gotten into webCoRe yet but I see that it should open up a multitude of possibilities too. 

I also prefer Alexa over google home. Comparing dots to minis, sure google has a better/louder speaker and you can ask google more random questions and get an answer more often but Alexa has more smart home integration by far, has more 3rd party support in pretty much everything and I trust amazon with my private data more than I do google. I mean, google’s whole existence began with compiling data and keeping track of information. People are as much their product as anything they make is. 

Edit: I do have a multitude of door sensors and a couple of motion sensors. If you want z-wave, Inovelli is the best for the best price I’ve seen that still has temperature built in. It’s probably the highest quality contact sensor I have. 

The rest are zigbee. The cheapest is visonic that you can buy on sale for $10 pretty regularly but I wouldn’t buy them for their normal prices $15/$20. I’d buy the iris ones from Lowe’s for $20. They use a cr2 instead of a button battery and I have cr2 on hand all the time anyway. 

I also have pretty much one of every xiaomi sensor but they aren’t really plug and play as they require a bit of finagling and need a custom device handler to function with smartthings.

&gt;Two hours laters, my house was filled with smoke and none of the alarms chirped. 
&gt;Luckily, this was during the day when I was not home. Terrible smoke detector!




And I'll repeat, my Nest Protect sounded when a match was lit under it.

I could care less about the false alarms, all I know is that Nest Protect is super sensitive, and that's what I love. I'll be sure to vacuum my house to ensure that dust will never be an issue and that we don't necessarily have an issue with bugs on our ceiling. If our Nest Protect went off for a false alarm, I'll at least know that it'll need to get replaced soon, so that my house will always sound, in any chance there's a fire.

Unlike yours, that review for the FireX is quite horrid, and that you would rather trust your LIFE with that instead. :ok_hand:",1521158132,dvrox2n,t3_84nwrm,t1_dvroivr,/r/homeautomation/comments/84nwrm/nest_launches_39_temperature_sensor/dvrox2n/,0,homeautomation
adanufgail,"&gt;entirely a user error

No, numerous users reported that it would just go off as a false alarm. That in itself is unacceptable, and the fact that once this happened it was sometimes impossible to shut them off, leaving one guy to double bagging them and submerging them in a cooler of water to muffle the noise.

It doesn't matter if these were old products. Nest sold a product that, if malfunctioning, could lead to countless deaths (for instance if an apartment building catches fire and spreads because nobody's smoke detector went off). That loss of trust isn't won back by a firmware upgrade or model revision. 

EDIT: Nest still acknowledges there might be false alarms:

InovelliUSA,"Good evening Wes,

Awesome, thanks for reaching out! I saw the Amazon review and actually was just about to reach out to you (well, at least I'm assuming this is you -- if it's not, my bad) to try to figure this out. As you can imagine, it's tough to diagnose an issue as there's lots of variables in play, but please trust me when I tell you we'll get you up and running one way or another. 

I think what would be easiest to do is for me to do is explain how the switches should work and then you can let me know if that's what you're seeing.

The dimmer switches, when pressed, should dim on (it takes about 1-2 seconds for it to dim up and down). This is the default timing, but you're right, this can be edited in SmartThings via the parameters we installed on our switches which control the ramp rate. If you want an instantaneous dim, simply input any number between 1 and 99 (the higher the faster) and that will change it.

What I have noticed on our dimmers and is being addressed is that some of the paddles seem to need excessive force for them to work. While still in the margin of error for defect rate, it seems to be a consistent issue, so we're luckily able to address it. This could possibly be what's happening here as you mention it was not registering properly. Is this happening on all three of your switches? If so, that's extremely rare, but obviously not out of the question.

Ok, now to tackle the individual switches:

- On the first dimmer, was this a 3-Way setting or a single pole setting?

- The second one honestly sounds like a paddle issue -- would you mind pressing firmly in the middle of the top and bottom part of the switch? If it works then, I believe it's a paddle issue and I will definitely swap it out

- Have you tried the third switch yet (I'm assuming no as we went 0 for 2 -- sorry)

Anyway, let me know the answers to the questions above and please know that I'm extremely sorry for the frustration. If we can't get these to work, I will personally test dimmer switches and send them to you as I do stand behind my products and enjoy hearing the positive experiences people have. It's equally as frustrating to me (more heartbreaking, but frustrating too) when I know our product has caused issues because I've been there too and it's not fun.

I'll look forward to hearing from you and have a great night!

Eric

phyraks,"So, I started with 1 Nest Protect because I got it on sale.  I wanted to expand the system, but started thinking exactly what you are... it's expensive... so I bought a Leeo on sale and then I got annoyed with my alarms chirping without warning, so I bought some Roost batteries... haha...

Basically, I've played with all 3 pretty extensively at this point.

I like and trust the Nest Protects the most, but Leeo and Roost are ok alternatives... I just don't know that they are super reliable to be honest...

I ended up putting a Nest Protect in the main areas of each floor.  A short while ago, I had two separate incidents where I had smoke in my kitchen and the Nest Protect nearby went off, but the Leeo did not give me any notification... it's possible the Nest Protect uses a non-standard frequency for the siren, so the Leeo didn't know how to handle it, but it sounds like any other smoke alarm siren to me.

Based on the fact that the Leeo never did anything, I'm not inclined to trust it...

Sure not everyone actually needs one. My point is that if you are on the fence at all get one. They are extremely useful and easily the best purchase I have ever made. Yeah, I actually still have to clean vs just paying someone to do it but it takes what would have been a several hour job and now I can clear up in less than 45 minutes. It's way less money(&lt;$300 vs $120/week), more secure and less of a headache and best of all it's done every day. I don't have to trust someone with keys or a code to my house. My opinion is that everyone should have one, yours isn't we are allowed to have differing opinions. 

As for three floors. You can move one between floors and it will work just fine. Skewing the argument with the suggestion that you actually need more than one to fit your opinion is disingenuous at best. Still doesn't even work out in your favor because it is still cheaper when you consider the how quickly the cost of a cleaning service stacks up. 

&gt;don't speak in generalities (especially saying things like ""Talking about what looked like a 14 year old covered in pot leaf tattoos screaming at another girl that looked like shit might have had some meth in the past"", 

I mean I guess if you enjoy having that scene take place in front of you as a customer of this cleaning service more power to you. I'd rather not. I am also perfectly allowed to judge people on their looks and behavior when they are in my home. 

&gt; Automation is about making your life easier, not automating for the sake of automating. In my case it was far more useful to design a lighting scheme that followed the cleaner around the house with beacons, adjusting lighting to optimal color temps and brightness wherever they were, turning off lights in rooms they weren't, and allowing flexible access to the house and alarm system without physical keys and codes (along with some other things).

That assessment is so ass backwards. Which is more of a headache? A robo vac set to clean at 9:00am ever day. or designing a lighting that follows a beacon around your house adjusting lights for your cleaner? Seriously. That is automating to automate if I ever did hear it. You could have just let the cleaner flips lights on and off instead you force her to have a beacon on her...

WyzeCam,"We have no plans for a mandatory subscription service at this point but I understand if you take my words with a (massive) grain of salt. We may put in an OPTIONAL subscription at some point for improved Cloud storage but we would not remove features.

You have to set up the Wyze Cam when connected to the internet but you can turn off the cloud pretty easily by turning off motion and sound detection. Please note that you WILL NOT receive notifications anymore because those are generated by the AWS Cloud when videos are uploaded. However, with a microSD card you could have continuous recording (record on event won't work without detection settings turned on), use the live stream, and use the time lapse features. If you have a v2, you would still be able to see the motion tagging in Playback and on your live stream.

Shutting down isn't on the radar at this point but I can't see the future. Happily, if we DO go down, there is a way to turn this camera into a Xiaomi camera if needed or you could use local storage to create a multipurpose $20 paperweight.

Then I use my smarthome stuff as a backup by triggering my cameras and push notifications to my phone for other things.  There's not a diy or off the shelf system that I personally trust.  Like I know people using smartthings with their paid monitoring.  Just too many bugs IMHO to trust that not to have tons of false alarms.

This way I get the best of both worlds.  It's not the cheapest route for sure.  My home came with the alarm already here but still it would only be like 500 ish for what I have.  Then yes I do have multiple sensors on my doors since I have 2 systems.  Doesnt bother me.  

Now if I was in a small apartment or rental, I might consider a diy setup without any paid monitoring.  But at that point its just 'informational' than an alarm system.  To each their own.

So HA is not noticing when the door opens/shuts. It's maddening because I'd like to alert on the door state, but can't trust it.

There are errors in my OZW logs about dropped messages, but nothing I can do about them.

Mamoulian,"I believe EvoHome handles this, the controller knows which TRVs are open/closed and which are about to open/close and does 'the right thing' with the boiler. There's a max cycles per hour count to prevent switching the boiler too often. As a major heating component supplier for many years I hope I can trust them!

I'm happy to have paid £187 for a solid, reliable, tested controller from a well-known major manufacturer with lots of experience building boiler controllers. We rarely touch the controller's touchscreen, the app is good and we've set up some complex scheduling to fit around us. Any deviations are actioned by Google Home via IFTTT or Amazon Dash buttons via HomeAssistant.

Your sticking point is going to be the 12 zones. Note that multiple radiators in one room count as one zone. Might be worth emailling their support to see if they're planning on increasing the count (it's just software, right? :-) and to let you know when they do.

It doesn't need the internet unless you want to use the mobile app/web page/IFTTT/Google Home/HomeAssistant's default component* to interact with it. You can set up all the schedules on the controller touchscreen and leave it to it, or pop back to the controller whenever you want to make a change. The TRVs also have (electronic) turny knobs so you can override their local temp without visiting the controller.

First, I consider it a pretty fundamental feature of these devices to be able to operate outside my network (ie when I'm away from home). So, that would never be a possibility in my view. 

Second, sure, at least from a NETWORK security perspective, it would be secure -- as I said, I'd never connect it to the internet. But, that doesn't mean I would trust the security of my home to it either. That's actually one of the things that baffles me the most about a large segment of the home automation crowd -- the almost fanatical devotion to being as cheap as possible. I'm not saying that everything has to be a Savant or Crestron-level product, but I would never put some of the cheap, flimsy 120vac stuff that people use in my home. Similarly, I would never put a hikvision product in position to be a point of failure that could allow entry to my home. And that's not just hikvision...I put Ring in the same category. And others, for the record. 

Third, I would add that there are other non-cloud based options out there that aren't a security disaster. I don't love the skybell product but it's at least reasonably secure. Doorbird seems OK if glitchy. The Axis one I mentioned above is the best device in that entire market by a lot. They may cost more money, but I'm crossing a lot of things off of the ""I wonder..."" list by going that route.

Darkenny,"It sounds like your Skybell project is on hold now, but since I'm running into the same kind of problem I thought I'd see if I could share what I've learned.

According to the picture of your speaker inside view, it looks like the door chime has the transformer built into it.  It looks like you probably have this one: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Prime-Chime-Wired-In-Wall-Door-Bell-Kit-18888/205506791 (which does say the transformer is built-in).  I can't tell if it's mechanical or digital, but it does say it only works with Prime Chime bell buttons only.

If it is digital, I don't think the Skybell is going to work with that since you need access to the transformer to wire the adapter in between it and the door chime.  Maybe there's a way to open it, but it doesn't look like it.  If you find it isn't going to work, and still want to install the Skybell I'd suggest finding a mechanical door chime that doesn't require the digital adapter.  I don't trust that thing.

I'm having my own issues with the Skybell, in the same situation as you.  Bought one while I was building my house.  It just got done 2 weeks ago, and the electrician installed they Skybell but without the adapter... so it wasn't getting enough power.   So I installed the digital adapter, and still was getting constant ""not enough power"" errors from the Skybell.  I contacted their support and they said I needed a stronger transformer since I had a digital chime, and they suggested a 24v.  I bought one, installed it last night and it worked for about 2 hours.  Then the damn adapter burned up and could have caught on fire had I not smelled it burning and run over and yanked the chime/adapter off the wall.  I don't want to imagine what would have happened had I not been home.

I'm going to look for a cheap mechanical door chime next, and figure I'll just be out the $50 for the digital door chime, $12 for the other transformer, and $12 for the digital adapter.  :(",1516834304,dt6vi0j,t3_7fj0zp,t3_7fj0zp,/r/homeautomation/comments/7fj0zp/q_how_to_tell_if_i_have_a_wireless_doorbell_or/dt6vi0j/,2,homeautomation

WalksByNight,"Electric strikes are pretty much generic, so you can buy one from any reputable manufacturer and be good to go. The cost is in the control systems. Also, custom options add up very quickly. The hidden key niche you describe— I don’t know of an off the shelf set up for this— you could certainly have a contractor build one with some metal parts and with decent woodworking skills, but that’s not cheap either. Most door strikes permit override with a master key lock, so that’s not an issue.  


For control, there are lots of very reliable commercial access systems which permit remote unlock, guest RF cards, and all sorts of status alerts. RF readers can be concealed or small enough to be discreet or tasteful. I suggest you find a local installer you can establish some trust with, and have them suggest a specific system based on needs and cost— some of that will include running wires for the strike and control. The new access systems use Cat5e or 6 run from a central controller unit tied into LAN, to a local touchpad or keypad control inside the door, which controls the doorstrike.

MisterWil,"Last week I also attempted to follow the directions to install a Zooz switch and the first time nothing worked. I’m not super familiar with three-way switches so I ended up having to use a multimeter and map the wires from both switches manually.

In my case I had one switch (A) with a white wire, a black wire, and a red wire. At the second switch (B) I had two black wires and a red wire. Both had grounds. Both boxes also had a collection of white-wire neutrals in a wire nut at the back of the box.

I took pictures of my existing switches and then unhooked them entirely, separating the wires. I turned the power back on and after testing all wires to ground I found that on switch A the white wire was the hot (line) wire from the box. No other wires had any load on them.

I then turned the power back off and then wire-nutted the black and red wires together at switch A. At switch B I could then do a continuity test and found the two matching black and red wires at switch B. I separated the wires again.

This left me with a single black wire at switch B, which had to be my load wire back to the lights. This would mean I would need to follow “Option 2” in the Zooz wiring diagram. I confirmed this by wire-nutting the two black wires at switch B together, and then I turned the power on and then very carefully touched my switch A white (line) wire to the black wire. The lights turned on. Success!

So, at the end of the day, at switch A, I ended up wrapping my white wire with some electrical tape so future-me or future-owner would know that this is the line wire and hooked it up to LINE on the switch. I hooked the black wire up to the LOAD on the switch. The red wire I hooked up to the TRAVELER on the switch. NEUTRAL to the neutral bundle in the box.

RichardBLine,"Zigbee occupies the same 2.4 ghz spectrum as Wi-Fi.  This is the reason why the Philips Hue bridge has the feature to change the channel on the bridge.  You can read the information in this link if you want to read how ZigBee and Wi-Fi channels overlap: https://support.metageek.com/hc/en-us/articles/203845040-ZigBee-and-WiFi-Coexistence . If you want out of the 2.4 ghz space completely, go Zwave.

Next, in 2016, there as security issue in the Philips product, that could have been exploited by hackers.  You can read it about it here: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/10/iot_worm_can_hack_philips_hue_lightbulbs_spread_across_cities/

Zwave products are not immune to security issues either.  Again, in 2016, there were a few hacking tools that were released to show how insecure a lot of Zwave products were: https://www.csoonline.com/article/3024217/security/ez-wave-z-wave-hacking-tool-capable-of-breaking-bulbs-and-abusing-z-wave-devices.html .

What people need t realize is that these protocols are not inherently insecure.  It's the implementation of the protocols that can be insecure.  When there are security problems in Wi-Fi, you tend to hear about it since Wi-Fi is the predominant wireless protocol.  When there are similar issues in other protocols, you hardly here about them, which makes you think that they are more secure, but it's not true.

The two links above are just two that I have in my notes are security issues in Zigbee and ZWave.  There are so much more that the average user just doesn't here about.  When there are security issues in these devices, you just have to trust that the manufactures will output a fix as soon as possible.  Which means, when you have to choose products from reputable companies instead of choosing the cheapest ones available.

crazyhorse90210,Ok so I got this lock as well and by far the best security upgrade of it is that it locks itself after 30 seconds or so again. My kids and wife always left the door unlocked when I wasn’t home and now that never happens. Second upgrade is we have no keys any more and every person in my family has their own code. I don’t even know the kids’ codes just my own. I have a log of every single unlock and entry and an alert on my phone every single time my lock opens and who opened it. I can be in the garage and have the door locked and my 8 year old comes home and I can tell he’s home because he unlocked the door and I get an alert. The door locks again on its own. Old behavior I had to leave the door open when I was back in the garage or lock it and hope I heard him come home or stay in the house. Now kids are never standing outside ringing the doorbell. Of course the code could be compromised but we can change it for anyone much easier than rekeying for all ‘users’. We can change one code any time. I can grant access at any time remotely with a one time code or just open the lock or disable all codes from around the country. It’s all done on my phone with secured zwave. When my wife gets home I set the lock to unlock with proximity. She loves that. I had my doubts but I love this thing and it has changed how I am always checking if the door is locked. At night I don’t even do my ‘rounds’ any more. I don’t totally trust the Bluetooth locks but the zwave locks are harder to hack and if someone misplaces their phone I just disable the proximity action.  Sorry for being long winded I’m on painkillers for a ruptured disc.  Oh yeah the other thing is the tamper alarm makes it beep and time it opens and closes or someone knocks. I like that it’s like an alarm system audible beep. Super useful. I’m in love with my lock. My wife has welcomed it into our marriage as well.

kaizendojo,"It's difficult as every home and its occupants are different.  My setup wouldn't suit you as I live alone and set the house up for my needs and I use a lot of different platforms and then tie them all together with an open source program called Home Assistant.

But if you are looking for a platform that is:
1. Easily installed and maintained without being a tech genius
2. Supports a large base of different home automation devices and platforms
3. Is easy to start with and then expand
4. Can be picked up at a local Home Depot or Best Buy
5. Has decent support techs and a large enough base of users that you can find support online

Might I suggest seriously considering Wink?

I actually started off with Wink.  I expanded on it and later when I started using Home Assistant, I was able to integrate my Wink hub and devices into the program and really start to make use of my whole house.

Also, Wink is supported with both Alexa and Google Assistant.  It acts as a hub for all of your physical devices and cloud accounts (for instance, if you bought some Philips Hue bulbs) and gives you a control app that unifies all your supported devices and gives you some rudimentary automating abilities.

From your description and use case, you are kinda the customer Wink was designed for.  It would be a great way for you to start and best of all, you can keep using the investment once you start to outgrow Wink alone and want to start to integrate it into a larger system.

If you're worried that you might not get an unbiased opinion from a home automation specialist... Pro Tip: you're right.  Most are  going to sell you whatever they rep or has the best sales incentives that month.  And it's likely to be overkill to what you need.  The thing is if it's overkill and intimidating, you might be less likely to get into learning about it and that's half the fun.

Better to find an electrician you trust and then if you want to add anything in that is hard wired like a switch or outlet, get the specs printed out and go over it with him to make sure it is compatible or doesn't require any special rewiring (most smart outlets and switches that are hard wired require power for the radios so they usually require a neutral wire).

dopo,"I've had problems accessing the cloud, not as much as him, but plenty of times.

The local recording presumably works for me (only verified once), but every few months either my Arlo Q Plus or my Pro base station decide that the SD card isn't inserted, or isn't formatted, and I have to reformat them.  So I don't much trust that backup storage in the event I were to actually need it.

As far as these being useful as ""security cameras"", there are two stupid shortcomings that make them a joke:
- There is a cooling off period between motion triggered recordings, during which the cameras refuse to record.  If there is motion caused recording, then a pause in motion that ends the recording, there will be a period of time after that in which the cameras will not record on any more motion.  It seems to be roughly equal to the duration of the prior recording.
- If you view the live stream, the system stops recording the video.  So you get a motion notification, and want to see what is going on, you can't view the live stream without losing the video evidence of whatever might be happening.  Alternatively, you're stuck waiting for the very tense period until the motion recording finishes  and becomes available to view.

The mobile app is severely lacking in features to let you rapidly review events, compared to competitors like Ring and Kuna.  I want the notification pop up to show a still image of a significant frame of the video.  I want the option to take 2 seconds reviewing a recording in fast-forward to see if it's something important, rather than click, wait a few seconds, then watch in real time.

We're driven by privacy and security, and by wanting to occupy this space in the market. 

We're the open source voice assistant that cares about your privacy, not the one who wants to use what you say to sell you more stuff.

I did some battery testing, and at a dead short, the Energizers gave 3x the amps over the Duracell Procells. Pay the extra $0.25 and go with Energizers.

If you're only interested in bulbs, then you can probably get them grouped the way you want and either use their app or a couple of IFTTT recipes (which TP-Link doesn't support) to add intelligence.  But even then, I think you have to stick with the same brand of bulb unless you want to have duplicate IFTTT recipes (becoming cumbersome to program) that fire different outcomes on the same trigger.  In addition to allowing you to add wall switches or outlets (for places where you can't or it's difficult to just replace the bulb, or where you don't want to _have_ to use your phone/Alexa to control) the hub should allow you to use bulbs from different manufacturers (Sengled, Cree, Sylvania, etc.) that speak the same common language.
