fastlerner,"I get what you're saying about the expectation of privacy in a front yard that faces the street, but I don't think it's as black and white as it seems.

I've gone back and looked at older ring videos and noticed that I can hear my TV quietly in the background of recordings of the neighbors cat crossing my porch, and my living room is on the other side of my kitchen from the front door.

This tells me that it's very likely that the camera could pick up a loud conversation in my kitchen, which is definitely somewhere I would expect to have some privacy.  And it could definitely record me having a conversation with a friend which was quiet enough that I would not expect a neighbor to hear (much less a police officer sitting in an office miles away) as we entered or exited the door or sat on the porch with a large front yard between us and the street.

It's for this reason that I don't share my footage.  Sooner or later though, it's likely to bite some unsuspecting person who does.

If Ring would just open up the ability to access the camera feed locally, I'd turn off everything cloud related except doorbell notifications.",1574279821,f85otox,t3_dz3d1m,t1_f851k1j,/r/smarthome/comments/dz3d1m/amazon_confirms_police_can_keep_ring_doorbell/f85otox/,1,smarthome

You're in the awkward situation where you've bought the things you need to control before deciding on what's going to control them. This is like buying tires and then looking for a car that can use them. You might not end up with what really works best for you this way.

I don't think many manufactures will take that leap and hand over control of their devices to Google. There is too much privacy concerns with Google knowing too much in many peoples minds. 

Google is a company of great ideas. Sometimes they are good, sometimes not. Sometimes they actually see the light of day, sometimes not. Sometimes the implementation is poor, sometimes not.

magicfab,"I am in the same boat. I've decided to focus on Free open source software solutions and standards-based devices, with an emphasis on privacy. Our first few weeks have been exploring the hardware available, then focusing on Zigbee / Zwave devices and the big brands (Hue, Lutron, etc.). I am also exploring voice control, trying to avoid Alexa, Google and Apple while doing everything on LAN ie. without depending on Cloud and in general, the Internet - except for initial configuration and updates.

After a few weeks experimenting with different solutions, our focus is on OpenHAB while keeping an eye on [Mozilla's WebThings Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway/) project which has a lot of activity and improves by the day.

IMO having a demo ready is important. OpenHAB does a great job on that.

I've found the least path of resistance is approaching existing alarm companies (they know cabling, have customers, are always looking to compete with others), and residential/commercial construction and renovation businesses. You may also want to decide who will be your customers, perhaps not deal with home/business property owners directly.

I' ve been asked to make a hardware prototype of such a free open source-based solution so that's what we're doing. So far that means an rPi + Zwave/zigbee USB stick, high endurance CD and some devices to show. We' re considering another higher-end device (mini PC + SSD), and testing both approaches. Having a cheap rPI + SD card seems to be more efefctive even keeping in minf SD replacements every once in a while.

What geographic area are you in ? Maybe we can exchange more information, experience and + as we go on.

Stratotally,"Sure, things should be voice controlled, or be on an app on your phone. I get that.

However: 

* Tablets can cost less than a monitor/computer setup mounted on a wall.
* Theres a built in camera, so it can turn on when motion is detected. OR use it as a clock, display photos, etc.
* You don't have to bolt it to the wall, you could have a detachable mount or use magnets.
* Bit of a stretch, but it also has a built-in battery if the power goes out. If you run your hub / wifi on an UPS like I do, it can help control/monitor some gadgets that are battery powered.

ShowMeTheMonee,"Hi, 

Can you say more about what you actually want to achieve from home automation and a smart home? You mention security and the roborock - are you also thinking about heating? Lighting? controlling appliances? 

How do you want to control the appliances? With voice? with physical switches? with tablets or a remote to control scenes? 

Are you an apple household? Android? Amazon? indifferent? 

Would you prefer a solution which is all set up, or would you like to be able to customise it yourself? Are you ok with some programming or you want to avoid that? 

Given that home automation can sometimes have some strange behaviours, it might be recommended to keep your home security separate from your home automation system. 

Many people use some kind of z-wave hub (smartthings, homekit, vera etc) plus different modules to control different activities.

swoopy_puppy,"If you value your safety, stay away from cheap leds, I once bought a package of cheap Chinese mr16 led bulbs that were 10 times cheaper than Phillips branded ones. Luckily I installed them in my office where there is no carpet.

The first one went out with some fizzy noise about a month after installing it. Second and third ones died one week later about two days apart, but the fourth one died next weekend with a very loud bang and flash, lots of sparks and smoke, that alone could have started a fire very easily had it been near a curtain, shelf or sofa.

kigmatzomat,"Join the homeseer forum. Lots of useful things there. Links to videos and the like.

The main thing is learning the event system. The UI is fairly straightforward but the notion of events re inherently complicated.

It uses an If (a becomes b and c becomes d) or (e becomes f and g becomes h) then set device I to status J.

It's all managed by dropdown menus so its fast...once you get used to thinking through your needs. 

There are times you will want to add a counter and a timer so you can set up an event after 3 things happen in 15 minutes. It's not hard to add timers or counters, it's hard to get the logic right.

Just start small. Make a few scenarios and run them for a week. Then add a bit more as you figure out what you forgot.

I will say with a thermostat you should be sure to define summer, winter and that comfortable window where no hvac is needed. 

Don't run your heat set point up against your cool set point. Most hvac systems overrun the target temp and have 2-3F of swing around their target temp.

Add some kind of override that if the temp ever goes over 85 that heat turns off or if the temp is below 60 that the AC turns off.
