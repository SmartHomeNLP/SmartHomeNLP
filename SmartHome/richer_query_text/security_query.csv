But regarding some  business-critical applications, the organizations, especially large  enterprises, still wouldn’t move them to cloud. The market size  the cloud computing shared is still far behind the one expected.  From the consumers’ perspective, cloud computing security  concerns, especially data security and privacy protection issues,  remain the primary inhibitor for adoption of cloud computing  services. This paper provides a concise but all-round analysis on  data security and privacy protection issues associated with cloud  computing across all stages of data life cycle. Then this paper  discusses some current solutions. Finally, this paper describes  future research work about data security and privacy protection  issues in cloud.  Keywords-access control; cloud computing; cloud computing  security; data segregation; data security; privacy protection.  I. INTRODUCTION  From initial concept building to current actual deployment,  cloud computing is growing more and more mature. Nowadays  many organizations, especially Small and Medium Business  (SMB) enterprises, are increasingly realizing the benefits by  putting their applications and data into the cloud. The adoption  of cloud computing may lead to gains in efficiency and  effectiveness in developing and deployment and save the cost  in purchasing and maintaining the infrastructure.   Regarding definition of cloud computing model, the most  widely used one is made by NIST as “Cloud computing is a  model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a  shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,  networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can  be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management  effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model  promotes availability and is composed of five essential  characteristics, three service models, and four deployment  models.”[1] The cloud computing model NIST defined has  three service models and four deployment models. The three  service models, also called SPI model, are: Cloud Software as a  Service (SaaS), Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Cloud  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The four deployment models  are: Private cloud, Community cloud, Public cloud and Hybrid  cloud.  Compared with the traditional IT model, the cloud  computing has many potential advantages. But from the  consumers’ perspective, cloud computing security concerns  remain a major barrier for the adoption of cloud computing.  According to a survey from IDCI in 2009, 74% IT managers  and CIOs believed that the primary challenge that hinders them  from using cloud computing services is cloud computing  security issues [2]. Another survey carried out by Garter in  2009, more than 70% CTOs believed that the primary reason  not to use cloud computing services is that there are data  security and privacy concerns.  Although cloud computing service providers touted the  security and reliability of their services, actual deployment of  cloud computing services is not as safe and reliable as they  claim. In 2009, the major cloud computing vendors  successively appeared several accidents. Amazon's Simple  Storage Service was interrupted twice in February and July  2009. This accident resulted in some network sites relying on a  single type of storage service were forced to a standstill. In  March 2009, security vulnerabilities in Google Docs even led  to serious leakage of user private information. Google Gmail  also appeared a global failure up to 4 hours. It was exposed that  there was serious security vulnerability in VMware  virtualization software for Mac version in May 2009. People  with ulterior motives can take advantage of the vulnerability in  the Windows virtual machine on the host Mac to execute  malicious code. Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform  also took place a serious outage accident for about 22 hours.  Serious security incidents even lead to collapse of cloud  computing vendors. As administrators’ misuse leading to loss  of 45% user data, cloud storage vendor LinkUp had been  forced to close.  Security control measures in cloud are similar to ones in  traditional IT environment. As multi-tenant characteristic,  service delivery models and deploy models of cloud computing,  2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Electronics Engineering 978-0-7695-4647-6/12 $26.00 © 2012 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICCSEE.2012.193 647 Authorized licensed use limited to: Aarhus University.

Traditional security issues are still present in cloud  computing environments. But as enterprise boundaries have  been extended to the cloud, traditional security mechanisms are  no longer suitable for applications and data in cloud. Due to the  openness and multi-tenant characteristic of the cloud, cloud  computing is bringing tremendous impact on information  security field:  (1) Due to dynamic scalability, service abstraction, and  location transparency features of cloud computing models, all  kinds of applications and data on the cloud platform have no  fixed infrastructure and security boundaries. In the event of  security breach, it’s difficult to isolate a particular physical  resource that has a threat or has been compromised.  (2) According to the service delivery models of cloud  computing, resources cloud services based on may be owned  by multiple providers. As there is a conflict of interest, it is  difficult to deploy a unified security measures;  (3) As the openness of cloud and sharing virtualized  resources by multi-tenant, user data may be accessed by other  unauthorized users.  (4) As the cloud platform has to deal with massive  information storage and to deliver a fast access, cloud security  measures have to meet the need of massive information  processing.  This paper describes data security and privacy protection  issues in cloud. This paper is organized as follows: Section II  gives a brief description of what exactly cloud computing  security-related issues are. Section III discusses data security  and privacy protection issues associated with cloud computing  across all stages of data life cycle. Section IV shows current  solutions for data security and privacy protection issues in  cloud. Section V summarizes the contents of this paper. Section  VI describes future research work.  II. CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY ISSUSES  A. Cloud Computing Security  Wikipedia [3] defines Cloud Computing Security as “Cloud  computing security (sometimes referred to simply as ""cloud  security"") is an evolving sub-domain of computer security,  network security, and, more broadly, information security. It  refers to a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls  deployed to protect data, applications, and the associated  infrastructure of cloud computing.” Note that cloud computing  security referred to here is not cloud-based security software  products such as cloud-based anti-virus, anti-spam, anti-DDoS,  and so on.  B. Security Issues Associated with the Cloud  There are many security issues associated with cloud  computing and they can be grouped into any number of  dimensions.  According to Gartner [4], before making a choice of cloud  vendors, users should ask the vendors for seven specific safety  issues: Privileged user access, regulatory compliance, data  location, data segregation, recovery, investigative support and  long-term viability. In 2009, Forrester Research Inc. [5]  evaluated security and privacy practices of some of the leading  cloud providers (such as Salesforce.com, Amazon, Google, and  Microsoft) in three major aspects: Security and privacy,  compliance, and legal and contractual issues. Cloud Security  Alliance (CSA) [6] is gathering solution providers, non-profits  and individuals to enter into discussion about the current and  future best practices for information assurance in the cloud.  The CSA has identified thirteen domains of concerns on cloud  computing security [7].  S. Subashini and V. Kavitha made an investigation of cloud  computing security issues from the cloud computing service  delivery models (SPI model) and give a detailed analysis and  assessment method description for each security issue [8].  Mohamed Al Morsy, John Grundy and Ingo Müller explored  the cloud computing security issues from different perspectives,  including security issues associated with cloud computing  architecture, service delivery models, cloud characteristics and  cloud stakeholders [9]. Yanpei Chen, Vern Paxson and Randy  H. Katz believed that two aspects are to some degree new and  essential to cloud: the complexities of multi-party trust  considerations, and the ensuing need for mutual auditability.  They also point out some new opportunities in cloud  computing security [10].  According to the SPI service delivery models, deployment  models and essential characteristics of cloud, there are security  issues in all aspects of the infrastructure including network  level, host level and application level.     Figure 1.  Cloud computing security architecture  III. DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION ISSUES  The content of data security and privacy protection in cloud  is similar to that of traditional data security and privacy  protection. It is also involved in every stage of the data life  cycle. But because of openness and multi-tenant characteristic  of the cloud, the content of data security and privacy protection  in cloud has its particularities.  The concept of privacy is very different in different  countries, cultures or jurisdictions. The definition adopted by  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD) [11] is ""any information relating to an identified or  648 Authorized licensed use limited to: Aarhus University. Downloaded on June 17,2020 at 11:10:27 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.    identifiable individual (data subject)."" Another popular  definition provided by the American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Canadian Institute of  Chartered Accountants (CICA) in the Generally Accepted  Privacy Principles (GAPP) standard is “The rights and  obligations of individuals and organizations with respect to the  collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal  information.” Generally speaking, privacy is associated with  the collection, use, disclosure, storage, and destruction of  personal data (or personally identifiable information, PII).  Identification of private information depends on the specific  application scenario and the law, and is the primary task of  privacy protection.  The next several sections analyze data security and privacy  protection issues in cloud around the data life cycle.  A. Data Life Cycle  Data life cycle refers to the entire process from generation  to destruction of the data. The data life cycle is divided into  seven stages. See the figure below:    Figure 2.  Data life cycle  B. Data Generation  Data generation is involved in the data ownership. In the  traditional IT environment, usually users or organizations own  and manage the data. But if data is to be migrated into cloud, it  should be considered that how to maintain the data ownership.  For personal private information, data owners are entitled to  know what personal information being collected, and in some  cases, to stop the collection and use of personal information.  C. Transfer  Within the enterprise boundaries, data transmission usually  does not require encryption, or just have a simple data  encryption measure. For data transmission across enterprise  boundaries, both data confidentiality and integrity should be  ensured in order to prevent data from being tapped and  tampered with by unauthorized users. In other words, only the  data encryption is not enough. Data integrity is also needed to  be ensured. Therefore it should ensure that transport protocols  provide both confidentiality and integrity.  Confidentiality and integrity of data transmission need to  ensure not only between enterprise storage and cloud storage  but also between different cloud storage services. In other  words, confidentiality and integrity of the entire transfer  process of data should be ensured.  D. Use  For the static data using a simple storage service, such as  Amazon S3, data encryption is feasible. However, for the static  data used by cloud-based applications in PaaS or SaaS model,  data encryption in many cases is not feasible. Because data  encryption will lead to problems of indexing and query, the  static data used by Cloud-based applications is generally not  encrypted. Not only in cloud, but also in traditional IT  environment, the data being treated is almost not encrypted for  any program to deal with. Due to the multi-tenant feature of  cloud computing models, the data being processed by cloud- based applications is stored together with the data of other  users. Unencrypted data in the process is a serious threat to data  security.  Regarding the use of private data, situations are more  complicated. The owners of private data need to focus on and  ensure whether the use of personal information is consistent  with the purposes of information collection and whether  personal information is being shared with third parties, for  example, cloud service providers.  E. Share  Data sharing is expanding the use range of the data and  renders data permissions more complex. The data owners can  authorize the data access to one party, and in turn the party can  further share the data to another party without the consent of  the data owners. Therefore, during data sharing, especially  when shared with a third party, the data owners need to  consider whether the third party continues to maintain the  original protection measures and usage restrictions.  Regarding sharing of private data, in addition to  authorization of data, sharing granularity (all the data or partial  data) and data transformation are also need to be concerned  about. The sharing granularity depends on the sharing policy  and the division granularity of content. The data transformation  refers to isolating sensitive information from the original data.  This operation makes the data is not relevant with the data  owners.  F. Storage  The data in the cloud may be divided into: (1) The data in  IaaS environment, such as Amazon's Simple Storage Service;  (2) The data in PaaS or SaaS environment related to cloud- based applications.  The data stored in the cloud storages is similar with the  ones stored in other places and needs to consider three aspects  of information security: confidentiality, integrity and  availability.  The common solution for data confidentiality is data  encryption. In order to ensure the effective of encryption, there  needs to consider the use of both encryption algorithm and key  strength. As the cloud computing environment involving large  amounts of data transmission, storage and handling, there also  needs to consider processing speed and computational  649 Authorized licensed use limited to: Aarhus University. Downloaded on June 17,2020 at 11:10:27 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.    efficiency of encrypting large amounts of data. In this case, for  example, symmetric encryption algorithm is more suitable than  asymmetric encryption algorithm.  Another key problem about data encryption is key  management. Is who responsible for key management? Ideally,  it’s the data owners. But at present, because the users have not  enough expertise to manage the keys, they usually entrust the  key management to the cloud providers. As the cloud providers  need to maintain keys for a large number of users, key  management will become more complex and difficult.  In addition to data confidentiality, there also needs to be  concerned about data integrity. When the users put several GB  (or more) data into the cloud storage, they how to check the  integrity of the data? As rapid elasticity feature of cloud  computing resources, the users don’t know where their data is  being stored. To migrate out of or into the cloud storage will  consume the user's network utilization (bandwidth) and an  amount of time. And some cloud providers, such as Amazon,  will require users to pay transfer fees. How to directly verify  the integrity of data in cloud storage without having to first  download the data and then upload the data is a great challenge.  As the data is dynamic in cloud storage, the traditional  technologies to ensure data integrity may not be effective.  In the traditional IT environment, the main threat of the  data availability comes from external attacks. In the cloud,  however, in addition to external attacks, there are several other  areas that will threat the data availability: (1) The availability  of cloud computing services; (2) Whether the cloud providers  would continue to operate in the future? (3) Whether the cloud  storage services provide backup?  G. Archival  Archiving for data focuses on the storage media, whether  to provide off-site storage and storage duration. If the data is  stored on portable media and then the media is out of control,  the data are likely to take the risk of leakage. If the cloud  service providers do not provide off-site archiving, the  availability of the data will be threatened. Again, whether  storage duration is consistent with archival requirements?  Otherwise, this may result in the availability or privacy threats.    H. Destruction  When the data is no longer required, whether it has been  completely destroyed? Due to the physical characteristics of  storage medium, the data deleted may still exist and can be  restored. This may result in inadvertently disclose of sensitive  information.  IV. CURRENT SECURITY SOLUTIONS FOR DATA SECURITY  AND PRIVACY PROTECTION  IBM developed a fully homomorphic encryption scheme in  June 2009. This scheme allows data to be processed without  being decrypted [12]. Roy I and Ramadan HE applied  decentralized information flow control (DIFC) and differential  privacy protection technology into data generation and  calculation stages in cloud and put forth a privacy protection  system called airavat [13]. This system can prevent privacy  leakage without authorization in Map-Reduce computing  process. A key problem for data encryption solutions is key  management. On the one hand, the users have not enough  expertise to manage their keys. On the other hand, the cloud  service providers need to maintain a large number of user keys.  The Organization for the Advancement of Structured  Information Standards (OASIS) Key Management  Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) is trying to solve such issues  [14].  About data integrity verification, because of data  communication, transfer fees and time cost, the users can not  first download data to verify its correctness and then upload the  data. And as the data is dynamic in cloud storage, traditional  data integrity solutions are no longer suitable. NEC Labs's  provable data integrity (PDI) solution can support public data  integrity verification [15]. Cong Wang proposed a  mathematical way to verify the integrity of the data  dynamically stored in the cloud [16].  In the data storage and use stages, Mowbray proposed a  client-based privacy management tool [17]. It provides a user- centric trust model to help users to control the storage and use  of their sensitive information in the cloud. Munts-Mulero  discussed the problems that existing privacy protection  technologies (such as K anonymous, Graph Anonymization,  and data pre-processing methods) faced when applied to large  data and analyzed current solutions [18]. The challenge of data  privacy is sharing data while protecting personal privacy  information. Randike Gajanayake proposed a privacy  protection framework based on information accountability (IA)  components [19]. The IA agent can identify the users who are  accessing information and the types of information they use.  When inappropriate misuse is detected, the agent defines a set  of methods to hold the users accountable for misuse.  About data destruction, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)  5220.22-M (the National Industrial Security Program  Operating Manual) shows two approved methods of data  (destruction) security, but it does not provide any specific  requirements for how these two methods are to be achieved  [20]. The National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) Special Publication [21], 800-88, gives a“Guidelines  for Media Sanitization.”   V. CONCLUSION  Although cloud computing has many advantages, there are  still many actual problems that need to be solved. According to  a Gartner survey about cloud computing revenues, market size  for Public and Hybrid cloud is $59 billion and it will reach  USD 149B by 2014 with a compound annual growth rate of  20[22]. The revenue estimation implies that cloud computing is  a promising industry. But from another perspective, existing  vulnerabilities in the cloud model will increase the threats from  hackers.  According to service delivery models, deployment models  and essential features of the cloud computing, data security and  privacy protection issues are the primary problems that need to  be solved as soon as possible. Data security and privacy issues  650 Authorized licensed use limited to: Aarhus University. Downloaded on June 17,2020 at 11:10:27 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.    exist in all levels in SPI service delivery models and in all  stages of data life cycle.  The challenges in privacy protection are sharing data while  protecting personal information. The typical systems that  require privacy protection are e-commerce systems that store  credit cards and health care systems with health data. The  ability to control what information to reveal and who can  access that information over the Internet has become a growing  concern. These concerns include whether personal information  can be stored or read by third parties without consent, or  whether third parties can track the web sites someone has  visited. Another concern is whether web sites which are visited  collect, store, and possibly share personal information about  users. The key to privacy protection in the cloud environment  is the strict separation of sensitive data from non-sensitive data  followed by the encryption of sensitive elements.   According to the analysis for data security and privacy  protection issues above, it is expected to have an integrated and  comprehensive security solution to meet the needs of defense  in depth. Regarding privacy protection, privacy data  identification and isolation are the primary tasks. They should  be considered during the design of cloud-based applications.  VI. FUTURE WORK  For data security and privacy protection issues, the  fundamental challenges are separation of sensitive data and  access control. Our objective is to design a set of unified  identity management and privacy protection frameworks across  applications or cloud computing services. As mobility of  employees in organizations is relatively large, identity  management system should achieve more automatic and fast  user account provisioning and de-provisioning in order to  ensure no un-authorized access to organizations’ cloud  resources by some employees who has left the organizations.  Authorization and access control mechanisms should achieve a  unified, reusable and scalable access control model and meet  the need of fine-grained access authorization. Accountability  based privacy protection mechanisms will achieve dynamical  and real-time inform, authorization and auditing for the data  owners when their private data being accessed.
