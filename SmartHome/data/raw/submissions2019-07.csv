c7lpgn,1561940520,Help me understand LED light strips?,"Presently I have some cheap led strips from home depot. They work well enough in that each strip is about 12 inches long and the connecting strips are long enough to go under one cabinet and back up into the center of the next.

Right now they're hooked up to a smart plug. Which is fine as my smartthings and Google can turn them on and off, but I'm wanting something that may be brighter as well as have more colors. I don't want to drop the money on hue.

So here's where I'm needing guidance. Can any led strip work with any led controller? Are they truly that mix and match? I just find some strips I like and a smart controller and I'm golden?

Also, I'm going to likely need a Y connector to split the strip in two directions from the most convenient plug. How does that factor in? I guess if any controller works with any strip all the extension type cables are the same too?

And finally, I do only want like foot long pieces. So they can be nested up in the under part of each cabinet. Some shit I see on Amazon is feet of strips. I don't know how I would make that work. I can't solder or do anything crazy.

Could one of you led strip pros help point me in the right direction? After I finish redoing that lighting I have lots of little things around I'd like to add led strips to.

&amp;#x200B;

The setup in my bedroom is actually extremely stupid. The light switch by the door doesn't control the overhead light, it controls the outlet that the overhead light is plugged into. So if I turn the light off I loose my entire outlet, including the power bar to charge my phone and such. For the past few years I've dealt with it just by unplugging my overhead light and using a tall lamp beside my bed. However it doesn't lend much light to the whole of my room.

I'm pessimistic about finding a sensible and normal solution for this, so my goal is to find a smart plug that will just reset if it loses its internet connection so that I can use that smartplug to automatically reboot the router whenever I have problems.

c85h3m,1562046575,"New Home Smart Locks, Thermostat, Doorbell, and Garage Door","My wife and I are building a new home and are researching which ecosystem would be best to invest in. We are starting with the front door lock, thermostat, doorbell, and garage doors and are looking for suggestions on which might be best for our use cases. We use iOS primarily, and would like each of these technologies to work seamlessly with one another. 

For a thermostat, we prefer control over automation, which has us leaning toward the Ecobee over the Nest. For the front door locks, we would err on the side of reliability and ease of use over integration with lights, automation, etc. For the doorbell, it would be nice to have something responsive with quick notifications and the ability to see/hear/be notified of when someone approaches our door. We donât have much preference and havenât done much research in the garage door department. 

We use both Google Home and Alexa in different areas (though I prefer Google services), and currently have Sonos speakers for our living room area which presumably will get Google Home integration at some point.

Are there suggestions for products in each of these categories that are best-of-class? Should we worry too much about picking and sticking with an ecosystem (Google (Nest) vs. Amazon (Ring/Ecobeee by way of acquisition)?

c88994,1562068036,Opinions/Thoughts About Smart Home Setup (ADVICE NEEDED),"First time finding this awesome sub! Tons of great information here.

Over the past few months I have been piecing together a smart home system. Hereâs my setup so far:

Alexa:
(1) Echo Spot
(2) Original Echos
(2) Echo Dots

Nest E Thermostat

Ring:
Ring Video Doorbell (Original)
Ring Security System (12 Window/Door Sensors, an outside Siren, Keypad, 1 Motion Detector)

Arlo:
(3) Original Arlo Cameras Mounted Outside

Wyze:
(2) WyzeCams for Indoor Security

Additional Controls:
(4) Wi-Fi Plugs for Lamps
(1) Alexa Powered Garage Door Controller

So far, what are your opinions on this setup? Particularly, what additional elements do you think would be beneficial moving forward? Iâm thinking Smart Locks but would love some additional input.

Also, any advice on integrating these elements better? Alexa does a good job in the house but the iOS app doesnât let you view camera feeds and therefore requires three separate apps to control. Would be great if when Ring Security was armed there was a way to set motion detection to ON for all of the outdoor cameras and then feed the alerts through Alexa and/or Ring.

c8aiba,1562080889,Need an honest opinion about doorbells/locks side business,"So Iâve been thinking about this for years. I have had a keypad lock in my front door for about 6 years and I really think itâs an amazing invention.  Recently these nest doorbells have been gaining popularity and people I work with (non tech people) are so fascinated with it. The ones who have it love showing if off and the ones who donât seem very impressed. 

So my idea was this: 

Start a business where I would come to someoneâs house. Install a smart lock and doorbell camera. Show them how to use it. Set everything up they may need. And be available if they need to troubleshoot. All that for $500 including equipment. 

Now I know people can do this themselves easily but assume there is a market for this. (I believe there is because people are lazy and intimidated by technology). 

Now my other selling point would be that I am not tied down to any one company. I want to get them the best technology. 

Now what I would want is preferably a doorbell that you can view on the app. It will save some footage without a subscription, a strong keypad lock that can be accessed with an app. Iâm flexible on all this but basically am looking for the products that would be easy to use and navigate. And have the basic features whereas the complex features are not as necessary. 

The nest doorbell and Schlage lock combo on amazon for $350 seems like the best option but I wanted to get some opinions on possible other options. And just on the business model as a whole. I would one day love to expand into security cameras and other home automation but I feel the locks and doorbells are a good start.",tommy-two-toes-,/r/smarthome/comments/c8aiba/need_an_honest_opinion_about_doorbellslocks_side/,2,smarthome,8
c8aivi,1562080956,We did the Vivint thing and are going to return it (30 day free trial) but want to know what some of the sensors are so we can buy them,"We moved into our first house 1 week ago and I have always been excited to start home automation. Iâve been lurking this sub for years. We agreed to a 30 day free trial with Vivint because not much risk and I wanted to see what they had to offer. It seems like a pretty good system if youâre not into automation too much and want something quick and easy that doesnât take a lot of learning. 
I, of course, want to return it and create my own system. However, Iâm still pretty new to actually picking out which products work best for what I want. Iâm planning to use a google home hub for the panel on the wall, maybe a ring for the doorbell, and a kwikset for the automatic lock. Iâll also probably be getting a smarthings hub. Iâm mostly confused on what they used for the door sensors. A brief google and I wasnât able to find something similar. Itâs basically a tubular pressure sensor.

c8b7wl,1562084418,"If I bought this sensor kit, what else would I need?","A brief aside: For a short while, I was entertaining the idea of grabbing a Xiaomi temperature sensor and whatever extra bit would be needed to receive its data.  But the devil's in the details.  I eventually came to note that the sensor is designed to have non-defeatable polling behavior whereby it provides unpredictably intermittent temperature data at an often unusably low rate, in favor of lavishing attention on humidity data.  The graphs of temperature data from the device are correspondingly low-resolution, and I'm afraid I need something less haphazard.

Which, it would appear, brings me straight back to the oft-mentioned ESP8266+DHT22 combo.  But this is a project I am starting completely from scratch.  I have zero knowledge of what's needed.  This is certainly not to say that I am incapable of either learning or intuiting my way through the necessary steps, but I will strongly favor solutions involving pre-packaged components.  Such as this thing I spotted on Amazon:

https://www.amazon.com/ThingPulse-Wireless-Temperature-Comprehensive-Exercises/dp/B01KE7BA3O

Seems to be the two main components, some apparently solderless wires (a big plus), and a tiny screen.  As one commentor notes, the idea would be to discard the packaged DHT11 in favor of the actually usable DHT22 -- it's disappointing that there isn't already a package that does this.

Anyway, since my ultimate goal is to access (Home Assistant?) graphs showing the history of what the sensor recorded, on my Win10 PC or Android phone or both, I suspect that there is at least one further component needed to achieve this, not included in this package.  Now, the assembled hardware is powered via USB but there is probably no guarantee that the sensor's data could be accessed this way.  There is a single mention of ""WIFI"" as a product feature, but nothing to suggest that this is a capacity specifically tapped when accessing the sensor's readings -- it seems like that data is intended to display on that tiny screen and that's the end of it.

A lot of question marks surrounding this.  I feel like there is a hole available for filling in the marketing of somewhat more comprehensive room monitoring setup kits of this nature.

And incidentally, what might be other sensors worth looking into?  It had recently occurred to me that pressure might be a fascinating one to keep an eye on.  There was a time several months ago where I tried to find a way to cheaply monitor carbon dioxide, but it sadly turned out that the low demand for such a measurement arbitrarily permitted sensors to be needlessly expensive, whereas for instance carbon monoxide is extremely cheap to measure.",Fredasa,/r/homeautomation/comments/c8b7wl/if_i_bought_this_sensor_kit_what_else_would_i_need/,15,homeautomation,13

Or they would simply discontinue the line of product, etc. Basically I don't want to be locked in a closed ecosystem.

I looked further and found what I think should work:

* Aqara door sensors 
* CC2531 or its alternative on a pi3
* security camera &amp; doorbell

the question I have is the software implementation. 

1. Can Homeassistant send notification/message to multiple phones on intrusion event? 
2. How about arming a smart alarm?

c8ht36,1562116646,My first HA project was a success. Window A/C controlled by Ecobee.,"So the A/C situation in the lower floor of my house is basically a window a/c stuck through the wall (yes it's actually a window a/c, no I'm not the one who put it there), and while it's somewhat effective I always hated window a/c's for their dumbness, particularly their fondness of filling up the room with humidity once they reach their setpoint. I wanted three things from this project. I wanted the fan to shut off, I wanted the a/c being controlled from a thermistor in a more accurate location rather than right in front of itself, and I wanted for it to be able to follow a schedule of some sort. I already have an Ecobee for my heating system, so why not make it work for my dumb wall a/c too?

&amp;#x200B;

I already had been interested in HA so I was familiar with some of the basics. I first picked up a Samsung Smartthings hub and outlet, and rather quickly had a setup working that used Ecobee's API to trigger the rule I set up for the a/c outlet. It worked but I didn't like it. Too reliant on the cloud. One missed message from the cloud and I'll have an a/c that wont turn on or worse won't turn off. There was also a 5 minute delay from Ecobee's API which was annoying. I also didn't like the Smartthings setup as well so I retuned it and got a Hubitat.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to hardwire it using the Ecobee's Y1 terminal which is for A/C call, and use a Aeon [dry-contact](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0155HSUUY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) sensor as the trigger. Only issue is that I cant connect the sensor directly to the thermostat wiring since it sends 24 volts so I decided to use a [24VAC DPDT relay](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NN5ABG2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to trigger the dry contact sensor. It works perfectly and instantaneously. Now I can pretend I have central a/c and reap all the benefits of proper thermostat control. The only thing I'm not fond of is that the Zooz plug makes a beep when it turns on, and there's no way to turn it off. Also for some reason the Aeon dry-contact sensor shows up backwards in Hubitat. Closed when it's open, and open when it's closed. No biggie I just had to invert my rule but it is weird.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the A/C itself I'm using it's power state restoration feature where it remembers whether it was on or off when power is restore after a failure. On this model it sets itself to 72F with full fan speed which is perfect for this application since I rarely set it below 75 (if it can get the room down to 75 on a hot day). It also has a built-in 2 minute delay before turning the compressor on so there's no danger of damaging the compressor.

Eventually I plan on using this same setup to control the upstairs a/c's as well as my humidifier in the basement. I'm impressed at how well this works and how easy it was to set up. I'm hooked and can't wait to automate all the things.

I got a Nest thermostat recently, but I'm confused about the recent changes to the ability of 3rd parties to work with Nest.  HA and OpenHAB, as far as I know, needed the ""Nest developer"" account, and all these interactions happen on the Nest cloud then back to your local Nest thermostat via ""WWN"" (Works with Nest) feature.  Now that Nest is transitioning to WWGA (Works w/ Google Assistant), they'll stop accepting new WWN connections Aug 31st, but will continue to support 3rd party integrations for devices that are already connected to WWN.

&amp;#x200B;

So...does that mean I have 2 months to get my Nest on the legacy WWN program?  Is it too late for me to start a Nest Developer account?

There seems to be adequate documentation out there covering this combination of devices.  I was hoping for a package solution that threw light sensing into the mix -- well, if I'm wishing, I briefly looked into Geiger counters, and also double-checked to make sure CO2 sensors were still stupidly overpriced -- but it looks like if I want to have light sensing too, I need to get a separate sensor for it.

On Amazon, there seems to be basically two models.  A smaller one that requires soldering, and [a larger one with three pins](https://www.amazon.com/WINGONEER-Digital-Intensity-Resistor-Photoresistor/dp/B07B94Q1C8/) which unfortunately seems to come as a package of five minimum.

A difficulty I'd be running into here is that there are no guides out there that cover this particular piece of hardware, and guides are pretty much what I lean on.  A reviewer of the above product helpfully suggests that this sensor needs a resistor added to the mix.  That's the sort of information that a written or Youtube guide probably would have provided, and obviously it stops me in my tracks since the specifics of that requirement aren't spelled out for the layman.

c8mp84,1562151465,Apartment complex renovated and totaled half of our automation setup.,"A rant and cautionary tale for anyone doing HA in an apartment: Make sure your management knows about it AND knows how you've set up your HA. We switched \~80% of the bulbs in our house to smartbulbs w/Alexa a year and a half ago, mostly due to me having sensory processing issues and needing dimmable lighting. We used various brands of bulbs plus a couple of $8 smart switches wired directly to the fixtures for a couple of lights as well. Worked out well since all of the lights had replaceable bulbs (and the apartment had originally come with incandescents, so the electric bill promptly plummeted).

Come to find out the complex is doing minor renovations this year, replacing most of the lighting fixtures with newer LED setups. No worries, we'll just remove our bulbs. Here's the fun bit: They replaced two of the lamps with inset pot lights that are a whole unit--no replaceable bulb--and the spotlights in our kitchen which required 2 $40 smart floods were replaced with a \*horribly\* bright white LED panel. They also trashed the switches and the ceiling fan kit we put in when they installed their own.

An angry email to the management by my partner later, maintenance was able to come by and show him how to rig up dimmable switches to the panel and pot lights...so more $ down the drain for those and there's nowhere to use those pricey flood bulbs. The panel is horrendous--the manual for the model they sent us literally says it's meant for use in industrial setups like schools and warehouses, so it's no wonder the damn thing gave me a migraine as soon as they installed it.

I'm in the process of making my house 'dumb' again in preparation for an upcoming house move.  

Today, I removed a GE 12722 Z-Wave switch and attempted to replace it with a 'dumb' 
 Leviton 5601 single pole switch.  This switch is in my Living Room area.  Before I started the install, my voltage alert wand showed I had power going to the switch just fine.  After installing the dumb switch, I'm getting no power to anything in the Living Room.  My voltage alert wand doesn't pick anything up.  

I put the GE switch back in place, and I'm still not getting any power.

We are moving to a new house where nearly EVERYTHING needs to be replaced. The home has a natural gas furnace with a terrible thermostat, a swamp cooler that needs to be entirely replaced, etc. While I would love to go heatpump or geothermal, I doubt it will make financial sense, so we will almost certainly end up with a furnace and a new swamp cooler.

So, I would like a system that can control both a standard furnace, as well as a swamp cooler (likely a modern one like a breezair) - I don't care if I need to have multiple pieces but in the end, what we want:

1. Non-computerized operation as a fallback (The thermostat(s) itself can operate without being connected to a hub)
2. No external servers. I don't want to depend on some company, nor do I want to deal with that security hole in my network. Thus, I need z-wave or something similar to control it independently.
3. Proper evaporative cooler control 

Note, we can choose the cooler itself based on the ability to control it, but I haven't found any information on coolers that are different than the standard low/high/off + pump relays system.

c8zb7k,1562222440,How to break down the automation of window shutters?,"I live in an apartment complex where the rules for the external window shutters are very strict: they have to be of a certain style (width of the sections and especially color). I would like to understand how to decouple the ""shutter"" part from the ""motor"" one with automation in mind.

I believe that for basic systems there is a simple electrical switch which one pushed to close the circuit, and the shutter rolls up or down while you press the switch. With a security system at the end which triggers when the limit is reached.

Then there is probably the smarter one where the distance to roll up and down is memorized and it is enough to say to the motor ""roll up"" and it will roll up for the relevant time.

Where is it best to plug in automation?

* the low-level approach where the intelligence of the motion is handled by my software (it knows the state of the shutter and decides to move it up or down for a given time depending on the request? In other words I would always know that the the shutter is at height ""h"", between 0 and 1 - and would directly control the motor.  
PRO: I have complete control  
CON: there is the electrical part between the motor and the low tension signalling which needs to be managed (= ideally purchased as a part so that it is safe)
* the higher-level approach where I would plug into the steering mechanism and control it from there  
PRO: the steering is high level (""move shutter up to 70%"" vs ""apply signal for 7.5 seconds because the current h is 0.23"")  
CON: ""plugging in"" may not be obvious. It may mean actually plugging into the device which is on the wall, or having an open system where I can send, say, zigbee commands.

The main point of the question is to understand where to best plug into the automatic shutters system and what to look at when choosing a brand.

As an anecdote, a friend of mine bought some years ago Somfy shutters (we are in France) and is now stuck with a closed  system, incompatible with his Home Assistant installation.",WoJWoJWoJ,/r/homeautomation/comments/c8zb7k/how_to_break_down_the_automation_of_window/,1,homeautomation,5

Would this dimmer works to only control the fan speed or should I use something like Lutron Caseta (even if it won't control the light) ?

I searched and read a lot of topics regarding this, and most of the time, people had the lights and fan on the same circuit, so the HS220 would not be possible. Since for me, it's 2 different circuits, if possible, I would stay with TP-Link.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the process of moving and my wife has been asking for a ""smarter"" home for the last two years.  I'm not sure if this is the right sub but seems like the closest one I could find.  The issue I have is that I inherently don't trust many of the smart tools out there and so am looking for potentially some less popular requirements to compromise between her desire for smart things and my desire to not be listened to by large corporations/governments.  I wouldn't say I'm a doomsday nut who thinks the world is out to get him, just aware that anytime we increase the surface area of our house we increase the odds of attack.

&amp;#x200B;

With that out of the way this is the end state we would ideally like:

&amp;#x200B;

\-To be able to turn 15 lights on and off either from a controller in the bedroom or remotely

\-Have a doorbell that alerts me if someone rings it and which we can tell people to leave a package at the door.

\-Remotely view up to 3 external security cameras

\-Program a routine to turn the lights on and set the coffee maker in the morning and then turn the lights off and all the electronics off at night-Be able to lock BUT NOT unlock the door remotely.  I would prefer not having an ability to unlock the door with anything other than physically being there with a code.  Alternatively a dumb keypad lock that has auto locking would work.

\-No voice or video recording inside the house.

&amp;#x200B;

An Android phone running Tasker plugged into the wall, connected to WiFi. WiFi is on battery backup so it doesn't drop when the power does. As soon as Tasker sees the power drop it sends an email to my cell as a text. When the generator kicks in, I get another text.
The problem I have is that the second text indicates that power is back, but not it's source. Also if it is the generator running, I have no idea when the mains power is back and the generator has shut down. 

My thought was a Hall effect sensor detecting power at the service entrance and switching on or off a Bluetooth device. The Bluetooth device's connection would be detected by Tasker and used to determine where the power was coming from and send out the appropriate text. 

I'd like this to be as non-invasive as possible. The less I have to crack into the wiring, the better. I'd also like to leave the generator and transfer switch untouched for warranty reasons.

I just bought a new home and want to start getting into home automation. The first step will be replacing my central HVAC thermostat (pretty standard, heatpump for cooling and heating + 2nd stage of heating with an electric coil, all standard connections / wires).

I made some research and found two options, the Nest (3rd Generation) or the Honeywell Lyric Round 2.0.

The Nest seems to work well and easy to setup but I feel like I would always be a slave to Google with such a product and would be limited in the future if I want to work on getting the system to work completely offline.

Out of the box, the Honeywell Lyric Round 2.0  seems to offer similar functionnality, but I'm not sure what is possible with it, or if it relies heavily on the cloud like the Nest.

Basically, for now I would like to use the product as-is. In the future I would like to use something like Home Assistant or another similar product that can work completely offline if I wish.

(Note : Completely offline is not my goal. I'm fine if with using Internet with these product for extra functionnality, like geofencing, but I don't want to be forced to rely on the cloud and be forced to change my thermostat if someone decide to pull the plug on the servers)

Which product should I get? Is there another option that would work for me?

Thank you

Edit : Thank you everyone. I decided to go with the Ecobee which I haven't considered to begin with. Sounds like it can do a lot out of the box and could be taken offline and managed with Home Assistant in the future if I want to, which is pretty much what I'm looking for.

I have been looking into buying an Echo Gen2. Being the tech person that I am, I started to get curious if I could integrate Alexa into my servers by executing SSH commands.

c9l5li,1562360395,Best Electronic Setup/Base for future Smart Home,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

bought an appartment which is in a building phase right now and in the next weeks I will have to give them my plan for the electronic. So basically plan where and how many plug sockets, switches and so on. I am really planning to realize smart home technology but I dont have the budget for it now and not the time to plan what I want in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

So I basically wanted to ask you guys about your experience of how a good base for a smart home should look like, to reduce double investment or re-designing in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

About the appartment: It has 4 rooms, every room has a lan socket with one additional socket in the entrance floor; several switches for the lights, but only for lights wihin the room; switches for the blinds within the room. It is possible to add additional 7 switches for free. Kitchen has the typical additional connections (water etc.). Unfortunately no air conditioner allowed, or at least not a split one. Connection for a washing machine is available as well.

However, there are sooo many options that I'm unsure what eco-system to chose.

  
Here are my current thoughts but I would like to get other perspectives and opinions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Ecosystem:** Apple HomeKit or Brilliant (All-in-One Smart Home Control)

**Thermostat:** Nest is already in home but I am considering swapping it for EcoBees 

(Reasoning for potentially swapping out Nest: Google is messing with 3rd party integrations and Google has a bad track record on privacy)

**Voice Assistant:** Unsure, due to privacy concerns. We currently own an Amazon Echo but really only use it to play music.

**Speakers**: Sonos speakers. Great sound, slick design and they support all major voice assistants, in case we want to use one.

**Doorbell**: Ring Doorbell 2 (slightly concerned with privacy due to Amazon owning Ring)

**Cameras**: We currently own Amazon Cloud Cams but are open to any other option which is cloud-enabled. Potentially Ring cameras

**Lock**: Looking for smart lock which will allow us to remotely open the door or give a code/temporary ""key"" to our cleaner or pet sitter. Any ideas?

**Sprinkler System:** Possibly Rachio but not sure if it's even a decent investment

**Lights:** We own 3 philips Hue light bulbs but don't actually use them. We haven't found a good use case yet.  
**TV/Streaming:** We use an Apple TV for streaming. We don't watch cable and mostly rely on Amazon Prime and Netflix.

**Music Service:** Apple Music

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out what route to take - a large tablet vs a small computer monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Price**:  Much cheaper to have a 17"" or 20"" touch monitor than a similar size tablet.  Large tablets are expensive.

**Usability**:  I've never tried to combine a Raspberry Pi w/ a touch screen.  Maybe for Netflix I might opt to put a cheap chromecast back there.  A tablet would have no usability concerns.

**Mounting**:  I've been looking at VESA mounts that are extendable, so the monitor can be folded out from under the cabinet for easier viewing, and then pushed back against the wall.

&amp;#x200B;

Any opinions if you've tried this route?

c9owid,1562383068,Roborock S6 - First impressions,"I received an s6 and put it through itâs initial paces today. I have to say this thing exceeded my expectations and Iâm very happy with the purchase. Also worth noting that this is my first robot vacuum, so I donât have anything to compare it to (s5/Neato/etc). Iâll address some of the things that stood out to me below.

**Navigation**:  The first thing that stood out to me was the navigation. Wow, this thing really knows how to get around! It hugged walls and ran circles around every chair leg. It was pretty neat to see it run the perimeter of the room and then fill in the remaining area.  When it finished cleaning it went back to home station to charge without running into anything. The only place it got hung up was when it got its front edge underneath the freezer drawer. It didnât get stuck, but it took a little while for it to figure out this area...I added a no go line on the map so the next time it should just avoid this area. 

**Noise/battery**: It was way quieter than I was expecting. There are 4 power settings: quiet, balanced, turbo, max. When I first turned it on (balanced power) I wasnât sure if the brush was running because I was expecting it to be much louder. For the second run I bumped up the power to turbo because the floor is mostly carpet. On turbo power it finished cleaning the floor in 51 minutes with 54% battery remaining. 

**Disassembly**:  The build quality is quite good. It is really easy to remove the brush for cleaning and to pop out the dust bin when full. That being said I would have liked a larger dustbin, but still it wasnât quite full after the run ...so as long as I take the 10 seconds or so that it took to empty the dustbin it should be fine. We have two cats that shed like crazy so YMMV, we just hAve a ton of pet hair that it is dealing with. 

Overall Iâm really happy with it, and I think it will really help to combat the pet hair in our home. I plan to flash custom firmware on it for local  control in homeassistant and to remove the cloud dependency. I would like to be able to add it to my 3d floor plan when complete for spot-cleaning individual rooms but Iâm not yet sure if this is possible.

TLDR: Want to set up a rack in the basement for ceiling mount audio,CCTV,network and run my TV's off a single PC in the basement for streaming and movies off my server and dont know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an electrician and just bought a new house. I have to open some walls for reno's and want to use the opportunity to run all the cat6 in the world to tv's, cameras, and ceiling mount speakers. Problem is that i don't know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to set up a rack in the basement and will likely use a switch and patch panel to deal with the cabling.

&amp;#x200B;

First - I want to put a PC in the same location that will run all my TV's for watching downloaded movies and streaming. I was thinking HDMI over cat 6 for video/audio and usb to cat6 for wireless keyboards to control it. Is this possible and is there a way to run different things on different screens?

&amp;#x200B;

Second - I think i am okay with the speakers but would love to hear any input. I will likely be using a 6 channel rack mount amp for the speakers with an extra cat6 for the individual switches in the room for zone controls.

&amp;#x200B;

Third - I want to run 5 or 6 POE cameras around the house to either a recorder or to the computer itself using the server for storage.

I'm a little confused. I thought this was an add on switch that could be used with my GoControl/Linear switches that I have, but that does not appear to be the case. I bought a few because they were $15.

It looks like it's a virtual 3 way switch? I'm having a hard time understanding what these are for.

Even the instructions don't make sense to me. There's only one black wire, instead of two, line and load. Do I wire both to the switch? Hopefully someone can help me understand, cause I don't know Wtf... lol.

I do have an idea that has been floating around in my head regarding my kitchen lights. I have 6 hue color bulbs in the cans in my kitchen and they are on dumb switches. Everyone knows to just leave them on. I've been considering wiring them in such a way where they are always powered and using switches to just turn them off without turning off power. Is that something these could be used for?


:EDIT:

Alright, it looks like I may have figured out. Both line and load wire to the black on the switch, traveler is capped off and this switched is used to control the master switch through automations, hence the ""virtual"" 3way switch I saw referenced about this switch. I'll start messing around in HA and see what i can get done with it. I e seen people mention addon switches that do not use traveler wires, but I've never used them as I have a combination of GE and GO Control switches, so it was a little odd to me.

c9zz0z,1562454482,Outdoor Gate Lock,"I'm trying to figure out what I need for an outdoor gate. Let me quickly describe our setup and what I'm trying to get (terrible paint drawing provided).

https://i.redd.it/tcxpromqlr831.jpg

Our home is in a U shape, and we'd like to build a gate to close off the open end of the U.  We plan to do this with a new stucco wall and a new gate. The questions I have relate to how best to control the lock on the new gate.

My ideal setup involves:

\-A wired button on the inside of the wall, next to the gate, for easy opening.

\-A wireless button on the inside of the front door, to open it from inside the house.

\-A Keypad on the outside of the gate, for regular, trusted access. (ourselves, friends, etc.)

\-Smart connectivity of some sort (zigbee/z-wave), for remote opening.

My current plan is to put in an electric lock on the gate (be it a magnetic lock, electric strike, or otherwise). I assume that, with the right lock, both a physical button on the inside of the new wall and a keypad on the outside of the wall both be easy enough. To avoid tearing up the existing entry patio area, I think a wireless button near the front door would be best. Then a smart relay of some sort can handle the rest.

Most of my smart home stuff is 'plug and play' (wink hub, lutron lights) so I'd really appreciate any advice on specific locks, keypads, relays, or other issues I may have overlooked. My primary concern is reliability and easy of use. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my searching so far, I think I need [a kit similar to this](https://www.maglocks.com/complete-single-door-magnetic-lock-kit.html), and to pair it with [a Z-Wave bridge like this](https://www.fortrezz.com/shop/mimo-lite), perhaps putting the Z-Wave bridge where the Remote Release button [is in this wiring diagram](https://www.maglocks.com/mm5/graphics/00000001/completesinglemaglockrev4.17_1000x709.jpg). Even then I'd still need a physical button/switch that would work for inside the front door.

ca454w,1562483289,Recommended system for controlling a fan based on relative temperature?,"Hi.

I'm looking to control a window fan:  My computer is in an upstairs room that gets very hot on a sunny day, but running a fan all of the time can be counterproductive.  So I'd like to automate that.

I'd like the fan to be on whenever it is warmer inside than it is outside.

For outside temperature, I can be very happy with scraping Web pages or using whatever data is available online.  And I would prefer not having an outside temperature probe.  (NOAA has very accurate thermometers near enough to me with their data available to the world.  And accurately measuring temperature in a sunny place isn't necessarily trivial or easy, and I don't want to re-invent that wheel)

For inside temperature, I'll need some sort of temperature-sensing dingus (preferably working over Wifi, but other ideas like Zigbee will certainly be entertained).

For switching the fan on and off, I'll need some manner of smart outlet.

For logic, I'll need a quick little script that turns on the fan's outlet whenever the inside temperature is greater than the outside temperature (and turns it back off when the converse is true).  This doesn't have to be terribly timely; if it makes this comparison once or twice per hour, that's fine.

And finally, it's fine with me if this thing lives on the Internet somewhere:  I don't need to host the software side myself.  (Although I can certainly run whatever operating systems and software makes it easiest to do on a LAN.)

Questions, then:

1.  What software do I want to use?  IFTTT, for instance, doesn't seem to work with real-time temperature data at all.  Are there others that do -- or can be talked into doing so?

2.  What smart outlet and connected indoor thermometer do I want to use for this?",ssl-3,/r/smarthome/comments/ca454w/recommended_system_for_controlling_a_fan_based_on/,4,smarthome,8

Anyone know of a good rail meter that supports wifi and which I can use with some kind of open firmware? If not possible one that will work out of the box with Home Automation?

From what I can see they uses two wires for power, and two for communication, which would be transmit (TX) and receive (RX).  They have to use some sort of serial communication. If I were to get ahold of one of those keypads, and hook it up to and Arduino or Raspberry Pi, would I be able to collect some meaningful data from them?  You could then just retransmit those commands from the Arduino/Pi to Home Assistant or whatever to get your desired result.

Those arrived today.  A quick test of the LED confirmed that the device is working and I can communicate with it.  To be frank, I expected that part of this project to be the biggest stumbling block.

What I didn't expect was to encounter a seemingly unresolvable issue with Home Assistant itself, given that it is _much_ more widely used, documented, troubleshooted and supported than my relatively esoteric combination of hardware bits.

I can't get the thing to work.  It keeps stalling at this:

__INFO (MainThread) [homeassistant.core] Timer:starting__

I've tried --demo-mode and that returns the following error:

__coroutine 'async_from_config_dict' was never awaited log_file=args.log_file, log_no_color=args.log_no_color)__

Both of these issues have been noted by other users already.  A testament to the popularity of Home Assistant.  Unfortunately, solutions were not forthcoming in any of those instances.  The closest thing approaching a ""solution"" anyone seems to have ever found is to completely reinstall Windows itself, which is of course not going to happen and should not be a requirement to bypass whatever is causing this thing to choke.

I've told my firewall and virus checker to ignore everything associated with Python / HA.  I've tried every version of Python from 3.5.3 to 3.7.  I've tried several older versions of HA (and actually they have all outright failed to legit errors, including a syntax error in one instance).

I don't know what else to do.  The hardware's sitting there, waiting.

Is there, perhaps, some _other_ monitoring, graphing and data-storing app I can use to keep track of what this sensor detects?  I feel like that would be a very acceptable solution.

cak1mt,1562586621,Whole Home Audio Software,"Hi folks,

I've been having trouble finding a cheap whole home audio setup that fits my needs - I'm a little fussy in that I'd like it to be able to work offline; have the option to be in full control and do 'interesting things' such as layering broadcasts over current audio streams (lowering music and broadcasting ""Kids come down for dinner""); respond to changes in an audio input (automatically pipe music to a room when audio is detected on an input channel); as well as have a nice web display / control for all the rooms audio controls; stuff like that. 

I'm at the point of considering rolling my own whole home audio server which would give me exactly what I want. The current idea is to have controller software that can take multiple inputs from a number of sources (be they line in or other applications/services); conditionally apply various modifications (mixing, splitting, audio effects, etc) and map to a number of outputs. The resultant audio would then be sent out via sound card(s); fed to a power amplifier and finally onward to ceiling speakers. This all sounds well and good to me but I'm basically wanting a bit of a sanity check before I go down this route. 

* Are there any products out there that fit the bill already and I'm being dense?
* Is there any software out there that fits the bill already and I'm being blind?
* Are there any gotchas that I haven't thought of?
* Would this be of use / interest to anybody else as I'm happy to open source it as I go?

cam8kl,1562598565,How to embed a live Wyze V2 camera (rtsp) video feed into a website?,"I am using a raspberry pi 3B+ as my web server. 

I am trying to add a rtsp video feed from my Wyze V2 camera (Loaded the Wyze camera with the Wyze RTSP camera firmware) to the garage-door-controller website. I can not get this to work. If some one has done this before or knows how to do this, please help!!

Additional info:
Started with this project(python2 project):
https://github.com/andrewshilliday/garage-door-controller
I use a ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) instead of a magnetic switch sensor to determine if the garage door is in the âopenâ or âclosedâ state.  I also use a vibration sensor (SW-420) to determine if the  garage door motor is currently running (helps in determining the âopeningâ or âclosingâ states). This garage door is activate by pressing a button on the website.

I added the ability to have relay switches recognized by Alexa as fauxmo [fake Wemo Devices] by using this project (python3 project):
https://github.com/nassir-malik/IOT-Pi3-Alexa-Automation
I use the ultrasonic sensor and vibration sensor to determine what state the garage is in before executing the code that allowed the garage door to be activated. The garage door is activated by voice command.

Both the programs run on the same raspberry pi by using two different scripts. I did not want to rewrite the fauxmo python code in python-twisted because python-twisted is not going to be ported over to python3.

I edited both scripts to add the programming logic to access both the ultrasonic sensor and vibration sensor into the python-twisted code (python2) and the python3 code.

Both scripts work, no errors.

I like to reuse others work as much as possible!

I really like the website from https://github.com/andrewshilliday/garage-door-controller.  He has the dynamic buttons that show the doors current state.  All I want to do is add my Wyze V2 cameraâs video live feed into the website so I can see the inside of the garage!

I have tried using âMotionâ but I can not embed the stream I get from âmotionâ into the website. I placed âmotionâ on the same raspberry pi and ran all thee processes: (Motion, python2 script which displays the website, and python3  script which recognizes Alexa commends) and my CPU utilization went to 60%.  Thatâs when I decide to use another raspberry pi to handle the live rtsp stream.

I did manage to embed a Tinycam Pro web server (running on amazon Fire TV Stick 4K) stream of my Wyze C2 camera into the website but I would prefer to use another raspberry pi to host the camera web server. My fire TV Stick is not always on.

So I bought another raspberry pi to add to this project. What I am going to try to do next is the following and I need help in determining if this is the correct method to get an embed rtsp stream into an html page?

Here is the HTML code for the website:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZhISduxthVw6qsyzo-e-0Yyz2WQ02Cf/view?usp=drivesdk

Try:
I will use the free web server ânginxâ on another raspberry pi 3B+ (with the rtmp module)

Is this the correct flow? 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjLTXO3nph3m42Hbb72QtZe0cLwsuXnv/view?usp=drivesdk

More Detail:
input video file or stream (http, rtmp, rtsp, whatever) goes to ffmpeg (transcodes live to 
x.264 + aac, outputs to rtmp) goes to nginx which takes the rtmp and serves a HLS to the user (client). So on the client side you can use the .m3u8 file which is provided by nginx.

Will ffmpeg translate a live stream continuously ??
Will nginx translate the rtmp steam continuously to HLS??

Here is the ffmpeg statement I found. Will this work to translate the rtsp stream to HLS continuously?

ffmpeg -i ""rtsp://yourRtspStreamSource"" -hls_time 3 -hls_wrap 10 ""yourOutputDir/streaming.m3u8""

If I can translate directly from rtsp to HLS continuously, do I even need the ânginxâ web server??

Once the rtsp stream is converted to HLS do I use Video.Js as the embedded video player??

Do I use THIS for Video.js??

cb1h7y,1562681978,Current and future ceiling fan switch options?,"TLDR: Are there any current or forthcoming paddle-style ceiling fan switches I should consider besides GE?

I will be installing a ceiling fan this evening, a new install with 14/3 wire going to the wall box (i.e. independent hardwired control of the light and fan). 

The fan light will be tied in with other lights in the room on its own single-gang dimmer, and the fan will be controlled by its own switch. There is a neutral in the box, and I would prefer the paddle-style switches over buttons like the Hampton Bay fan controller or Caseta switches. I have the Smartthings hub, and z-wave plus would be great. I want it to be a real hardwired switch and not rely on any remotes or repeaters like Bond. 

Reading through the [ceiling fan control FAQ](https://community.smartthings.com/t/faq-2018-ceiling-fan-and-dimmer-light-wall-mount-control-compatible-with-smartthings-and-alexa/98373/3) on the ST forum, the GE fan control looks closest to what I am looking for.

I thought that was really good pricing for someone not in the trade, blows the parts home depot stocks out of the water, but it was still way more than I wanted to spend on a panel that will have 34 spaces filled. If you reach out to them with a big enough order they cut the advertised prices they have on their site a bit. The panel is $108 straight off their site. In any case, I reached out to Leviton and they said any distributor has access to all the smart stuff as of 7/1.",xkegsx,/r/homeautomation/comments/cb7w7m/leviton_load_center_smart_parts_are_out_xpost/,2,homeautomation,10

cbdo87,1562744027,control single diodes on multiple shelves?,"Hi everybody,

I just finished insulating and re-wiring our garage/shed and am planning on turning part of it into a storage unit for household items and food/water, basically anything canned or dry enough to be out there and has long shelf life. 

The smaller room is about 6.5x10 feet (or 2x3 meters) and has shelves on both longer walls. There will be a raspberry pi with an attached barcode scanner that will allow us to scan items to put them on a shopping list (pi ==mqtt==&gt; node-red ==&gt; mariadb ==&gt; ....). That gave me an idea: while this database contains details such as EAN, item name, count and store to buy it from, I could also enter the location.

For example, `467379482712 - bottled water - 2 - rewe - A - 3`, where `A` would be the shelf itself and `3` the actual level (? sorry, not a native speaker) on it. 

So I could just print a sheet containing all item names with their appropriate barcode; if one cannot locate a particular item on the shelves right away, they could scan the barcode on the sheet and - because the database already knows the location - display the location.

I am going to implement a little 20x4 LCD panel to display this information, but I thought it'd be a good learning experience to additionally put a regular diode on each shelf (and each level) and have it light up accordingly. So If I need the bottled water, I'll display something like ""Bottled Water \n Count: 2\n @A-3` on the LCD display and also light up or flash an LED accordingly on ""subshelf"" 3 on shelf A. If that works, I could even go nuts and put a piezo next to each diode :D

Yeah, this is totally out of proportion. This is not a big storage facility and there won't be millions of items... But if this can be achieved, I'll do it just for fun and to learn how to do it. I have been using raspberry pis for quite some time, but always just as ""regular, small computers"". Using its GPIOs offers so much more and I'd like to use that potential.

My main concern is controlling the diodes. Let's say I have 6 shelves with 5 ""subshelves"" each. So 30 diodes to control and address individually. That gives me two problems:

1. can the raspberry pi control this many diodes individually? There won't be enough GPIO pins just for that, but I'll have a few HATs, maybe the I2C extension will be able to do this? If not, what should I use?

2. these LEDs will run on 3.3V; the raspberry pi will be placed in one corner of the room, so the shelves further away would require wires multiple feet long. Will the current even light up those LEDs?

Just to clarify: I would like to use those little diodes, not LED strips or similar. While I have some controllable LED strips (WS something, the ones where you can control each LEDs color individually), I don't think they will work because there are many LEDs on small space (20 per meter or so), and I need to provide for a small-ish number (~30) in a rather large space (dimensions mentioned above).

I don't need to use raspberry pis. I have a bunch of nodeMCUs as well, but I think it'd be overkill to use one per subshelf, or even per shelf (6 nodeMCU constantly running and using energy for wifi just to light a few diodes seems overkill even for me).

They seem pretty slick for something like a theater or bedroom where you might want full light sometimes but also a dim glow other times. The fixture as a whole is dimmable, but idk if you can dim both the main and night light. 

The only thing is, you have to select which light you use by flicking the light switch...flip it on and they come on full. Flip it on-off-on and the night light comes on. 

I think I'll buy one to experiment with. I have Smartthings and where I'd use these is currently on a Caseta dimmer, so here must be a way to set up some Webcore piston and Google voice command to, say, turn the lights on 1%, then off, then 100% to get the nightlights on without first blinding you. 

I might also try to disassemble it to see if I can just wire the nightlight separately to have it on its own switch....",tomgabriele,/r/homeautomation/comments/cbkflv/has_anyone_used_the_commercial_electric_recessed/,1,homeautomation,0

Recently we got our first smart plug by amazon. We're an Amazon/Alexa household, so we want to dive a little deeper into the world of smart lights.

We have a street light that lights up our driveway. However, the light switch is very inconveniently placed. Without getting a smart light bulb, we were wondering if we could just make the light switch a smart switch. 

On Amazon, we saw that we could. However, we have a specific sort of problem. As you can see in the [photo](https://imgur.com/MDPTKeR), there is a horizontal light switch (the one that controls the street light) and a vertical light switch controlling an interior hallway light.

Is there any way to make the horizontal switch smart, compatible with Alexa? Thank you!",evanant124,/r/homeautomation/comments/cbmc9z/automating_a_sideways_light_switch/,1,homeautomation,5

Everything was in her deceased husbandâs name. Including the security system. The last couple of days Iâve been disconnecting her internet, canceling the lawn care company, and ATTEMPTING to cancel the security system.

First attempt: I accidentally set it off when I entered the house. I called the business and after nearly an hour they told me that I needed to send proof I bought the house and that they would call me and weâd get it figured out. I send the paper work... no phone call or confirmation they got my email. The deceased husbandâs name is on the security system, the wifeâs isnât..

Attempt 2: I try again the next day. After several failed transfers, I finally speak to someone (after like two hours). They tell me I need to the death certificate of the deceased husband before they can cancel the system.. I never met this man, idk what town or state he may have passed in.. I uneventfully hung up. 

I finally called the ladies son (POA) and explained to him what was going on. He tells me that the security system company wanted to charge her $300.00 to cancel her system (after being a consumer for 20 years.) he tells me to keep it disarmed and the company can keep billing the dead husband (my worry was that they shared a bank account and sheâs getting charges for it.)

Idk if I can list company names, but when chasing a security system.. make sure they donât want your soul at the end of that dotted line. ð",steel_marigold,/r/homeautomation/comments/cboxtm/home_security_vent/,9,homeautomation,29

I own the nicest house in a not so nice neighborhood, I'm looking for a matte black camera system with 1-3 cameras and a way to view easily from the kitchen. Any suggestions?

cc4osq,1562896949,New wall and light switch...,"Hoping I can get some good advice/ideas for my situation...

Just moved into a new house that has a dining room at the front with an open wall on the east side as its entryway. The light switch for the ceiling fixture is in the hallway _outside_ the room â essentially the northeast corner.

## CURRENT

               â â¬ï¸ Existing switch
               â    â
    ââââââââââââ    â

               â    â

I am using this room as my home office, and this weekend I will be closing off the entryway with a wall and a door (some friends are coming to help me out who know a lot more about such things, but, and this is important, none of us are electricians).

The new door will be on the north side of the new wall, and I want the switch to move to _inside_ the room on the south side of the door.

##NEW
               â â¬ï¸ Remove switch
               â    â
    ââââââââââââ    â

               â    â

Actually _moving_ the existing switch, I assume, would involve me tearing up the existing wall, plus there's the whole ""none of us are electricians"" thing. So I don't think that's a realistic option.

What are some realistic options here? I _eventually_ want to start adding some smart lighting to the house, but for now, I need to keep costs down (I'm paying for a new wall right now after all). I do absolutely want a wall switch, though... don't want to have to interact with a hub or an app to turn the lights on and off.

Ideas I've thought of (not sure if any of these are good):

* I could remove the existing switch itself and just connect the wires so the light is always on (is that even possible) and put a blank face plate over the hole. Then install a smart bulb and a wireless switch ([like this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016AEHU70))
* I could add a wireless controller to the existing switch and then put the new switch in place ([something like this](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Wireless-Switch-Kit-Self-Powered/dp/B012H6QZVC)) ...this seems pretty pricey.
* Something else?

For any of the solutions, what are the products/brands that you recommend?

To throw a wrench in the works, I'm hoping to get a black fixture to match the rest of the room if possible (although I'm thinking that might not happen).

Thanks in advance to anyone who gives me their advice! ð

From what I understand, I have at least a couple of options for an interface box that can speak X10 over the AC lines and hook up to WiFi and more modern smart devices.

If Iâm understanding correctly, each X10 device can be either addressed individually or in groups but bandwidth for communication is very low so you want to make sure groups are sensible so you can issue a command for all switches in a group to turn on, rather than issue one command after another, which causes a âsequential effectâ of lights all over the house responding one after the other.

cchatp,1562968867,Advice: best options for replacing normal switch with smart home enabled light switch with separate physical option/remote,"Apologies for the title, couldn't find the words to describe what I'm looking for. I have a lot of Philips Hue, Wemo, and Kasa products, but after a while of online searching I couldn't find much that met what I'm looking for and was hoping the community could help. I figure there's stuff out there, I just don't know the correct keywords.




The problem: my kitchen light switch is on a wall outside my kitchen. Cue walking into dark kitchen, trying to flip switch, failing because it's outside kitchen, walking out, turning lights on. Every day.




What I'd like: I want to be able to have something physical that I can hit in the kitchen to turn the lights on and off. This would be used by sleepy-me, guests, etc. I'd also like to be able to turn the lights on and off remotely, using my phone and/or Google Home.




The current light switch is a double, with one side being a dimmer for the dining room lights (which doesn't work) and the other being a single pole light switch for the kitchen.




The thing I found that looked the most promising was the Lutron Caseta, but it requires a Lutron smart bridge, the switch for the wall, and the remote which is $72. Would love to find an option that's at least half this price, especially since I'm renting and don't intend to get more Lutron products.",wearing_yellow_shirt,/r/smarthome/comments/cchatp/advice_best_options_for_replacing_normal_switch/,1,smarthome,4

I've toyed around with the idea of posting here, not quite sure what direction that I wanted to go or how I wanted to ask. I am a new homeowner, and I'm very interested in going the route of a smart home but I dont know where I want to begin.

One of the things that has drawn my attention is a system like vivint has, however I know they're terrible and would like to not go that route. I'm hoping you can help.

First, I'm looking for a recommended smartlock. I need to be able to do the following:

- App can control multiple, as I will at least have two.
- Beginning to think keypad is preferable. I like the kwikset kevo but I don't like the idea of it failing, nor inconveniencing a contractor or someone to download the app and create an account.
- Ability to lock, unlock, receive notifications from anywhere is recommended.
- I like kwikset smartkey however that may not be a reality.

The other thing I'm interested in is cameras. I'm concerned about running wiring but that may be inevitable. Again being able to receive alerts on motion and see video from my phone would be nice.

The main goal is to begin piecing everything together now... Don't want to buy things then waste money by going a different direction later.

ccmg6y,1563001409,MyQ breaks wifi,"Very odd. I haven't really found any threads on Reddit or otherwise, so I figured I'd ask.

I have the Chamberlain MyQ Home Bridge. It connects to my garage door opener as a remote, and has a sensor that's on the garage door itself. It worked fine for a couple months. Not sure what happened, but it started breaking my home wifi. Like, anytime I opened the garage door (even when not using it from the app!) my wifi completely goes down.

The router is an Asus RT-AC66U, so it's not terribly old. ISP is fiber and I'm not about to change my 100/100 for a smart garage door lol.

ccmum6,1563004821,Bob Ross is keeping an eye on my fridge temperature!,"I am a ST user, but I'm sure this could be accomplished with any home automation platform using the same hardware and a different or modified Arduino sketch.

Ok so, [last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/br6gfn/is_there_a_smart_outlet_or_some_other_solution/), the GFCI outlet that our garage freezer is attached to tripped. No idea why. First time it happened, and hasn't happened since. Soon after, I noticed the garage had a bad smell. OH NO!! :(  All the food thawed and spoiled. I have since deep cleaned and bleached it. Now, somewhat sadly, all we have in there are some popsicles and a box of Texas Toast. Totally starting over. #sad. After some research, surprisingly, I really didn't find much out there to monitor temperature of a freezer. A few options, such as [Sensor Push](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AEQ9X9I) or [Lacrosse Alerts](https://www.amazon.com/Crosse-Alerts-926-25101-GP-Wireless-Monitor/dp/B0081UR76G/), but I didn't want to spend a lot, and definitely didn't want to have an additional monthly charge.

A couple weeks of research later I came up with this solution, and it only cost me around $18. (about $5 for the board, $10 for the sensor, $3 for the tin - I ate the mints BONUS!!, I already had the IDE cable) I wasn't sure if it would work, but for under 20 bucks it was worth the risk. Plus it sounded like a fun project.

Inside is an [NodeMCU ESP8266](https://www.google.com/search?q=nodemcu&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS852US852&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuz6OJr7HjAhXMVc0KHQlZD_oQ_AUIECgB&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1085) board hooked up to a [DS18B20](https://www.adafruit.com/product/381) temp sensor. Talking to Smartthings via [ST\_Anything](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/blob/master/README.md). If the temp gets above freezing I get an alert via a [custom smart home monitor rule](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/205380154-SmartThings-Home-Monitor) that I set up in the ST app. If the power fails I will get an alert from the [Device Monitor](https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-device-monitor-get-notified-if-devices-stop-reporting/41141) smart app. I also cut the sensor wire and soldered it to a small strip of IDE ribbon cable to keep it this where the door closes. The round wire would leave a gap and I worried about it breaking the seal and loosing precious cold. This is the best part!! The ESP8266 board is housed inside a Bob Ross (Altoids size) tin! I was going to custom 3d print a case, but when I saw Bob I knew this is the way to go, I mean just look at that face.  :D

This was my very first Arduino project and I'm super happy with the result. Wanted to share in case someone else out there is searching for a similar solution. By the way, ST\_Anything supports a wide variety of sensor types, not just temp. If you are inclined, check it out.

Oh!!! One last thing!!! If you try this. Once you have everything set up, and if its not updating on the ST app. Restart your ST hub. Like, a hard reset. Unplug it and wait 30 seconds.

Cheers! Happy Automating.

ccta4p,1563045759,The actual differences between Lutron lines,"Iâm shopping for smart switches and dimmers, and after browsing around a bit it feels like at least at levels beneath Homeworkâs QS, itâs largely artificial price discrimination in the economic sense, so please correct me if Iâm wrong.

What I mean: the CasÃ©ta and the RadioRA2 dimmers seem to use largely similar technology behind the scenes, with slightly âclassierâ outward-facing buttons (and âdesignerâ options) in the latter set. The RadioRA2 devices are hard to find pricing for online but seem to generally be around twice as much as the CasÃ©ta ones, and the other major difference is the number of devices supported, which is a pure software cap that they just raised retroactively for all CasÃ©ta users recently anyway. This all seems to suggest that apart from a few cosmetic differences and options, and removal of some artificial limitations, the RadioRA2 range exists primarily to tap into higher-end homeowners who want âthe fancy stuffâ and are willing to pay more for it. It wouldnât surprise me if the underlying electronics were nearly identical to simplify manufacturing.

Am I wrong? Are the RadioRA2 devices somehow fundamentally better?

ccu1rk,1563049689,What should I do with all these Honeywell devices in my new house?,"I'm new to the home automation game, but comfortable with diy electronics (assume I have all the enthusiasm and none of the knowledge). I would really love to have a slick, central setup utilizing something like Home Assistant and a suite of sensors. 

We just bought a new build house that came with:

* 2x Honeywell RTH6580 wi-fi thermostats (upstairs, downstairs) - $100 ea
* 1x Honeywell RTH7600D basic programmable thermostat (master bedroom) - $50
* 1x Honeywell Lyric Controller hub touchpad - zwave, wi-fi, camera, etc - \[not installed yet\] - $275
* 1x Honeywell SiXPIR LMD500 motion detector \[not installed yet\] - $50
* 2x Honeywell SiXMINICT door/windows sensors \[not installed yet\] - $35 ea
* 1x NEST video doorbell - currently bricked, need to get replacement
* 1x Kwikset Zwave deadbolt on front door
* 1x LiftMaster wi-fi enabled garage door opener
* 2x RF light switches
* 2x pre-wired with CAT5 for front/rear exterior cameras (but no cameras)

Already had:

* Google home speaker/mic
* Xiamoi Mi Robot vacuum (wifi enabled)

&amp;#x200B;

Suggestions? 

Should I go ahead and install everything? Sell them and buy better? 

Stick with Zwave, switch to Zigbee? Doesn't matter? I'd much rather have local control than cloud-based devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get the logic behind putting the cheapest, basic thermostat in the master. I'm thinking about getting an EcoBee instead there.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I utilize this Lyric hub and still run something custom like Home Assistant somewhere? Or is that redundant? Sell that and swap to a wall mounted tablet with a zwave stick?

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot to learn in this space, and I'm just starting. I'd really appreciate any and all suggestions for a well-rounded, low to moderate level of complexity, secure, encompassing system. I'm willing to spend some money to get there and get the house running smoothly.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a Smartthings V3 and a smart switch (the switch is a lowes iris brand).  I want this switch to send me a notification when it draws power and when it shuts off.  

&amp;#x200B;

Seems simple.  However, there a few gotchas.  The switch rarely shows that it is truly drawing zero watts, which is strange because the sump pump is either on or off.  And I don't seem to see an automation for simple, whatever is plugged into this switch is drawing power (yes/no).

&amp;#x200B;

So to improvise, I tried to setup a rule.  If the pump is less or equal to .05, send me a notification.  The problem here is that I receive a notification if its .05, or .04, or .03 and then back to .04... same thing goes for greater than 500 (sump pump is in operation.)

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally what I would have set up is if the pump turns on, send me a notification. When it turns off, send me a notification. However, I can't get this piece of automation to work either.  Hell, i'd even settle for a greater or less than rule if I could snooze the amount of notifications I receive in a space of ten minutes.  I dont need 20 notifications in 20 seconds.  I just need one.

In most cases I will be operating everything on Zwave or Ethernet (with a few exceptions for wifi).

Checklist:
- Ethernet to all rooms in house (with a few specific lines for indoor security camera placement)
- Ethernet to key locations on outside walls for security cameras
- speaker wiring to locations in house where I want speakers... I'll have these run back to a central control where I can plug into... I will likely be using Chromecast Audio to hook into the speakers (I know they are discontinued, I already have them)
- I'm going to buy a box of Zwave plus light and fan switches for the electrician to wire on all switches in the house (with the exception of closets and bathrooms... On those I will just do cheaper motion sensing switches since they work great for that purpose)
- putting plugs on the bottoms of cabinets so I can run LED light strips for accent/night lights

Is there anything else I should make sure I have now so I don't have to redo something later?  Thanks for any opinions!

* I would like something that will create it's own pattern or map so that it cleans all areas of the floor and doesn't go over one area multiple times, while missing other areas.

    - If fan does not automatically show up in home app under âAdd Deviceâ - âPair Manuallyâ then you need to  reset the fans WiFi module. 

To do so: 
- Power cycle fan at breaker or switch 
- Using the remote that came with the fan, take off the rear battery cover (will need tiny philips screwdriver) and hold down the pair button until you hear 3 beeps indicating it reset successfully. 

2.  Now open up your WiFi settings, if on the iPhone. You should see the fan name pop up with an option to connect it to your network right below the WiFi networks list. 

3.  Select the the fan name, it will be âSimpleconnectâ something, then say OK to the prompts and it should fill in your password and automatically connect to your selected network.

4.  Open Appleâs home app and select the room you want to add the fan to.  From that room select  âAdd deviceâ then âtype in code manuallyâ. 
    - You can either get the code from the fan itself, or take the battery compartment cover off of the remote there is code inside there as well. 

5.  Simply type in the 8 digit HomeKit code and follow the prompts from there to give it a name and set up other settings and you should be all set!

Note: 
Resetting The Wi-Fi module using the remote can sometimes cause the remote itself to un-pair. 

-  To re-pair the remote simply power cycle the fan again and quickly press the pair button on the back of the remote just once within 3mins.  

-  If youâve done it correctly you should hear a single beep indicating it was paired successfully.  If you here 3 beeps, it was not paired and you should repeat these steps.",MrQuez90,/r/homeautomation/comments/cddeh6/how_to_properly_connect_hunter_symphony_smart_fan/,3,homeautomation,1

I'm aware I'm not going to get any night vision stuff working indoors as the IR will bounce off the glass.

Powered is simply because it can be, being indoors, thus, no issue with charging or batteries.

The key thing, though, is to be able to stream to a local server once being triggered by motion.  I don't want to have to pull out an SD card every time I want to see what's happened - just transmit it straight through my network to a fileserver (probably with an SD card buffer, but still, no need to take it out).

Notification of triggering would be nice (via phone or email or whatever) but not completely necessary.  I could easily rig something up to monitor the destination drive on the server to alert me myself for new footage.

Distance between the camera location and birdfeeder is about 4 feet, just with a double glazed window in the way.  I don't need a wide FOV either given that.

Also - UK, but that shouldn't make too much difference as most of the models I've seen seem to be global (aka Chinese) anyway.

cditic,1563204305,Question about Smart Switch Compatibility/Installation,"So, I recently bought a new house, and I'd like to make it into a smart house. One of the first things I want to do is replace most of the light switches with smart switches. I found some good deals on Amazon, but before I pull the trigger, I want to make sure they're compatible with my home. (I plan on getting the Kasa TP-Link brand switches, if that helps at all.)

I opened the faceplate on a couple of them (after cutting the power at the breaker and testing it with a power tester, of course), but I didn't see what was described in guides I found online. At least one had two black wires and a white wire attached to the switch. There were also a bunch of wires stuffed behind it that seem unused, including a red wire and two thick white wires nutted together.

I'm aware that I need three wires for the smart switches to work: hot, neutral, and ground, and not all of them have a ground, but I'm having a tough time identifying what I have. My house was built in the 80's, so maybe the wiring is dated.

What should I do here? Should I hire an electrician to look at it? How much would that cost me? If the wiring isn't compatible, could he make it so, and if so, how much would that cost?

Another question is about installation. I would prefer to do it myself to save money, and have no qualms doing so, so long as I have clear instructions, but with the seemingly strange wiring in my house, I'm afraid I might start an electrical fire, which is the last thing I want. Getting a professional to do it would give me peace of mind, but I don't want this to get expensive. How much would it cost to hire someone, and is it worth it?

I hope I'm not asking something that's already been answered, but if so, pointing me to the right resources would be appreciated. Thanks!",PunctualGuy,/r/smarthome/comments/cditic/question_about_smart_switch/,6,smarthome,10

cdjhfl,1563207484,Controlling a light with both a smart light socket and the normal wall power switch.,"I have this annoying setup in my bedroom, where the light switch is next to the door, but there isn't a 2nd switch next to the bed. I'd like to be able to :  


* Turn off the light remotely from my bed before going to sleep.
* Turn on the light using the wall switch when getting back home.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any simple and cheap setup that will allow me to do this? I considered getting a smart light bulb socket (either with a remote or an app), but I couldn't find any information on being able to ""override"" the state that was selected remotely.   
Ideally I'd like something that will ""reset"" whenever it loses power. So that when I get back home, even though the remote/app set the smart light socket to ""off"", I could just ""off-on"" the wall switch and the light will turn on.  
This could be normal behavior on most smart light sockets for all I know, I just can't confirm it.  


A couple of things to note:  
1. Making any permanent changes isn't an option, as I do not own the apartment.  
2. I'd much rather use a smart light socket than a smart light bulb, seems more cost effective and I can keep using the same bulbs I'm used to.

I want to transition off Wi-Fi to local communication (both to reduce the load on my network and also for privacy/security). To achieve this I plan to get a smartthings hub which I understand supports zwave and zigbee. I then was planning on using ge zwave switches everywhere; however I encountered the following problems:

The problem on the first floor is that I have an older house and while my 3 dimmers all have neutral cables, the rest do not.  

The problem on the second floor is that all of the bedrooms have a fan/light combo (currently wired to a dumb remote control). 

Basically I want to know what my best options are for getting an older house on local communications where I can program routines and ask Alexa to turn lights off and on. Specifically my questions:

1) is Samsung smartthings hub the best hub option for me? Stick to zwave and zigbee?

2) for no neutral regular wall switches, I have only found one option: the $80 Lutron (pd-5ws-dv-wh). This isnât even on zwave or zigbee but some other communication that requires itâs own hub (ugh). Is there another option?

3) I have not found anything that works for a combo fan (3 speed) and light w dimmer. Is anyone familiar with an option for this?

Bonus questions:

A) are there any security cameras that record to a local hard drive using zwave or zigbee or something other than Wi-Fi? Ideally with the footage available real time on my cell phone. 

B) automated blinds / shades that work on zwave/zigbee.

cdmmms,1563220900,ISO recommendations for a smart switch or combination of smart switches,"Hi all,

Since it's prime day I'm looking to amp up my home automation. I have a tiny house  airbnb and would like to automate some functions that currently require human input, mainly for when the unit is not occupied by guests. Ideally I'd do this all with one in wall switch but I'm having a hard time sifting through the hundreds of options available to find what I need. If a single switch won't do, I'm absolutely open to multiple units that do different things. I want to avoid plugs that go into the socket because airbnb guests are notorious for disconnecting  these (I have a wifi extender and half the time they unplug that too). Ideally all of these would be controllable by IFTTT in addition to their native app and not require a hub. Last requirement is that I don't want things that have a built in Alexa or Echo as some guests feel like these can be used as covert listening devices and I don't want to annoy people. 

1. I'd like an in wall switch that can turn on/off my water heater. Right now it's connected to a traditional ""flippable"" light switch. I like the visual of the switch being up or down for on/off since the water heater itself isn't visible. So if the only option is one of those flat light switches, I'd like it to have a visual component to illustrate its status.
2. I'd like a switch that has a room thermostat sensor in. For periods when the tiny house is unoccupied I would like to turn on the heat or AC only when indoor temperatures reach a certain threshold. I don't have central ac/heat so things like the ecobee that are used with its own wall thermostat won't work. 
3. I'm also looking for recommendations regarding space heaters that don't pull a ton of wattage  (small is okay, the space is 127 sq feet) that will turn back on and run when power is restored via a smart switch. Everything I seem to find will turn back on in ""idle"" more and requires a manual button press to actually turn them back on.
4. Finally, the easiest component would be an in wall smart outlet that I can connect my window ac unit/ heater to and trigger power to when certain temperature thresholds are met.  

Bonus points: the recommended outlet that performs one/some of these functions also has a built in nightlight that is programmable or sensitive to ambient light. 

Does anyone have any recommendations?

  What I'd like to do, is control a few different sets of RGB strips around the home.
  I don't want to use anything which requires Alexa, Google, or similar. Local subnet only.

In the simplest terms, I'd like to have each section be able to receive a simple message, literally as simple as ""128 56 239"" to set a colour value.  
That would hopefully give me the building blocks to start building a control system somewhere in the house, which could then easily send commands to a certain room.

I found a couple of projects involving raspi control, is that likely to be the easiest method? Even if it's something lazy like running a script over ssh with the colour parameters. Thinking a little about power consumption, is it arduinoable?

Have I just picked up the wrong end of the stick entirely? Or is my simple plan reasonably achievable? Is there an existing product that I'd be better off working with, rather than reinventing the wheel?

I used to work in IT and have already gathered the supplies I need to fully wire the house with Cat6, with multiple ports in many of the rooms and two physically separate wireless access points (for household and guest use). I can readily create a virtual wifi network for HA gear as well. 

Currently, I already have a Linux based SAMBA server for our media collection. I am looking to add some HA functionality to that server. The goal is to reduce the amount of physical interaction my child needs to control his environment. (turn on lights, power up his gaming systems, powered doors controlled by RFIB fob etc) A secondary goal is to automate as much of the daily and weekly chores as possible to reduce the work load on my spouse and I so that we are more free to assist my child. 

So long term goals are robotic vacuum and mop, sprinkler system and robotic mower. 

Thing is, I am a major data privacy nut and there is no way I am willing to have data harvested by Apple or Google. (especially since I am protecting the privacy of a disabled minor) Every thing will hopefully be controlled using a web access portal hosted on my existing SAMBA machine. As far as I know, no one has a voice recognition HA system that doesn't require an always on connection to a ""mothership"" somewhere. 

So my questions are:

1) What sort of things can currently be done with my proposed set up?

2) Of the current standards, (zigbee, zwave etc) which are known for playing well with Linux? (I can easily spool up a Win10 virtual machine if I have to, but would prefer not to)

3) Some vacuums have their own web access hosted on a local device. Has anyone successfully unified that with an over all web access portal? I could have my web portal include a hyperlink to the OEM portal, but my web coding skills are minimal. My goal would be to find that someone else has made a web portal that accesses the vacuums API and then follow that like a recipe in my own set up.",barbarian818,/r/smarthome/comments/cdqoew/noninternet_smart_home_stuff_for_a_new_build/,6,smarthome,9

Ring Alarm

Wink

Schlage Locks (linked to Ring)

Alexa

Nest Thermostat

I have my locks linked to Ring so that the locks can arms/disarm the system. However, this forces me to have to use Alexa to create routines. It doesn't look like it is set up and is compatible with the locks (through Ring) or the Ring Alarm to create any routines.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the routines I'd like to create:

1. When I arm the system (whether it be from locking my front doors when leaving, arming via Alexa, or manually arming it via the keypad) I'd like all of the doors to automatically lock. I'd even be happy if one door locked the other would automatically lock too.
2. Right now I have 2 separate Kick-off's for Alexa: One to arm the system and the other to turn off the lights and lock the doors. I'd like to have one Routine where I say ""Good Night"" and it will Arm the system, turn off the lights and lock the doors. 
3. When the Ring Alarm System is armed away - the Nest system goes into ""Away"" mode or turns the A/C or Heat to a specific temperature. 

Is there any way to create those two routines with the setup that I currently have? Keeping my locks linked to Ring to arm/disarm the system is a must - so I can't unlink that.

I currently have 2 Google Home Minis, and a Trane thermostat that can be controlled through Nexia (currently on wifi, but supports zwave).

The easiest route would be to get something like a Samsung Smartthings. But I'm also considering getting a Pi (probably a 4) and a more hands on approach, but if I do this I'm confused as to where to start. I see a lot of things mentioned that I'm not sure what they are. Some things I see mentioned a lot: Home Assistant, hass.io, Node Red, MQTT, and a few others I can't think of off the top of my head.

I do want to try to run as many things locally as I can, and I've read that Smartthings can do some things locally, but not everything. But then again, I don't really plan on doing anything crazy, so maybe it would be best to start more simple and change over later if I need to.

I think I want to start just by getting a hub up and running. I have some existing automations through the ""routines"" page of my Google Home app, and a few things setup with IFTTT (adjusting thermostat based on a vacation being entered in Google Calendar for example), so I'd start off just by getting those converted over to be controlled by the hub.

ce028u,1563297720,Caseta Fan Controller w/ Smart Light,"I have a ceiling fan, it is very high (connects to the ceiling at 22 feet, fan hangs at 15ish feet) and I don't have a ladder or the knowledge to take apart the fan to see the wiring. The fan and light are on a single light switch with the fan functionality being controlled by a remote control. I don't like this.

I was thinking of getting a Caseta fan controller. I'm under the impression that if you do this, you need a Caseta fan controller for the fan, and a whatever switch for the light in the fan. Thus requiring double-gang for a single device. I don't like this, either.

Can someone tell me if this is feasible - and feasible without me having to touch the wiring on the fan-side (thus, only needing to touch the wiring on the switch side):

I want to buy a single Caseta fan controller. I want the Caseta switch to control the fan and fan speed. I then want to make it so the light is ""always on"" from the switch's perspective, but I'd put a smart bulb in the fan -- then I could control the smart bulb however I want (if I want the bulb off, use the app -- or use an adjacent switch that controls other lights in that room to IFTTT the smart bulb, etc.)

I'm pretty sure this is the wiring diagram for my fan, thought I don't remember if this is the exact model.

The A/C is a single whole home zone (the living/dining/kitchen thermostat has a manual heat/cool switch).

Thus far, all I can come up with is individual smart home thermostats where one is designated as the primary controller and when it switches from heat to cool, then they all switch (and of course, the âheat onlyâ zones would be controlling nothing when in the cool mode).

ce57vl,1563321756,Building a new beach house,"Hello everyone! My family is demolishing our beach house only to build a new one that is more suitable to use in winter since we want to spend more time there. We already have most of the house designed except maybe the electrical system and wiring. My father wanted a cheap way of automating the house and I figured it could be a nice project for both of us. I think if only the lights are automated would be perfect.

My best guess of how we could do this is the wiring diagram attached. Basically since I want to control the lights I buy an Arduino Mega (Lots of I/O ports) and connect a relay board to the arduino so I can connect or disconnect the neutral wire to each light. To save ports I can do a button matrix (like the ones found in keypads) for the input signal of push buttons distributed in the house. For the buttons this would need two conductors each.  This way I can switch lights either with the pushbutton on the wall or via the app. Also, the app can be configured to have timers set up and later I can add for example a light sensor to the arduino and detect when is dark, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

For the software I would install Blynk, since it has an easily configurable app and not so complicated coding (I'm a Mechanical engineer with not so much knowledge of coding, only the basics)

So, my questions are:

\- Is there something you think I have thought wrong?

\- What problems do you think I could encounter while trying to set this up?

\- How do you think I could integrate light dimming into this setup?

\- Do you know where can I get good looking push buttons for the wall so my mom doesn't complain it looks horrible? (Stores in the US or maybe a chinese web store)

\- Do you think the server provided by Blynk is good enough? Or maybe I should buy a raspberry pi and have a local server?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for every bit of help you can provide me!

Looking for generic feedback,"Own a small MSP - we have referred out a lot of business (I mean a lot, close to 1M in revenue over 18 months) contacts for commercial and residential AV. I couldn't get Control4 to respond to my three dealer app requests so we became an RTI dealer this past week.

I know every system has it's pit falls in different areas - but figured with a couple projects insight/ lined up that the business venture was worth a stab and if it leads to other control system opportunities and expansion, so be it!

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience with RTI on the user or installer side? Curious of some opinions. I have heard good things but realize the platform is a bit limited in some regard compared to C4, savant, crestron, etc. The cool thing is if you can code, a device can be IP or serial controlled, RTI has a platform to make it happen. My fear is that the processing capabilities are limited (hardware wise), and right off the bat their intercom system is not where near as good as Control4 - which isn't saying much as it is. They also don't have wireless keypads/ tablets like C4 - but they do have a andorid/ ios support which is customizable unlike C4 (more like Crestron).

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight is appreciated. We are going to have a few people go through training and do two projects before investing more into the platform.

cee5b6,1563376371,Seems like Alexa is better at controlling/grouping lights than Google Home. Thoughts?,"I have a a bunch of smart bulbs (Philips Hue and some third party Cree bulbs) and also a TP Link Smart plug. All run through the Philips Hue Bridge hub.

&amp;#x200B;

I use an Amazon Echo 2nd generation, and it recognizes all of my smart devices and I can easily make many different groups. I can put all my kitchen bulbs into one group and call it ""Kitchen"", and also put all the kitchen bulbs along with a hallway and bathroom bulb into another group and call it ""Downstairs"" It's great, because I can overlap devices, putting the same one into multiple groups.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got a Google Home Nest, because it was cheap enough and I wanted to see what it's like (I use Google Assistant on my phone a lot). But when I went to configure all my smart bulbs and plug, it seemed like I could only put one device into one ""Room"", as Google calls it. So, for instance, I could put my kitchen bulbs in a room called ""Kitchen"", but then I couldn't put them in another room called ""Downstairs"". In other words, as far as I could tell, you can only have a device under one ""Room"" at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

I read about a workaround - adding a keyword to the device names. So I added a ""downstairs"" tag to all of my downstairs bulbs. Then kitchen bulbs were renamed ""Kitchen 1 downstairs"" and ""Kitchen 2 downstairs"", along with ""Bathroom downstairs"" and ""Hallway downstairs"". That way, if I said ""turn off all downstairs lights"", it would turn off all lights with the ""downstairs"" tag in their name. Great! So then grouped all of my lights into their rooms. Now I could turn off all bulbs with the same tag at the end of their names, or turn them off by rooms.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this only worked for the Cree bulbs. If I added a ""downstairs"" tag to my Philips bulbs, when I asked Google to turn all downstairs lights off, it would ignore the Philips ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I ended up returning the Google Home Next. Alexa seemed so much easier with it's ""Groups"" set up. Am I missing something? Was I not setting up the Rooms properly on Google Home? Or is Alexa indeed easier to use when it comes to controlling the lights? What are your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Alexa allows me to add the same bulb/device to multiple Groups. I can have my kitchen bulbs in the Kitchen Group and also the Downstairs Group. With Google Home I could not.

[This is the thermostat I have](https://www.trane.com/residential/en/products/thermostats-and-controls/comfortlink-xl850/). It's a Trane ComfortLink II XL850. I found it [listed on the Z Wave Alliance site](https://products.z-wavealliance.org/products/1139) as well. It has a [Nexia bridge](https://www.nexiahome.com/certified-products/trane-xl824-control) built in.

I hate this thermostat. It doesn't accurately measure the air temperature while the AC is running. If the AC is not running, it operates fine. Sometimes, the AC runs and runs and the measured air temperature will actually increase even though we can feel it getting cooler. This is very inconsistent though and doesn't happen all the time. It's weird. If you Google it, you'll find others with the same issue. My personal theory is that the heat generated from the wifi chip in the thermostat is interfering with the temperature sensor.

I could just turn off the wifi, and use the programmable schedules, but we have a few uses for it. My wife's favorite is the ability to say ""Okay Google. It's nap time."" This lowers the AC temperature and then 2 hours later has it resume it's normal schedule. Then it starts playing white noise on the Google Home in the bedroom. We have a 2 year old and it's easier for my wife to just say this than it is to adjust the temperature, and then adjust it back. And we can't put it in the schedule, because he doesn't always take a nap at the same time.

I'm considering getting a Hubitat to start expanding some other automations. I believe this thermostat has a Z Wave radio in it. If possible, I want to disable the wifi and then control it through a hub using Zwave. Then I'd change my current automations (which run in a combination of Nexia and IFTTT) to run from the hub instead. Or maybe not, I dunno. I'm mainly looking for a way to get the thermostat off my wifi.

I also want to get LED strips for a game room set up that I can match to my PC setup and for behind the TV in the living room. I want to be able to control them wirelessly either through Google home or via a third party app. 

Are there any other smart devices you would recommend other than lights and security items? I've been seeing reference to ZigBee and Zwave but when I search for those they seem like a platform that other things run on (similar to Google home or Amazon Alexa) rather than actual products. Some clarification here would be awesome.

ceh867,1563390319,How can a RF signal get stuck in a Sonoff RF?,"I believe what I witnessed was a bug in ESPurna but wanted to see whether someone may have had the same issue.

I have a couple of RF wall switches which send an RF message, which gets intercepted by a Sonoff RF Bridge, which in turn sends the message to a MQTT bus. This message is then consumed by Home Assistant to send an MQTT message to a WiFi switch, which (almost there) switches on/off a lamp.

All this works for a few months.

Today I witnessed a strange behaviour.

About half o the wall switches did not work. There are numerous reasons why they may not work (weak signal, problems with the RF bridge, problems with the MQTT, ...). I connected to my RF bridge web interface and monitored in the debug window what it was receiving. 

It was seeing the messages from some switches and from some not.

Rebooted it, same thing. Moved it somewhere else (next to the not working switches), same thing.

The tension the house is raising together with the sun setting so I grabbed my redundant RF bridge and plugged it in. Connected to its web interface, debug window and here I see a bunch of RF messages flowing in. Nothing in the house is sending them.

I then went to the non-working switches and, lo and behold, they work.

Disconnected the second bridge, they still work. This second bridge is not configured in HA so whatever it does cannot have an impact at that level)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a had time understanding what happened -- it looks like the fact of merely switching in a second RF bridge ""unstuck"" the first one (which somehow  spew back all the messages it received so far (I think) - something it is not supposed to do).

Everything is back to normal but I am puzzled.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is whether someone has ever witnessed such a behaviour?** 

I will continue monitoring and raise a bug with ESPurna but probably without tangible evidence of the firmware failing (I do not see any other way for what happened to happen).",WoJWoJWoJ,/r/homeautomation/comments/ceh867/how_can_a_rf_signal_get_stuck_in_a_sonoff_rf/,4,homeautomation,3

Based on my limited understanding, it seems that I could put those two doors in a second partition and observe status without requiring that they be closed when I arm partition 1.

My questions:

* Where do I find documentation for multiple partitions?
* I'd like to add WiFi garage door controllers, but haven't selected a system yet. With the EVL-4EZR module, is there a system that will let the door sensors perform double duty? (Job 1 = connected to alarm system, Job 2 = connected to garage door controller.)

I have no background in electrical engineering so everything Ive learned is just through this reddit - so bear with me! :)

1. I put a screw driver on those two pins together and they triggered the buzzer, so i was thinking if the relay could send a current to these pins, it would trigger the buzzer.

ceuvau,1563468003,What's a good Android app for controlling mainly smart lights and outlets?,"So my set up right now is that I have a Philips hue bridge, four Philips smart bulbs, a few third-party bulbs (Cree brand), and one TP Link smart plug. All of the lights go through the Hue bridge (unfortunately it doesn't recognize the TP Link smart plug).

I then have Philips hue bridge and the TP Link smart plug linked to and Amazon Echo for full voice command.

It works great when I use voice commands around the house, however if I want to bring up the controls on my phone, I would like things to be more streamlined.

To control things from my phone, I can open the Philips Hue app. But the Hue app doesn't handle Rooms/Groups very well. You can only have a device in one ""Room"", meaning that I can have a light named Kitchen Light in a ""Kitchen Room"" or a ""Downstairs Room"", but not both. Plus the Hue app doesn't recognize the TP Link plug.

The Alexa app is better because I can make as many ""Groups"" as I want, and have the same light in multiple groups. However, the apps interface isn't that great. After opening, you need to navigate to a separate tab, and there you can only see the groups you created with only on/off buttons. You have to dig a little further to get full control over individual lights.

Also but the Hue app and Alexa don't have great widgets.

So I'm looking for an app that can integrate all of my lights and plugs, that has a nice interface that's easy to use, and preferably includes some nice widgets.

Any suggestions?

Here are some limitations/question:

Does this work without WiFi? We don't have wifi in the unit. If really necessary I could ask a neighbor if we can use their WiFi 

Does this work with Google home? We don't have any smart home devices in the apartment but we use Google at home.and when we sell I could take the lock for our house, and I'd like it to sync with Google Home. (I think I need to put the wifi bridge, which I could do later)

The keypad is a ATT-SW-PAD2W and I believe that there is a controller somewhere as well, but a slew of events have kept me from being able to fully investigate where the controller might be (just moved, having demolition done, and had a medical emergency).  I also ripped off one of the sensors, which was a 5816 belonging to this family of devices: [http://library.ademconet.com/MWT/fs2/5816/5800-Wireless-Transmitters-Data-Sheet.PDF](http://library.ademconet.com/MWT/fs2/5816/5800-Wireless-Transmitters-Data-Sheet.PDF) which look like they operate on 345 MHz (RF?) using ASK which I am not familiar with.

However, I've seen people have success with swapping one of the three ways in the circuit and things work fine (I have several 3 ways that's I've changed just a single HS210 with and it works fine).

However, with the four way, here's my setup:

Switch 1 - 4 way
Switch 2 - 3 way
Switch 3 - 4 way
Switch 4 - 3 way

I've replaced *Switch 2* with the HS210. Everything works fine... _except_ the switch status. That means, the switch toggles the lights on/off and other switches in the circuit work just fine.

However, the app doesn't report the status properly, nor does the switch itself (the white ring is always on). I can press the power button in the app and it'll eventually toggle the switch (it takes several taps).

*The oddity...* is that if I change the other three way (*Switch 4*) with the HS210 the status is reported correctly. I *did not* link the switches via the app. I tried changing just *Switch 4* (so replaced the original switch in *Switch 2*), but the status issue remains.

So, how is it that the switches know the status when both are in use yet can't determine status if only one is in use? I'd really like to only replace the single switch so I have the other to use on another fixture, if possible.

In the living room closet, among many other devices and cables, there is a B&amp;K 310 3-zone receiver/amplifier that seems to be connected to 3 in-wall control panels (B&amp;K CK1.2) in various areas of the house via cat5e and speakers in those areas via speaker wire in the walls. The wall control panels have 2 options programmed: CD and radio. The radio option works fine and the stations can be adjusted from the control panel. I haven't tried the CD option, but I'm sure it would work fine. Since I don't really own or listen to CDs anymore, I'm wondering if it might be possible to somehow adapt this system to stream music from online sources or my personal digital collection? My ideal situation would be to stream music from Pandora/Spotify/something and my digital music library to the speakers in any area, controlling it from either a phone/tablet or a wall panel in that area. Does any know of any device that can make this happen? I'm thinking there might be some kind of streaming device that can be connected to the receiver in the closet as an additional audio source. It looks like the CD player is controlled by an IR signal put out but the receiver, controlled by the wall panels. I'm wondering if it might be possible to do the same for some sort of streaming device? Of course, I'm not sure how I would go about reprogramming the wall panels and it seems the B&amp;K company is now defunct, so I'm not gonna get any support there. I'm willing to spend some money to replace the components with newer ones if needed to make this work, but I'd prefer to stick with wired over wireless as I like the reliability.

Which is fine, but inevitably the switch gets turned off at some point, and rendering the Hue lights useless for voice activation.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if it makes sense to put a smart switch in the bathroom to control the Hue lights. That way we can always use voice control for the bathroom and not have to worry about the switch being off. I want to keep the Hue lights because I like the ability to be able to change the temperature of the lights.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if I did this, how would I sort out the naming convention for the lights and switch? Right now the three Hue lights are named Bathroom 1, Bathroom 2, Bathroom 3, and they are also in a group named ""Bathroom"". If I put a smart switch in, I would name that simply ""Bathroom"", so that all three Hue lights come on, but then I have to name/group the bulbs something different.

&amp;#x200B;

Or is there a way to set it up so that regardless of what I name the switch, when the Hue lights that are linked to the switch are activated, it automatically turns on the switch too?

I was able to get the sensor reset after altering the directions from the scanned PDF. Opening the sensor to wake it appears to be where my issues was. Instead of doing that I ""open"" the contact with the magnet to wake it, waited a few seconds, and then proceeded to ""open"" and ""close"" the contact 10 times in less than 10 seconds.

cfth07,1563671955,automatic window opener - double hung window," 

Hello community, I need your help.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been actively searching for an automatic window (because why not in short.. if you wanna hear why, the window is heavy and my desk is blocking the easy access from the window. I do not wish to move the desk.)

So, here is my current window.

[https://imgur.com/EPATx8d](https://imgur.com/EPATx8d)

(don't worry about the broken glass, it is fixed and cleaned)

I've been searching for the automatic window opener that are on the markets, they easily go for over $250+

which is [https://imgur.com/vMMt6Y4](https://imgur.com/vMMt6Y4)

so I did some search where I can do the same thing but cheaper options.

1. option #1 : install an overhead electric hoist. at amazon, there is one with $100. so I was thinking to install that right between the window sides (or sill) just beneath the top plate. [https://imgur.com/JcGEn6o](https://imgur.com/JcGEn6o) I guess this can be hooked under the handle which has about 3.5"" space left from the bottom window plate.
2. option #2: buy an automatic lift jack. it starts at $75. The only problem is that the lift jack's lowest height is 4.1"" but I only have 3.5 inch clearance. [https://imgur.com/ySSDLaY](https://imgur.com/ySSDLaY)
3. I've been searching for DIY sort of, starting with Stepper motor with chain or rail that somehow lift the window. I have zero knowledge on designing electricity and circuit that allow me to control the motor automatic. (really need help on this one.) cheapest option yet, but I really need to study hard

[https://imgur.com/2CXYuE1](https://imgur.com/2CXYuE1) this is just for a reference and dimension.

&amp;#x200B;

I have advised use the linear actuator but I'm not sure how I can use that when I only have 3.5"" clearance between the handle and bottom window plate.

cfx2d9,1563699395,His and Hers Automatic Bed Lighting,"I stumbled across GLEDOPTO controllers some time ago and one of the projects I utilized them for was bed lighting using two connected LED strips under the frame of a king size sleigh bed. It worked off two motion sensors facing either side of the bed and kicked on lights whenever my wife or I stepped out of the bed at night or came into the room - quite useful for seeing your path without turning on full room lighting in the middle of the night. The whole thing only displayed one light color because it was just one controller, but it did the job and wowed all who saw it. Well, we moved and I had to take it all apart and I decided that when I rebuilt it, I'd rebuild it better...  


[Behold, bed lighting version 2.](https://imgur.com/a/ZZ7i4Z9)


This setup utilizes two [GLEDOPTO Zigbee controllers](https://www.amazon.com/K2-Home-Tech-Gledopto-Controller/dp/B07QBM2456) integrated with Philips Hue, so they appear in Hue as Hue Light Strips and all Hue functionality is available to utilize. The light strips themselves are [Supernight 5M RGBW strips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQHQJ5C/), powered by two [12V 5A power supplies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y64QLBM/). The Hue lights are integrated with Smartthings, and the lights are turned on and off via two [Iris 3326-L motion sensors](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lot-of-10-Iris-Motion-Sensor-3326-L/153437950990?epid=2256037145&amp;hash=item23b99d540e:g:jgcAAOSwvaBco724) that are devices within Smartthings (picked them up off cheap off eBay since Lowes no longer sells them). Alexa is integrated with Smartthings and allows for voice control of the colors and functionality too, and since the lights are part of the Hue platform, all the apps that integrate with Hue can operate the lights (color changing to screens, flashing to music, etc.). 


The way this works is fairly simple, but with a few moving parts... First, the lights are in Hue with their colors pre-set (for fun and simplicity, I named them ""Lady Lights"" and ""Dude Lights"" in Hue so I can call those names out to Alexa for color changes). My wife saved the pink color as a scene in Hue as well named Vaginga, so that she can call out ""Alexa! Turn on Vaginga"" and her side of the bed goes pink. We've got a lot of stuff like that... absolutely love Alexa's custom routines... Anyway, from there the motion sensors are set up independently via an individual Routine for each in Smartthings. Whenever motion is detected on either side, the motion sensor on that side turns on its corresponding light via the routine, so, for example, when the motion sensor on the guy's side is tripped, the blue lights come on. Another routine kicks in if no motion is sensed on either motion sensor for five minutes and turns them back off. I just found a SmartApp in the Smartthings Marketplace called ""Gentle Wake Up"" that is supposed to let you dim lights up or down and I've re-jiggered my turn off routine to utilize it and make it fade the lights out over the course of a minute after five minutes of no motion, but it's too early to tell if it's working as hoped. I keep leaving the room and forgetting to check on it and see if they're fading off, but the lights are out when I come back...


So, yeah, independent fun colored lighting for both sides of the bed - woot!


Total cost (minus existing infrastructure of Smartthings, Hue, Alexa, etc.): **$109**


* Controllers: $29 each - $58 total (actually got this for $23 on a Prime sale and already had the other but I'm counting the total current cost as if I'd started from scratch. They can also be had for pretty cheap on AliExpress too if you're willing to wait for shipping from China (make sure you get the 1D controller if you want it to show up right in Hue. Also, there's a GLEDOPTO 'Wireless' RGB+CCT controller available too and I have one. It works with Hue as well, but the color changes are...chunkier. The response time lags compared to the Zigbee, so go for the Zigbee.).
* RGBW LED Strips: $11 each - $22 total
* Power Supplies: $9 each - $18 total
* Iris Motion Sensors: Bought a lot of 10 on eBay for $55, so $5.50 each, $11 total.

cfx5k5,1563700240,My best options for smarts shutters,"Hi.
I have recently bought a condo that is being built currently.
I have 10 windows/door-windows. They are all electric each with its own switch on the wall.
I am interested to add automation mainly to avoid to go over each switch every night and every morning to close/open them.
I have few options but I am not sure which one is the best and so would like your opinion.

1. I have asked the electrician who offered a solution with a centralized button to open/close all the shutters. This solution comes also with a custom app from the vendor of the switches (feller). This solution would not be compatible with google home Alexa or anything like that. I will have to use the dedicated app.
Moreover it requires extra wiring for their bus system and the centralized button which I really donât need.
Price tag is quite steep. The equivalent of About 2000 USD (I live in Switzerland).

2. I add dedicated smart switches for each shutter later after condo is delivered. I think I can manage to do it myself.
I saw possible devices to use like Shelly 2.5. Or Sonoff or something similar 
But I am afraid that I will void warranty from the electrician right away. Which is my main concern. 

3. Ask the electrician to install a dedicated smart switches that I suggest. Here I think I might have hard time because electrician is quite strict with safety standards etc etc 
So he will want something with required certifications etc.
Obviously he wants to sell solution #1 

What do you think is the best option? What would you do?
I have a preference for #3 but I am not sure what kind of switch to suggest. I think the electrician will push back on Sonoff and Shelly because unknown brands
to him. 
Can you suggest some similar switches that might be easier do accept? For example from
Established brands?

cfxhd9,1563703406,Privacy-oriented home automation?,"Is it worth it doing something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/0EncQ3e.png)? Where you have one main computer / access point which connects to the internet, and all of your smart devices run on an intranet which makes them unable to communicate with anything outside of your home. The RT computer would then receive and send commands based on what peripherals running what I guess would have to be custom control apps send it, so that to the smart devices, the computer is the control point, not the peripherals. 

The main point in a setup like this would be to prevent the smart devices from contacting the outside world (and as such it would feature no assistants, which require internet connection). Why? Because I value privacy. FVEY is able to request lots of device manufacturers to outright give up their data or install backdoors onto these devices, at least if the companies are based in FVEY countries, and this surveillance majorly crosses over the FVEY border into almost all devices out there, AFAIK. This is more than slightly concerning (keep in mind this is from the mindset of a Linux user who uses DDG as their primary search engine and such) and would prefer privacy. The other major issue I have with Internet-connected smart devices is the vulnerabilities. Time and time again it has been shown how insecure IoT devices really are, and I wouldn't trust the manufacturers to fix every bug, ever, since that's just unrealistic. This would leave one vulnerable weak point in the system, the RT service which runs the whole house, which I can make and control to weed out vulnerabilities one at a time. 

It would be costly (in time and money) but I'm in need of a project anyways. Sorry for the shoddy diagram btw. What do you think? I really want to code my own master computer system now and it would get everything so neatly organized. Also are there any devices that don't require constant internet connection and only require wireless connection to a peripheral to function (I know Philips Hue at least doesn't need internet, only wireless connection). 

Also, I would probably selectively be able to open up internet traffic between certain devices and the Internet, such as my Smart TV. But only when I want to use it. There's no point in anything accessing the Internet without my explicit permission.

And while it has probably been done before a hundred times, I really want to code an app and a great control service for this thing. The RT probably only needs to be a raspi and a network switch to function properly, I didn't plan on setting up a whole homelab for this thing. I am the kind of guy who does things themselves, and I love feeling happy with knowing my system is as secure as it can be.

And also the FVEY thing isn't conspiracist rambling. Since the Snowden leaks it's been pretty clear they use IoT and websites to log private data on a very non-anonymous level.",JuhaJGam3R,/r/homeautomation/comments/cfxhd9/privacyoriented_home_automation/,0,homeautomation,12

I posted in r/Apple but I didnât get any responses so Iâm trying here. I have no idea what the old owners did with the speakers and how they had it set up, I suspect they had an av receiver to connect their tv/blu Ray/cable/other music systems into to output into these speakers. Iâm trying to figure out if an airplay 2 av receiver will even be necessary, what additional functionality will it give me. Our Apple TV will be plugged into it via hdmi, in theory, I feel like I can airplay to the Apple TV which the sound will come through the speakers anyways since the Apple TV will be connected to the receiver. I donât think Iâll need airplay 2 on the receiver because the Apple TV will route all sound through the hdmi anyways to the receiver. But Iâm having issues confirming this. I did find a website hours again that detailed out a very short list of particular reasons why I would find it useful versus a regular receiver. But of course I canât find it now. I definitely love the Apple ecosystem and see some notes of additional functionality with airplay2 and HomeKit but Iâm unable to clarify if these options would also work with the Apple TV  anyways. I did figure out that I canât set up multi room speakers without airplay 2, which to be honest is fine because it would involve moving a lot of wires behind the scenes anyways.

Alexa has been rather clunky with controlling my devices. It has difficulty understanding commands at times, and scheduled routines only work halfway. I'm thinking that introducing a hub to the equation will help smooth things out.

Recently I bought a robot vacuum and I'm absolutely astonished how easy it has made my life. I've also ordered a motion sensor water tap and thinking about expanding my range at home.

A nice way to control a few lights and be able to dim them would be the next step I think. Not all of them, however, I would prefer not to hire an electrician. Something that is easy to transfer from an apartment to another one or a house eventually. 

I like the idea of home automation but it seems fairly expensive at the moment, with not a whole lot of perks. Also there's the whole mess with all the different systems and apps that I would like to avoid as much as possible. I'm also concerned about energy costs. Also spending tons on light bulbs that have to be changed and entirely thrown away at some point seems wasteful to me. I would prefer just having to change the usual LED bulbs.

cg83xa,1563766537,Looking to step up my smart home game and collect data with a new hub,"Hello All, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been using several Smart Home devices for 2 years now and been enjoying it a lot. Although, I think jumping the gun to buy Smartthings at the beginning was a mistake. Here is what I don't like about it:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The app sucks. Not only that but now my phone forces me to have 2 smartthings apps installed and it has been this way for a loong time. 

\-I want to be able to log things on the long term such as temperature/humidity reported. No, I don't want to download it from ecobee's website every month manually. Ideally, I'd have my hub log them automatically, have a csv or google docs sheet with tens of thousands of lines (I think you can tell I""m a bit of a data nerd).

\-Door controls are terrible. This was a bit of a shocker to me when I first bought it I couldn't assign lock codes from my phone. I am aware of lock manager and I use it but it is very very janky, not a fan. Also, Smartthings' solution to assign locks doesn't work with my front door but assigns codes to side door just fine for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a list of devices I have:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Logitech Harmony

\-Z-wave switch

\-2 smart locks (1 zigbee, 1 z-wave)

\-Wi-fi switches

\-2x Google home

&amp;#x200B;

I am totally in for a open source solution but would preferably not build it from scratch with raspberry pi or something. Buying a box that has zigbee and zwave capabilities would be nice. I am comfortable adding command lines etc to make things work but not looking forward to deal with that sort of thing every day, looking for a somewhat refined solution.

cg8ds2,1563768271,Looking for Suggestions on Home Automation for someone with Disabilities.,"This is something we wanted to do for a long time and even recommended by our Occupational Therapist is to automate our home more for comforts. Sadly the OT said it's not covered... So in a few years hopefully we can put enough aside to make the home better.

My Spouse has a chronic pain disability with sadly a few extra's attached. She is bed ridden for most of her day and so we want to make her life better though it will have to wait as were on social assistance. I sadly quit work to provide full time for her needs. She did not enjoy the PSW's and they normally were not allowed to handle most of her needs. So finding say Cheaper Idea's like door bell button that is networked with say a cheap outdoor camera pointing down vs say something like Ring for costs.

We are looking for ideas and suggestions.

Things we always wanted:

* Door Camera / Bell system that can connect to a light to visually see if someone is at the door.
* Door Unlock system. She mostly can't ever answer the door and unlock it. If she could unlock the door for say the mailman that would be amazing.
* Light Switches &amp; Plugs to turn on and off lights automatic and other appliances she requires.
* Dimmer Light Switch that can be used on and off but also with sensors that would sense someone put the brightness if not already on to say 10-20% for when she does move. - She has light sensitivity and major brain fog and can't think well enough to say turn the light on or even dim it and ends up having a lot of falls.
* 4-6 Camera's around the outside of the home to allow her to be able to be part of the outdoors. - She really loves our home and outside but she can't really be part of it. Just getting her up to sit up and look out the window can be a lot of energy at times. Sometimes I go out with a Camera and bring it in for he but she like the ability to do it herself.
* Emergency Physical Button. Something we can put in a few locations, Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen for when she needs help. Also something that can send alert on the phone maybe even let her use a phone to also create said emergency button. I also would like to be able to link lights / sounds to such device so I can get on my phone, other rooms, etc. Sort of a half way to 911 Panic button.
* Some sort of easy to talk to system say Google Home where she can ask questions and have them answered back. Sometimes her brain fog really makes thinking hard on her so being able to ask some simple questions and have a device help her is something that would rock.


I really could go on like blinds, etc. I mean these are a lot of dream items and we want to start somewhere maybe say Panic System that can be linked to some sort hub and send even basic alert out for safety. Then maybe dimmer light switches with a sensor, etc. 

I really wish I could provide her more in this world. We already struggle with food and the basics. To give you an idea we Live in Canada and we can't even get her a powered wheel chair / scooter and does not fit the criteria. Things like Pain Management, Social usages, etc are not permitted and acceptable reasons. Because or home is too small because we could not afford something bigger we can't fit either devices in the home either to say we could use it the second she leaves her home. Right now she uses forearm crutches and like to when she can. Other time she uses me or she crawls yes an adult women 6 foot 1"" crawls to the bathroom...

Sorry for so much info a lot of us call us deadbeats and a drain on peoples money and keep asking us even in public why we stealing their money. For the longest time we were confused and then we put it together they meant taxes going to Social Assistance. 

Anyways we just want to get some idea's so we can make a list get some price idea's and start planning for our future.

Alternatively, is there any power strip that has the ability to dim? As far as I can tell the answer is no, but I figured I'd ask anyway. I am most likely going to pick up a Zooz power strip to be able to control my pumps so if I could all in one something that would be great.

cgdjsk,1563803957,Wanting to get started. Can someone help me figure out what I need to get to accomplish what I want?,"The first thing I want to do is setup controls for the lights and fan in the bedroom. I think what I want to do will make my wife appreciate what can be done with automation and remote/voice control. Here's our current setup.

#Wall Switch 1

We have a Harbor Breeze ceiling fan. It's not a smart fan, but is controlled via a RF remote. The wall switch literally just stays in the on position 100% of the time. The remote has speeds 1 - 6, plus a ""breeze"" setting that randomly varies the speed. You can turn the light on or off, or hold the light button down to dim the light. The switch for reversing the direction for winter is also on the remote. Literally every function of the fan/light is controlled by the remote.

#Wall Switch 2

Does nothing. I think it's wired for a traditional fan so that one switch can turn the light on/off and the other one turns the fan on/off. We are the ones that put the current fan into the bedroom, but we did it within the first couple of weeks of buying the house and I just can't remember if that's how it worked with the previous fan. Just to make sure, I have tested both the tops and bottoms of every outlet in the room. It does not control them.

#Wall Outlet

In the outlet behind the bed, there are two lamps plugged in. They are just small reading lamps with a toggle switch built into the cord. They are mounted onto the wall above the bed. One on my side, one on my wife's side. It's the kind that can be swiveled around and the beam is sorta focused. To be honest, we use this more than the overhead light. Most of the time we have these two lights pointed up towards the ceiling and out towards the middle of the room a bit. It lights up the room really well without having a light shining in your face.

#What I want to do

I have a Hubitat hub, which currently does nothing because I don't have anything to connect to it yet. I am literally just starting out.

First off, I know I will need something that can send RF signals to the fan. I am thinking of picking up a [Bond](https://bondhome.io/) for this, since it could also control the living room fan (another Harbor Breeze similar to the one in the bedroom, which actually has the same remote). Though I am open to other suggestions, because I would prefer something that is not wifi based. I'd rather it connect to my hub so the commands can be sent locally. Though, I am unsure if Bond relies on the cloud, or if the commands would just travel over my home network.

I want to replace Wall Switch 1 with a smart switch. This is the switch that just stays turned on 100% of the time. Is it possible to have a smart switch wired up so that the device it controls is always powered? We want to still be able to use the remote to turn the fan/light on. If it's toggled off, I just want it to send a command to the fan to turn the fan and light off. When it's toggled on, I want it to send a command to the fan to turn the light on and put the fan on speed 2.

I want to do something similar with Wall Switch 2. I want to put a smart switch in. I will get 2 smart plugs for the lamps. So when you toggle the switch on, the lamps come on and off turns them off.  I've seen that some (or all? I dunno) smart switches let you do things like double tap power on to do something different, so I'd set this one up to make a double tap of the power on turn on the lamps and the fan light. However, I'll need a way to turn them on/off from the bed as well, otherwise my wife will just use the switch on the cord to turn hers off and then the lamp won't have power; I've seen simple ""smart buttons"" that are just, well.... small buttons like a doorbell. I think one of these on each side of the bed would work to toggle the single light on and off. I think my wife would like this because it would let her hide the toggle switch on the lamp cord behind the bed's headboard.


Of course, there's more I want to do, but this is what I want to start with. I have only started looking at switches, and I gotta be honest it's a little overwhelming. I'm sure as I get into it more, I'll know what I'm looking for, but right now I'm sorta at a loss; there's just so many different options and I don't know which ones will do want I want.

Also, as a side note, I do not know if these particular wall switches have a neutral wire, but I suspect they probably do. I know the switches in my bathrooms do because I recently got a timer switch for my bathroom fans.",waterboysh,/r/homeautomation/comments/cgdjsk/wanting_to_get_started_can_someone_help_me_figure/,4,homeautomation,8

cgtuf7,1563894738,Samsung SmartThings - what are the widgets like?,"I have yet to find a good setup on Android phone (Galaxy S9) that nicely displays all my lights and their controls.

&amp;#x200B;

I am using a Philips Hue Bridge, along with 4 Hue lights. Connected to the Bridge, I also have some Cree lights. Not connected to the Bridge (because they aren't compatible) I had a few TP Link lights and 1 TP Link Smart Plug. I then have everything connected to my Echo.

&amp;#x200B;

With Alexa, I can voice-control everything fine. However, There are times where I'd rather just push a button on my phone to control a light. With the Philips Hue App, I can create widgets for Rooms &amp; Zones, but not individual lights. Which is sort of fine, because I can just make a Zone for each light if I want. But then the Zones don't work that great with Alexa (for example, if I have a light named Hall in the Hue app, then make a Zone called Hall, Alexa will list both the light and the Zone as separate devices. Then when I go to say ""Turn off Hall light"", it gets confused and says there are multiple devices with that name.).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the Hue widgets only let you turn a light/device on or off. You can't, for instance, click on the widget and go into the lights dimming/color controls.

&amp;#x200B;

So that brings me to the SmartThings hub. I've been thinking about getting one, as it's not super expensive. HOWEVER, I'd like to know what the functionality of the app is like. Are there widgets? Are the widgets any good? And how is the app design? With the Hue app, when I open it, it shows a list of my Rooms. I then have to click into a Room to see the status of the lights in said room.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone tell me what the SmartThings app (and widgets, if there are any) is like?

&amp;#x200B;

I first tried to search for a Universal Remote that could handle this but found that devices that ""learn"" RF are very limited.

I then tried a Broadlink RM Pro which allowed you add new devices and RF learning. It worked on the Fan but not on the Bed. I eventually found that the remote the bed has is utilizing 2.4Ghz RF which is  beyond the scope of the Broadlink device.

New to the forum, and getting into HA. Previously was an X10 guy way back in the day, but have been out of it for a bit. We're buying a home that I'd like to outfit with HA, and would love any advice ya'll have. Specifically, I've dug deep into Lutron's Caseta and RA2 Select lines, and sounds like it's hard to beat the reliability and simplicity there. But the idea of a little more control also appeals, though I don't have time to do real programming beyond some IFTTT rules and a few conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I consider anything** ***other*** **than those two Lutron lines?** (It's going to be dependent on whether I can source RA2 Select stuff reasonably or not.)  ZWave? Zigbee? Etc...

&amp;#x200B;

For context, other gear:

\- All Android devices

\- Google Homes (mostly minis, a Home Hub)

\- Previously was using Frontpoint for a security system ([Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) powered), with a video doorbell by Skybell - up for changing, but liked it decently well.

&amp;#x200B;

Requirements:

\- Simple to operate. Wife doesn't like complexity, and we have two young kids. 

\- Reliable. X10 is the opposite. :) Don't have time to do major programming.

\- Also need some video cameras - debating having them integrated into system vs. standalone.

\- Whole-house-ish ""off"" button for when we're running out quickly with the kids.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideal:

\- Would have more audio integration, like tactile (tablet/physical) media play/volume buttons.

\- Some degree of customizability.

\- Lighting colors. (Yes, I know about DMX, but dang that's way more than I want to get into).

\- Would integrate with things like garage doors, door locks, etc.

Question 1: Is it possible to have a smart switch wired so that what is wired to it is always powered?  
Question 2: I have a wall switch that is currently not connected to anything. Can I put a smart switch here to control other devices?

-----------

The first thing I want to do is setup controls for the lights and fan in the bedroom. I think what I want to do will make my wife appreciate what can be done with automation and remote/voice control. Here's our current setup.

#Wall Switch 1

We have a Harbor Breeze ceiling fan. It's not a smart fan, but is controlled via a RF remote. The wall switch literally just stays in the on position 100% of the time. The remote has speeds 1 - 6, plus a ""breeze"" setting that randomly varies the speed. You can turn the light on or off, or hold the light button down to dim the light. The switch for reversing the direction for winter is also on the remote. Literally every function of the fan/light is controlled by the remote.

#Wall Switch 2

Does nothing. I think it's wired for a traditional fan so that one switch can turn the light on/off and the other one turns the fan on/off. We are the ones that put the current fan into the bedroom, but we did it within the first couple of weeks of buying the house and I just can't remember if that's how it worked with the previous fan. Just to make sure, I have tested both the tops and bottoms of every outlet in the room. It does not control them.

#Wall Outlet

In the outlet behind the bed, there are two lamps plugged in. They are just small reading lamps with a toggle switch built into the cord. They are mounted onto the wall above the bed. One on my side, one on my wife's side. It's the kind that can be swiveled around and the beam is sorta focused. To be honest, we use this more than the overhead light. Most of the time we have these two lights pointed up towards the ceiling and out towards the middle of the room a bit. It lights up the room really well without having a light shining in your face.

#What I want to do

I have a Hubitat hub, which currently does nothing because I don't have anything to connect to it yet. I am literally just starting out.

First off, I know I will need something that can send RF signals to the fan. I am thinking of picking up a [Bond](https://bondhome.io/) for this, since it could also control the living room fan (another Harbor Breeze similar to the one in the bedroom, which actually has the same remote). Though I am open to other suggestions, because I would prefer something that is not wifi based. I'd rather it connect to my hub so the commands can be sent locally. Though, I am unsure if Bond relies on the cloud, or if the commands would just travel over my home network.

I want to replace Wall Switch 1 with a smart switch. This is the switch that just stays turned on 100% of the time. Is it possible to have a smart switch wired up so that the device it controls is always powered? We want to still be able to use the remote to turn the fan/light on. If it's toggled off, I just want it to send a command to the fan to turn the fan and light off. When it's toggled on, I want it to send a command to the fan to turn the light on and put the fan on speed 2.

I want to do something similar with Wall Switch 2. I want to put a smart switch in. I will get 2 smart plugs for the lamps. So when you toggle the switch on, the lamps come on and off turns them off.  I've seen that some (or all? I dunno) smart switches let you do things like double tap power on to do something different, so I'd set this one up to make a double tap of the power on turn on the lamps and the fan light. However, I'll need a way to turn them on/off from the bed as well, otherwise my wife will just use the switch on the cord to turn hers off and then the lamp won't have power; I've seen simple ""smart buttons"" that are just, well.... small buttons like a doorbell. I think one of these on each side of the bed would work to toggle the single light on and off. I think my wife would like this because it would let her hide the toggle switch on the lamp cord behind the bed's headboard.

Of course, there's more I want to do, but this is what I want to start with. I have only started looking at switches, and I gotta be honest it's a little overwhelming. I'm sure as I get into it more, I'll know what I'm looking for, but right now I'm sorta at a loss; there's just so many different options and I don't know which ones will do want I want.

Also, as a side note, I do not know if these particular wall switches have a neutral wire, but I suspect they probably do. I know the switches in my bathrooms do because I recently got a timer switch for my bathroom fans.",waterboysh,/r/smarthome/comments/ch8jrr/just_starting_off_can_someone_help_me_figure_out/,2,smarthome,12

My current plans:

* One ethernet cable ran from each room (not bathrooms) down to what will eventually be my server room in the basement

* One ethernet cable to each exterior corner of the house for future security cameras that will run on PoE

* Speaker cables from where the receiver will be to where the surround speakers will be in the living room

chf1wk,1564007158,Is Kevo's Touch-to-Open feature unique to their product?,"Question in title. I really like the touch-to-open / tap 3x to lock feature, but I don't really like the rest of the Kevo product. I want to switch to a different door lock that I could perhaps tie into HomeAssistant, but nothing else has a similar feature and I fear this is the only thing tying me to the product.  
  
I don't want an auto lock/unlock based on proximity or X minutes away from a geofenced location. The reason for this is I work on various projects all over the house and nearby during the weekends and I'd be pissed to come back to find my door locked itself on me because I barely triggered the auto lock criteria.  

I also don't want to take my phone out and open an app to lock my door on my way out of the house. I'd rather just get my key out and lock it normally.  
  
With Kevo it's been really streamlined, simple, and fits my lifestyle. If I'm leaving, I tap the door lock 3x on the outside and it locks. If I'm coming home, as long as my phone is in my pocket, tapping the door lock once unlocks the door. But if I wanted to expand any more functionality, I am forced to buy their Kevo Plus hub.  
  
I would like to explore new products, but need some suggestions. Trying to avoid keypad solutions, but if that's all there is, I might try one.",John5788,/r/homeautomation/comments/chf1wk/is_kevos_touchtoopen_feature_unique_to_their/,1,homeautomation,0

chmt5u,1564056436,How smart bed is better than a normal bed," 

A smart bed is a bed that uses a variety of technologies such as pressure and heartbeat sensors, temperature control, and auto-recline to gather data about your sleep and wake-up patterns, which it then puts to good use to help you achieve a better night's rest. Smart bed technology is being used in the [new projects in Mumbai.](http://www.hawareintelligentia.com/new-residential-projects-in-mumbai.html)

A standard bed is what you grew up sleeping on. It can be foam, spring, or a hybrid of both; they contain no technology. A typical mattress is not personalized to your sleep habits and is designed simply as a place to sleep. Thus new-age [real estate developers in Mumbai](http://www.hawareintelligentia.com/real-estate-developers-in-mumbai.html) are upgrading from the standard bed.

The Different Features of a Smart Bed v/s Normal Bed

**Sleep Tracking:** The ability to keep track of how well you sleep is literally the most distinguishing aspect of a smart mattress as opposed to a regular one. Using a single sheet of ""smart fabric"" or several sensors spread throughout the bed, the smart mattress tracks a variety of information such as respiration, heartbeat, sleep restfulness and body pressure to determine how to give you the most comfortable night's rest.

A normal bed has no such smart technology it could just be as soft and cozy as you want, but not intelligent enough to track your sleep pattern. If you want to track your sleep on a standard mattress, you either have to cuddle up next to your smartphone or wear an uncomfortable sleep tracking bracelet to bed.

**Temperature Control:** Smart beds sometimes come integrated with a built-in thermostat, which allows you to regulate the temperature of the mattress during sleep.

Normal beds with a normal mattress wouldnât have thermostat regulation. However Higher-density memory foam mattresses do softens in reaction to body heat, allowing it to mold to a warm body in a few minutes.

**Air Chambers:** Inflated air tubes inside the mattress come packed with pressure sensors that allow it to adjust to your body posture while you sleep. These air tubes can also be controlled remotely via the smart bed's app.

Only Memory foam mattresses on normal beds can be used for pressure regulation where it significantly adjusts to continuous pressure to reduce any discomfort. Normal beds otherwise are only limited to providing rest, it offers no way of knowing if and how your sleep changes.

**App Integration:** Your smart bed connects to the internet and other smart home gadgets. Applications for virtual assistants, thermostats, smart lights, coffee makers and television sets all are seamlessly integrated allowing you full control.

No technology is connected to your normal bed.

Now that you know what smart beds really are and what exactly they can do more for you than the normal bed, you would really want one, but unless you have a fully-featured smart home you cannot get it installed. A smart and intelligent [property in Mumbai](http://www.hawareintelligentia.com/) is an indispensable luxury you need for a smooth daily life.

* Garage Door
* Windows
* Dimmer/Switch with double or triple tap functionality

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of the sensors I have used:

* Samsung Multi-sensor.  These are not great.  My biggest issue is that the batteries die without warning and SmartThings doesn't report that a sensor is not checking in.   Next issue is that changing the batteries is a pain in the butt.  Most of them sit between the blinds and the window, and getting it off of the window without pulling off the double-sided tape is impossible.  Also, the back of the device isn't flat which doesn't make it great for double-sided tape.  I get false alerts because of the device falling off the window.
* Monoprice Garage Door z-wave.  This thing has been decent, except for the frequent false positives.  Probably once a week my garage is ""open"" in the night.  I've verified that it is indeed closed.
* GE Zigbee Outet switch.  These things are rock solid.  No issues.
* HomeSeer Dimmers.  As switches and dimmers, they are fine.  They are supposed to allow double and triple tap functionality that I got to work until the first update SmartThings did.  Now they now longer triple or double tap.

chtmvs,1564089207,"Nvidia Shield is a waste of money, change my mind... Please, change my mind.","I bought an Nvidia Shield a month ago. I bought it to use it as a Plex client. So far the Nvidia Shield performance has been a huge disappointment. Currently I own a Sony smart TV, Roku Stick+, PS4 Pro and Vizio Sound Bar 5.1. I live in USA but my first language is Spanish. Despite being able to watch pretty much any movie in English, there are some anime and shows that I need to use subtitles (The Wire I am looking at you). Therefore, Subtitles are a big deal for me.
These are the reasons why I think Nvidia Shield is not superior to my Roku Stick+:
1. Nvidia Shield shutters some videos when using EAC3 5.1
2. Nvidia Shield will transcode video if using subtitles while transcoding audio.
3. Nvidia Shield gave me black screen while using TRUEHD 7.1 in different movies. 
4. The UI is not so good. 

PS4:
- Similiar experiences to the Nvidia Shield. The UI is so clunky that is not even worth trying to use it as an everyday client.

The android TV is the worst as a client; not wasting my time talking about it either.

Roku Stick+:
1. So far it has been able to Direct Play everything with .str subtitles while transcoding audio.
2. It will transcode EAC3 5.1 to AAC, no video shuttering at all. 
3. UI is quite straight foward.
4. only 49.99 (got it on sale).
5. Not a good point but it will transcode audio almost always.

There are some good things about the Shield. It will Direct Play video and sound as long as the audio is compatible with your hardware. One advice that people had given to me is to buy a audio receiver, which is going to cost me $300USD+ that I am not willing to spend because I am happy with my sound bad. 

Now, the other reason why I bought the Nvidia Shield was to play retro games like Snes, N64, Wii and GC. But after trying to play Wii I realized that if you don't have the Dolphin Bar and a Original Wii controller your game catalog is going to be very limited because the need of shaking the remote or something like that in the majority of the games. Then I tried GC, it does the job despite the poor sound quality. Then I tried Snes... The input lag is annoying, it is like 0.5 seconds. I tried with an Xbox controller, PS4 controller and then Android controller. Tried all of then both wireless and wired; no success, input lag the same. I am using RetroArch. 

then I need some thinking and remember that a Nintendo Wii with standard accesories (1 controller+ Nunchuck) is around $50USD, if I flash it I will be able to play GC, Wii, Snes, Gba, etc. in Excelent quality (I have done that before. I know it works flawlessly) 

My problem is, I already have this $180USD device... I would totally love and appreciate if someone change my mind and refer me to a video or something that could improve my experience with the Nvidia Shield because I am out of the return policy window.",chuchodavids,/r/smarthome/comments/chtmvs/nvidia_shield_is_a_waste_of_money_change_my_mind/,0,smarthome,13

I saw that some needed a hub and some did not. I *assumed* at the time that because some did not need a hub, they were clearly more advanced since they were able to connect and function independently of an additional piece of hardware. Everything worked well, and I slowly acquired more and more. As of now, I have about 40 pieces of smart gear in our house (like 12 google products and the rest is a smart vacuum and various switches and bulbs imported from China where the individual apps connect with Google Home and are run through there). I had not really thought about it before, but when I recently joined this sub, I started reading things that have given me the impression that having things linked to a hub is NOT an ""outdated"" setup and is actually preferable. 

So here's the thing. I am wanting to start automating more things at our photo studio/AirBNB house. Right now, I only have 6 things (3 google and 3 smart bulbs).

chy7ix,1564114946,Smart Home and Automation: First Impressions and Lessons Learned,"I recently delved into smart home and home automation, mostly for fun. Although I still have a lot to learn, here are my initial impressions, what I liked, and what I would do differently. I decided to use products that are all compatible with Google Home. As this is mostly for fun and experimentation, I tried to keep costs fairly low. I liked the idea of zigbee and z-wave, but this didn't usually work out due to cost and compatibility with Google Home. Maybe a few years from now, things will be less fragmented and I'll put together a better system. For now, there's a lot of different apps on my phone. Costs below are approximations of what I paid on sale, and you may be able to find the for similar or lower prices with some patience.

Here's how the various devices worked out for me so far.

* **Thermostat** (Nest) - most useful addition, this fixed my problem of uneven cooling between floors by running the fan for a bit after the ac turns off.  Other useful features have been auto adjusting the temperature when I leave, and being able to adjust the thermostat from another room. Nest supports connecting with other products for some automation, but so far I haven't found that feature useful.
   * Usefulness: High (fixed uneven heating)
   * Cost: $190
* **Smart Light** (Philips Hue) - with an array of fancy features, including color changing, these ended up being expensive and not that useful. I used these in lamps to add a switch that is more convenient to reach than the one on the lamp. There's some useful automations, including a ""gentle wakeup"" feature that can integrate with google home alarms Alarm integration only works through google home speaker. On the phone, you have to set a manual time and enable/disable it when you do so with your alarm. However, you have to make sure no one turns the lamp off, and you have to buy the switch separately, unless you don't want a way to physically toggle the light.
   * Usefulness: Low
   * Cost: $30/color bulb, $15/white bulb, $20/switch
* **Smart switch** (TP-Link Kasa)  - a great way to turn all the lights in the room into smart lights, without having to replace each bulb with an expensive smart bulb. It can function as a regular switch, or be controlled through voice, phone, or automation. Does take some work to install, especially if you're using the 3-way switches and only putting it on the upstream switch.
   * Usefulness: Medium (nice for turning on/off lights automatically, but nothing you can't do manually quite easily)
   * Cost: $18
* **Motion sensor switch -** turn on a light when you open a closet, and off when you close it. A simple solution when you have a light switch and light inside a closet. It doesn't hook up to your phone or smart home system, but it doesn't need to. Cheaper than buying a motion sensor and smart switch, and works without a router or internet.
   * Usefulness: Medium
   * Cost $20 (plus cost of wall plate if the included ones don't work for your setup)
* **Smart lock** (August) - tried out two kinds of locks, one with wireless and pin, and another with wireless and regular key. Between the two, it's very hard to accidentally get locked out. Comes with built-in support to auto-unlock when you get home, although this seems to require you to go some distance from the house, not just to the end of the driveway and back. It also only supports auto-unlock of one lock per house for some reason. Being able to give someone temporary access with a pin or the app, or even unlock it remotely for them, is very handy for emergencies or housesitters. Connects to Nest but haven't found a use for that yet. Unfortunately the Google Home compatible version does not work with z-wave/SmartThings.
   * Usefulness: High (keep your keys in your pocket and never lock yourself out)
   * Cost: $145-170 per lock

In addition to the actual devices that do things, I tried out some controllers, hub, and sensors to control and automate the devices.

* **Smart Speaker** (Google Home and Mini) - Since my home is not perfectly automated, I also want easy ways to manually control things. Scattering these about adds voice control to the house, as well as the ability to play music and make calls on them. Various parts where it could use improvement, including less verbose replies, responding from the one in the same room as you always instead of one further away, and a better or customizable phrase besides ""Ok google"". The integration with my phone could be better. It pops up a thing on the phone screen when I talk to it, even though it answers through the speaker (when I'd rather it didn't interrupt me on the phone). It also basically disables voice control of the phone when you're near a speaker, which is okay until you want to do something that only the phone supports, like text messaging. Alarms set on the google home don't display on your phone, so good luck remembering to enable/disable it on vacation. Alarms set on your phone can't play through google home.
   * Usefulness: High
   * Cost: $50 Home, $24 Mini
* **Temperature Sensor** (Nest) - I added a temperature sensor to the other floor than the thermostat to help with making it comfortable where I want it. Disappointingly, it doesn't have an option to run the fan when the temperature difference between floors hits a threshold, nor a way to autodetect which rooms are occupied.
   * Usefulness: Medium
   * Cost: $40
* **Smartthings Hub** \- I wanted a hub that could connect all my devices, let me write automations without messing with code or config files, and work even if the internet goes down. The Smartthings hub has been kind of meh in this regard, but is has the right idea. Unfortunately it doesn't connect to the Nest Thermostat nor the versions of the August locks I have. The app is a nice and easy way to create automations for the devices that do work with it though. Hoping to use this to turn on a light when I get home after dark.
   * Usefulness: Medium
   * Cost: $60
* **SmartThings** **Multipurpose Sensor** \- Nice for automating lights with a smart switch in closets or attic where a motion sensor switch doesn't work. The smart locks already have a sensor like this to detect when the exterior doors are open or closed, so it's not useful there. I haven't found a use for the temperature sensor, especially since it doesn't connect with Nest.
   * Usefulness: Medium
   * Cost $10

I plan to also try the Smartthings leak sensor and motion sensor, although I don't know what I'll use the latter for yet. Hopefully this is helpful to other people getting started. Also looking for ideas on improving it, other things to try out, and what I might do differently if I do it all over again some day.",Pollox,/r/homeautomation/comments/chy7ix/smart_home_and_automation_first_impressions_and/,8,homeautomation,19

ci147x,1564136532,Looking for a smart plug with temp sensor but open to other solutions.,"Let me start out with what I want to do. I want to have the small fan in my room turn on when the temperature gets too high because I work nights and sleep during the day the house can get hot even when doing the old trick of opening the house during the morning and keeping in the cold air. 

I want it to turn on a regular room fan with a physical switch. My plan was to plug in my fan into a smart plug that works with Alexa. And then have the sensor trigger the fan when it gets too hot while Iâm sleeping and canât do that. 

I use Alexa most so would like most but I also have a google home mini and a nest. But the nest is in the other side of the house and we only use it for heating the house in winter.  But the temperature where the nest is would not be accurate for my room. Iâm willing to buy their sensors if it will let me do this project but nest will stop working with Alexa next month I heard?

I bought a sonoff th16 with ref controller thinking it would plug into the wall. Be able to connect to WiFi and Iâd be able to set up a process to turn on the fan when it reached a certain temp in my room. But this does not plug into the wall. Iâm fact I canât figure out what it supposed to be for or how to power it. Would I ever be able to make this do what I want or should I just return it?

I also have an echo spot I heard some of them had a temp sensor maybe I could utilize that somehow? Why is this such a frustrating project for something seemingly simple?

The only thing I've done so far is replaced the thermostats with Nest Thermostats.  My next phase is to convert my porch lights and the safety lights in my stairs.

The porch lights, I figure I'll just get switches for each, rather than deal with the cost of replacing smart bulbs when they die.  But the safety lights on my stairs are the biggest concern.

There is a standard switch at both the top and bottom of the stairs, controlling the circuit.  Flip one of them and the lights (two separate fixtures connected to the same circuit) go on or off, depending on their current state.  I'd like to replace both switches with ones that I can combine/merge/marry/unify/etc so that they work in tandem without conflicting with each other in the system.  If that's even a risk.

Ideally, I'd love it if I could program all of these switches to turn on at sunset/dusk and off at sunrise/dawn.  Completely eliminate the need to remember to flip a switch.  Having them be compatible with Google Home, or something else that's Nest compatible is a plus.  I'd prefer not to be cursed with too many hubs/consoles around the house.

ci7sby,1564171708,Question about using two phones.,"I'm new to all of this--we're closing on our first house next month, and want to start setting up smart home features. One question I haven't been able to find an answer for. I understand that with a hub, you can have all your controls in a single phone app. I'm assuming as well that my wife and I can both have that app on our phones, both tied to the same hub. My question is, will it make a difference if one of us has an Android phone and one has an iPhone? She greatly prefers Android and doesn't want to switch; but my company provides my phone, so I have no choice but to use an iPhone.

Many of the sources I've looked at seem to indicate that systems may depend on using one of the virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc.) Obviously the two of us have different assistants, so I'm wondering how this will play out. I honestly hate talking to Siri anyway, except as a novelty, and my wife never uses the assistant on her phone, so neither of us are really interested in using voice commands anyway. We'd be content just manually controlling via an app.

Thank you in advance!

Reolink 5MP PoE Camera 2560x1920 Super HD 4X Optical Zoom Outdoor -- I like this because of the optical zoom; the easiest place for me to install this is across the driveway from the door on the garage.  I am not sure it works with Google Home though.

Kasa Cam Outdoor by TP-Link - 1080p HD -- I have some tplink wifi plug things and they are programmable via python code running on the local network.  I hope their cameras have been similarly reverse engineered?

**Ground Floor:**

* Echo Show (Gen 2) - this is my main 'hub' device so my family can control my smart devices using Alexa
* Ring 2 Video Doorbell  - I use Alexa Show as well as my smartphone to access the live video feed.
* Nest Learning Thermostat - I haven't used it much with Alexa but I can see that it's compatible. I struggled with simply 'turning off' the heat (I don't think there is a command that does that?)
* Eufy Robovac 30C (smart robot hoover)

**Attic:**

* Echo Dot Gen 3
* Philips Hue Lights

I have some questions please:

I'd like to fit an outdoor camera on the front of my home as well as back. And also one or two indoor cameras would be great.

* What smart cameras would people here suggest? I don't know which ones are best. I would need it to be compatible with Alexa Show please. I've heard Ring Cameras are good (Since I have a Ring Doorbell would this be ideal right?).
* Is it worth paying the Ring subscription so that I can keep video recordings?
* What smart alarm system would people recommend here?

I replaced the wires exactly as they were but when I flipped the breaker back on the light and fan came on (although the light was dimmed) but the switch did not work and none of the LEDs lit up. 

Any ideas? Help!

ciq450,1564278833,Kasa outdoor smart plug driving me BANANAS *please help*,"TLDR:  My two [Kasa outdoor smart plugs](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-wifi-outdoor-plug-kp400) worked beautifully with a Netgear [Nighthawk x6 router](https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R8000.aspx). Then I upgraded to a mesh network using three [TP Link Deco M9s](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/deco/deco-m9-plus/)... everything worked fine for a while but after a power outage the Kasa plugs won't connect to wifi at all.  All my other IOT devices still work just fine after the outage.  Fully ironic given TP Link owns Kasa.

BONUS PROTIP - before installing any Nest anything, take a picture of the QR code on the back of the device and save them somewhere.  Then when you inevitably have to reset them you won't have to physically take the device off the wall or ceiling to rescan the QR code, you can just scan your picture of the code.  Much, much easier.

\-----

Long version:

I have a fair amount of IOT devices in my two story, 2000 sq ft. house, including 16 Sonos speakers, a Nest doorbell, four Nest Outdoor IQ cameras, two Google Homes (with display), five Nest smoke detectors, a few cheapo TECKIN indoor smart plugs, twelve Philips Hue bulbs, a Roomba, ADT Command Panel, and a couple of Chromecasts.

I also have the Kasa outdoor smart plugs in question.

It was previously all connected through a Netgear Nighthawk x6 router with ATT Fiber, which hardwired gets 820 mb/s download speed.  It all worked pretty well together, but there was a lot of congestion with the Nighthawk as the sole access point and it was affecting playback on my Sonos speakers and I had to set the bandwidth on my Nest cameras to mid or low to avoid issues.

I did a bunch of research on mesh wifi systems to alleviate the congestion issues and settled on the [TP Link M9 Plus system](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/deco/deco-m9-plus/) with three units (one hardwired and two wifi).  Set it up with the same SSID and PW as the previous Nighthawk so I didn't have to go around resetting everything (Nest products are a particular PITA when changing Wifi SSIDs or PWs).

Everything worked great for a while, INCLUDING the Kasa plug.  Significantly less issues with Sonos, all Nest cameras set to high bandwith and working great, much faster wifi speeds upstairs on the opposite side of the house from the downstairs Nighthawk.   I'm very happy with the M9 mesh system, and get over 300 mb/s over wifi all over the house. 

I hid my SSID for a while as I have a sort of obnoxious SSID (""Spyware Virus"") and to maybe give a bit more security (which after reading [this](https://www.accessagility.com/blog/why-ssid-hiding-is-not-secure), I guess I'll leave it public).  Everything still worked fine with the SSID hidden, including the two Kasa plugs.

Then one fateful day I had a power outage.  After the power came back up, all devices reconnected just fine aside from the Kasa plugs and the Nest Cameras.  For the Nest Cameras to get back online, I had to unhide the SSID and factory reset a couple of the cameras (strangely not all of them).  It was a pain in the ass getting on the ladder, unplugging them, reconnecting them to the app with the stupid QR codes on the back of the devices, but still it worked.

But alas the Kasa plugs would not reconnect even after unhiding the SSID.  I've tried unplugging the cameras for 30 seconds, factory resetting the plugs, removing them from the Kasa app, disabling the 5 GHz band on the mesh wifi (since Kasa plugs only work on 2.4 GHz), setting up the plugs inside (three feet from the hardwired M9 unit), resetting the routers, resetting both the plugs and the routers at the same time, spent over an hour chatting with tech support chat and tinkering with various settings in the Deco app, and NOTHING WORKS.

The Kasa app will connect to the smart plug, allow me to input the SSID and PW, say ""connecting to wifi"" with this endless circle going around forever.  On the plug itself, it will blink green for a while after the app says ""connecting to wifi"" but then go back to blinking orange and green as it does on setup.  The app meanwhile still has that endless circle until I force close it.

Suspecting that maybe, just mayyyyyybe, the plugs were fried somehow in the power outage, I took the plug to my girlfriend's house, where I gave her the old Netgear Nighthawk and it still has the same old SSID and PW.  Tried setting up the plug there (with the same SSID and PW as my current house!) and it worked FLAWLESSLY.  Set up was quick and easy, it worked the first time, I could turn off and on the plug with the app, everything.  The plug got the latest firmware update after setting it up.

I took the plugs back to my house now that they were setup and should connect to the wifi since we have the same SSID and PW, but it still won't work!  Just blinks red and says it's not connected to wifi.  I factory reset it again, and get the same old endless circle on setup.

Now I could just give her the plugs too and try to find a different product to automate my outdoor plugs. That would probably be a better use of my time than endless troubleshooting and writing tomes on reddit, but I just can't. fucking. let. it. go.

It's some issue with the M9 mesh system interacting with the Kasa plug, but I have no idea what else it could be.  The mesh network works just fine with ALL other devices, and the plug works just fine with another router.  They just don't work together.  TP Link owns Kasa, which makes it even more infuriating.

# Libre Home is Functional Complete, thus More Versatile

I always hear complains about other HA systems being ""not flexible enough"". While user may not know exactly why I certainly know the reason.

Because the user requirement is complex by nature. It is understandable that the system by default cannot offer all features everybody ever wanted. That is why several systems touted ""app engine"" that enabled others to build apps to perform certain types of automation.

However, so far non of those ""app engine"" is designed correctly. That is why they can't even perform some extremely simple tasks, no matter how hard users banging their heads.

Here is a simple example, ""Holiday Light Show"". User can tell Libre Hub to automatically blink lights using smart switches. Number of lights can be arbitrary, can be 1 light, 10 lights, 100 lights. Lights can be separated into many groups. The process is like this:

Set light ""level"" of each light in the current group (done immediately)Wait for specified secondsRepeat on next group and ""wait seconds"" in an infinite loop.

Below is screenshot of smartphone creating blinking two lights with a pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/y2h2192n72d31.png

This complex App is only 8 lines of code. \[[See code here!](http://librehome.com/doc/developers_doc/getting_started/holiday_light_show/#%20copy-source-code)\].

It doesn't matter whether or not you think blinking lights is useful. If there is no way absolutely whatsoever to blink two lights on other system like we do, what else can they do?

# Minimalist Design, Maximum Potential

You don't need a thermostat with a dual core ARM, 128MB of memory, 2 radios and a lithium battery that generates a lot of heats, and upload all your data to cloud.

It can be much simpler, more reliable and less expensive. With App Engine we can evolve an App to give the thermostat the most intelligence.

cj93bf,1564393856,Smart light switch (Jinvoo) cabling issue,"Hi, i'm hoping someone with a little electrical experience can help me with my smart light switch issue.

I've bought this switch  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07G9ZMRG4](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07G9ZMRG4), low reviews but it was Prime Day and I took a punt.

I went to wire it in, but discovered my wiring for my lights is not what the schematic for the switch wants. I have two independent lights, and thus two loops. One Live and Neutral for each light, and the switch just completes the circuit (I think, conceptually, that means all four are Live or Neutral, as the crossover point of the light itself is later on (or earlier, not sure) in the circuit). This smart switch wants one live and three neutrals. I assume one neutral is for its own power, and then other two are what it uses to complete the circuits to the lights.

Problem is, I don't have that 3rd neutral. So I figured, neutral is neutral, and I plugged the second lights neutral into both the second light and the main Neutral pin. This worked for the first light, but as soon as I turn on the second light, the switch resets. This is where my electrical knowledge falls short and i'm not sure if i'm shorting it out or something.

I guess my question is, has anyone faced this before, and how did you get over it?

So, I need a solution to an issue Iâve ran into during a kitchen refitting. I have installed LIFX LED strips all over the kitchen which can all be powered on/off via one switch on the wall. That works great, but now Iâve decided to put another LIFX kit under the island/breakfast bar that we have, although this is not controlled by that same switch on the wall.

Are there any solutions out there? I have seen some kickstarters that never shipped such as LampLink which provide the exact solution I need.

If possible, I want to also try and avoid the use of WiFi as our home network does not broadcast an SSID because of how I have set everything up lol but I can create a sub network if needed.

The LampLink and Switcheroo kits I have seen use radio channels to send the power on/off command to the receiving outlets so something along those lines would be great!

Btw iâm in the UK so plug needs to support 240V and please note that there is already power at the island, I just need a way to have it seamlessly power on/off.

**Phillips Hue:** Color and White bulbs - these are good where you like color, and work pretty well for lamps.  
**Wemo Plug-in module:** Came free with an echo dot - just on-off for one lamp  
**Wifi Bulbs:** 1 bulb and 2 light strip that work with the ""Magic Home"" App, and another light bulb that works with the ""Smart Life"" app\* - I got these because they were cheaper than Hue  
**Insteon:** Only one with a good solution for ceiling fan with light, and for tight spaces with their micro dimmers. I also have some standard Insteon switches as well as 4 Insteon 8-button Keypads.  
**X10:** Older X10 modules that I want to replace  
**Amazon Echo:** I have several echos throughout the house for voice control  
**OpenHab:** I have a Linux PC running OpenHab to try to tie it all together  
**IPad:** I have an iPad running with a kiosk mode browser open to an OpenHabPannel instance mounted in the kitchen.

\* - The Smart Life bulb can't be controlled (at least not without a lot of programming) via OpenHab, but it works with the Echo. I can't control the X10 stuff from OpenHab or Echo.

OK, so I need to add in control / monitoring for 12 additional wall switches, 3 ceiling fans, 2 garage doors, and 2 lamps. I also plan to add control panels (using old iPads or HP Slate computers I already have on hand). Some of these have old X10 switches and some just traditional switches. Most of these things can be done via Insteon, and that would be my first choice. These all work will together, but when I want to use something like a keypad to control non-Insteon devices through OpenHab it requires a lot of programming work and can still be a little unreliable (as well as having some significant lag from button press to action).

Are there other options other than Insteon for multi-button control (like their keypads), that work well for ceiling fans (like their fan module) and that work in tight spaces (like their micro dimmers, etc.)?  These are relatively expensive and it would be nice to finish things out for less money.

Are there better options than OpenHab for tying together a disparate system like this?

TL;DR I have a system of mixed brands of home automation equipment using OpenHab to tie them together and am wondering if there is a better and/or cheaper way to finish out my system.",varneyb,/r/smarthome/comments/cjcwwx/mixed_system/,3,smarthome,3

I tried going with a pair of the Nest 3rd gen smart thermostats, and when the pro installer came out they determined that Next is incompatible with my HVAC system because it can't communicate wirelessly. So Nest is not an option.

I don't necessarily have to have a thermostat on the first level as long as I can still maintain the two zones since its a fairly large house, and can maintain temp via my phone or smart assistant (Google Home).

cjozu4,1564476670,RGB code for Philips Hue Warm White,"Hi everybody,

I am currently using two zigbee light bulbs in my office. One is a `Philips Hue Warm White` and the other an `Innr RB 185 C.` The Innr bulb has RGB, brightness, and color temperature control and I am trying make those bulbs look the same.

Usually I'd go on some RGB color code generator, get an approximately fitting color (which is already not that easy because those colors might look different on my monitor than they will on the light bulb), turn on both lights, then try matching the RGB value to the color temperature my Hue has.

However, as you might have guessed by now, it doesn't work. Either it is too bright, too low, too cold (more yellowish/greenish/blueish) or too warm, etc. etc. Does anybody have an RGB light and has already found the exact color code needed to match ""generic warm light"" (or whatever the tone is the Hue displays)?

I want both lights to match when they are both on 100% brightness. Currently I don't have use for any additional zigbee controlled bulbs, otherwise I'd buy another Hue Warm White and switch it with the Innr, but I'd really like to keep the Innr in place because I want it to trigger different things (for example, when the front gate opens, turn to red for 5 seconds, when the laundry is done, turn to blue, etc.), which I have already sort of implemented, so the best solution would just be to find that exact tone I need.

Due to the brightness and/or my camera you might not be able to tell the difference, but I have attached a photo anyway. If you are physically in front of both lamps, you can see an obvious difference.

[left Innr RGB, right Philips Hue](https://i.redd.it/l4vcjr95ned31.jpg)

The current RGB value I use is `FFD572`, which is a bit too cold and yellow/greenish compared to the warm white Hue color.

Only other thing is I read about BT which is off for both devices, whether they enable this for v3 or neither is anyone's guess. The obvious answer seems to be v2 for me however I am worried that it won't be supported by updates as long and may become redundant when the v3 would still be fine.

cjs8rc,1564495588,"Automating A/C Units â Sonoff POW, Broadlink, and Node-RED (Hassio)","Hi folks,

I have several mini-split A/C units that I would like to add some automation to, and wanted to know if anyone had done this as of yet, and/or has any advice for me.

Background: I have a total of 5 Mirage mini-split A/C Units, consisting on 2 X 1 Â½ Ton, and 3 X 1 Ton units, in 5 separate rooms. Each unit has its own âdumbâ remote, that just sends signals to the units, with no positive feedback that it received the signals.

Iâd like to be able to turn on/off the various A/C units, using a variety of methods, including voice and time-based commands.

Plans: I intend on using a combination of a Sonoff POW switch and Broadlink rm mini for each unit/room, and tie it all together using Node-RED, running on a Raspberry Pi.

The Sonoff POWâs will be connected directly to the A/C units, however, I will **not** be using the Sonoffs to cycle power to the A/C units. I will use the power meter readings only, to verify it received the signal Iâll be sending it.

For example, if I send the A/C unit the RF code to turn on to 27 deg., itâs current state would be off, followed by it turning on. I would then check the Sonoffâs power consumption value, say 10/15 seconds after sending the command to verify that the unit did turn on. If the power consumption is still low, I would send the RF command again, wait 10/15 seconds, and verify again.

The same logic would be used to turn off the units, sending the off command, and then verifying consumption went down, repeating as needed.

I do not expect to tell the difference between temperatures, and probably not even fan speed variances, however, I am confident that if I send the correct command, itâs just a matter of verifying the unit received a command or not.

In terms of the electrical side of things, hereâs the specs for each A/C unit, and the Sonoff POW

1 ton â 230V â 1,000 Watts â 4.5 Amps

1 Â½ ton â 230V â 1,600 Watts â 7.7 Amps

Sonoff POW â 90 \~ 250V â 3,500 Watts max â 16 Amps max

cjsluk,1564497294,Braava vs ILIFE W400?,"After reading through reviews, I've concluded that it's better to get a dedicated mopping robot rather than get a hybrid vaccuum/mopping robot. The hybrids seem to just drag a wet cloth behind them. I got the Eufy 15C MAX for vaccuuming. Very happy with it although it annoys me a bit when it misses a few spots here and there.

Now that I've tried out a robot for vacuuming, I'm interested in finding one for mopping floors. My budget is no more than $250, so that means I'd be considering the Braava 240, Braava 380 or ILIFE W400. I can't find much information on the ILIFE W400. There are a few reviews that suggest it's very good at mopping since it has a rolling scrub brush. Further, it can be used on wood flooring (which I have) and it can't ""climb"" onto carpets, so I don't need to worry about it trying to wash the rugs in the living room. However, it's enormous! It doesn't look like it'd fit under the toe kicks (recessed areas) under my cabinets in the kitchen and it probably wouldn't be able to clean the area around the toilet. In contrast, the Braava 240 would have no problem. Plus, the Braava 240 is a bit cheaper. Does anyone have good experience with the Braava 240 being able to scrub a bit, or does it just drag a wet mop behind it? Also, I have an open floor plan of \~800 sq. feet so the robot needs to be able to navigate a large area. I don't mind mopping in a grid pattern, but I'm not sure if I can tell the Braava 240 to mop only a small area, recharge the battery and then mop the next area.

cjtgke,1564501041,Zigbee vs Z-Wave for larger homes/yards,"Hey all, I know, I know, another z-wave vs zigbee thread. I've done a lot of reading but I'm looking for some advice before I take the plunge.

Moved out to an acreage in the Spring. Looking at improving the automation of my home. Currently just have the basics, Nest thermostat, temp sensors, nest protects, etc. Starting with Home Assistant /w Zigbee/Z-wave USB sticks right now for more of the fine-grained automations like switches, plugs, door/window sensors, etc, as I've grown tired of the Google Home limitations.

I'd like to stick to one standard as much as I possibly can. I was leaning towards Z-Wave only because it seems the devices are much more available/cheaper in Canada than Zigbee. My concern with Z-Wave is to do with the max 4 hops. 

I've got a 2400 square foot house, and a large detached garage roughly 90 feet from the house. I've wired up a full Ubiquiti network, with two access points on both sides of the house, as well as a bridge (NanoBeam) between the house &amp; the garage, leading to a switch &amp; AP in the garage. The Raspberry Pi running hass.io will be in the garage in my office.

We've also got plans for an automated garden between the garage and the house. So do I have anything to worry about going with Z-Wave? I was thinking I'd basically put two Z-Wave outlets in the outdoor outlets of the garage &amp; the house to make the jump, there is reasonably line of sight other than a few trees.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I want to get my mother in law a robot vac but sheâs utterly useless with technology. You know the drill- if her chromecast stops working she has to wait until I next visit to press the reset button. 

This is not helped by her living in another country, me only visiting twice a year and her English (although conversationally fine) not being up to any level of technical chat whatsoever. 

With all that in mind Iâm debating what robot vac to get her. Iâm trying to decide between the roomba 960 and the Roborock s50. 

I know the s50 will clean slightly better and has better navigation, but the app is more complex and sheâll definitely get lost in it, so a dormant robot that cleans well is worse than an active robot that cleans less well. 

A lesser concern is that parts and accessories for iRobot are more widely available and cheap as hell, whereas Iâve never had a Roborock so not sure if theirs are as plentiful. 

What do you reckon? Speke yor branes.

The intended effect is the camera turns on when i go to bed and turns off when i get up.

Currently, this is achieved through tasker posting a notification and then IFTTT seeing that notification and flipping on/off the smart plug through Smart Life.

Now if im being honest, I find IFTTT **severely** slow and unreliable. As an example, i also have an IFTTT script that turns on the same camera when i disconnect from my wifi and turns it off when i reconnect. This only fires about 50% of the time, and 50% of that time it fires hours later after the event occurred. 

So ideally, I would like to completely remove IFTTT from any scripts that I consider important. This means I need to be able to toggle smart plugs through tasker.

ckcw0w,1564600064,Ring Pro Chime extenders don't create mesh network? Question/PSA/Rant,"I am pretty disappointed with Ring after what i went through recently. I had used their doorbells a few times and they were a breeze to install and program but recently installed some ring flood lights, doorbell video pro, and 3 chime extenders.  The whole experience was terrible. 

The house only had one router/access point which I was aware of but I thought the chime extender pros would take care of that and I got 3 thinking there would be no way I would need them all. I was wrong.

For some reason I thought they would do what most mesh routers do and talk to each other, but it turns out they only talk to the router and they don't extend the signal beyond that to the next chime pro.  Not only that, they don't seem to have nearly the range of a regular access point and about 20-30 feet is all you can expect.   It doesn't even come close to something like an Orbi.  

It was pretty ridiculous because the Comcast router was in the middle of the house in the pantry (don't ask me, I don't know) and I set up the chime pros close by and then moved them to their final location and they would not connect after 20 feet. Mind you, this was a wide open area. No concrete in the middle, but I'd put one on one end of the living room and the other one would not connect on the other side of the living room where I had some ring pro flood lights on the outside wall. 

Not only that, because during setup a front doorbell video got interrupted, it got locked up and no amount of factory defaulting would make it go back to setup mode again so I had to buy another one which setup ok.  Returning the other one also took an hour on the phone and they still aren't sure they can do it. 

 Anyway, my PSA if you want to add ring pro stuff is make sure your wifi is solid. I mean really good outside.  Have hard wired access points, mesh routers, or whatever else you need to do because these extenders are very weak and you can't put 2 or 3 of them in a straight line.

Now that âWorks with Nestâ is being discontinued on 8/31, I now have little hope of the various components will eventually upgrade in capability and integration to allow my above dream of a killer app for an integration as above.

I am tempted but then I will need to have some matching dimmers / switches in place and that probably means dumping the PDL Iconic range.

I will probably go with the dumb lights and PDL switches as the switches look good and they have upgradable 'mechs' inside them which bode well for future proofing the house.

Question 2. As many people are aware of, in the beginning of the gameplay there are some touch screens that do different things such as opening the window blinds (and I'm sure many more things). Is it possible to install something like that in a wall or maybe something simular to interact with? An example being, installing an interactive touch screen device in the wall of your sleeping area?
