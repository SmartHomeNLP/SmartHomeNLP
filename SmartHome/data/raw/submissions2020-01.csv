I have Hue and I like them, just budget is tighter than it was when I started at it, and one of the bulbs went out. While I could afford replacing it with a new Hue bulb, I'm trying to be price conscious and hear good about the Eufy bulbs. Is there an issue with a Google Home controlling a room with a mix of Eufy and Hue? Outside of IFTT is there anything Eufy really can't do that Hue can?

( https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Webhooks )

I'm technical and generally prefer to run stuff on-premise rather than in the cloud, so would prefer a bulb or bulb system that isn't locked into a cloud only account (like some security cams are). I have a server that can run a ""hub"" or centralized management software to control them, and have them talk to Emby.

eikgwx,1577897765,Best way to have both smart bulbs and switches?,"Hi,

Pretty new to the idea of home automation, and looking to start off in the right direction.  I only have smart bulbs right now, but would like more in the future (thermostat, locks, garage door, etc).

My current obstacle is that I can't decide on the right solution to allow for both smart bulbs and lights.  I like the smart bulbs ability to control color (mainly used for dimming &amp; changing color temperature) but it's inconvenient that a switch can no longer be used.  All the smart switches I've found can be controlled in smart ways, but still just turn the connected loads on/off by cutting power.

My current idea is to bypass the switches and have all lights always powered, install smart switches that I can get the status of, and use a hub to turn lights on or off depending on the status of the switch.   Is this really the best approach for what I want to do?  Also, if so, what hubs should I be considering?

I currently have these bulbs, and would like to keep them if possible:

eil9nw,1577901462,"Teckin, smartlife and a slight desire to destroy everything with a hammer"," Hello people, happy new year.

I've been starting to add smart products in my house, at the moment I have 3 dots, an amazon smart plug and 3 teckin rgb bulbs.

The smart plug (wifi) works like 99% of the times, but the teckin bulbs are getting me so frustrated that i'm considering to send them back, unless I can manage to find a solution. Basically they go offline very, VERY often. Sometimes all of them, sometimes just one or two.  
Sometimes they stay offline for a few minutes and come back by themselves, sometimes I have to switch them off and on from the physical wall switch to let them reconnect, sometimes they just go offline and never come back (and a couple times it took like 20 tries to reset and reconnect them because the app couldn't communicate with them...).

It is driving me crazy. The only reason I'm still here is that when they work it is amazing, I love the ability to controll the light, the color and scenes.  
But seriously, I can't understand what's wrong.  
I'm not a technician but I'd say I'm tech savy, and I really don't see a pattern.

My internet connection is not amazing (5-10 Mb/s, I live on the hills in north italy) but it's enough to stream movies on a couple devices simultaneously, I suppose the ""hey device, turn the f on"" message shouldn't be that heavy in terms of Kbs.

My router is the Fastweb FASTGate RTV1907VW-D228, everything is connected via wifi (smart stuff on the 2.4, pc and phones on the 5) but the problem is not the distance considering that the bulb closest to the router is the one that seems to never work.

Do you guys have any idea? Is it the slow internet? Bad router? Would I solve my issues with bulbs running on zigbee or zwave through a hub?

I have a couple of devices(audio system,TV,Android set top box) that have remotes(IR 38Khz)  and I have some devices that I understand they use RF (433Mhz) remotes (old power plugs and the garage door) .

I was looking for something else on Amazon when I came across this universal RF/IR remote:

&amp;#x200B;

The only issue is that it does not have fantastic reviews for the price. Also I am not clear if the garage opener (I think it is an old Chamberlain LiftMaster 1/2HP) works with the stadard RF frequence or I need a dedicated bridge toward WiFi for that.

eisc9k,1577934437,Some dimmable LED bulb reviews for fellow Lutron Caseta PD-6WCL owners.,"**TL;DR: Ecosmart '50w' LED bulbs are actually amazing with Caseta dimmers if you are fine with a consistent color temperature, otherwise the Philips Warm Glow '45w' look WAY nicer at lower light levels, even if they don't dim nearly as low as the Ecosmarts.**

So I read all these bad things about dimmable LEDs in these Caseta dimmers: flickering, noise, poor dimming range, not instant on and so I've stayed away from them until today.

Basically, because the Caseta does not require (and cannot use) a neutral wire, it needs a higher base load on the switch to work properly... or something... I'm not an electrician. Well, I saw a review that mentioned that if you actually have multiple lights on one dimmer, as I think probably a decent number of Caseta dimmer users do, then they combine to give a good enough load to operate with fewer issues.

With this in mind, I headed to home depot today and bought a bunch of bulbs to test with. This wasn't not COMPLETELY scattershot, as I had narrowed down some recommendations with [Lutron's product selection tool](http://www.lutron.com/en-US/Service-Support/Pages/Technical/Design-SelectionTools/LEDDimmerMatrix.aspx).

Mostly the bulbs that they recommended didn't have model numbers that lined up exactly with what I was staring at in Home Depot but they gave me a target for my R20 track lights. I went with some [Ecosmart 50w soft white \(2700k\) dimmable bulbs](https://www.homedepot.com/p/EcoSmart-50-Watt-Equivalent-R20-Dimmable-Energy-Star-LED-Light-Bulb-Soft-White-3-Pack-1003024502/303849915) (1001 655 257) and the [75w version of the same bulb](https://www.homedepot.com/p/EcoSmart-75-Watt-Equivalent-BR20-Dimmable-Energy-Star-LED-Light-Bulb-Soft-White-3-Pack-1003020502/303667905). I also picked up some [Cree 75w dimmable bulbs](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Cree-75W-Equivalent-Soft-White-2700K-R20-Dimmable-Exceptional-Light-Quality-LED-Light-Bulb-TR20-09827FLFH25-12DE26-1-11/304006395?keyword=849665021704&amp;semanticToken=20330000111_202001012152421220066_1bsf+20330000111+%3E++cnn%3A%7B0%3A0%7D+cnr%3A%7B7%3A0%7D+cnd%3A%7B4%3A0%7D+cne%3A%7B8%3A0%7D+cnb%3A%7B0%3A0%7D+cns%3A%7B5%3A0%7D+cnx%3A%7B3%3A0%7D+st%3A%7B849665021704%7D%3Ast+oos%3A%7B0%3A1%7D+dln%3A%7B541989%7D+qu%3A%7B849665021704%7D%3Aqu) and some of the [Philips 45w dimmable 'warm glow' dimmables](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Philips-45-Watt-Equivalent-R20-Dimmable-LED-ENERGY-STAR-Light-Bulb-Soft-White-with-Warm-Glow-Light-Effect-1-Bulb-545020/310569662).

One caveat, my ceilings are like 14ft high, so if there is noise, I'm afraid that's one thing I can't rate. Also, these are all R20 bulbs, so I can't speak to anything beyond that.

Okay, here's the quick breakdown:

* Cree 75w - nice and bright but they had a VERY high activation threshold and wouldn't dim down low at all.

* Ecosmart 75w - also nice and bright but had the same issue as the Cree

* Ecosmart 50w - okay, these were actually fantastic. They had a VERY low activation threshold and could dim WAY down, very competitive with the halogens I had in, in that regard. They were also very bright at max, definitely brighter than the 50w halogens that I had in. 

* Philips 45w - they actually turned on at a very low threshold, like the Ecosmart 50w, so basically instantly BUT... they were might brighter than the Ecosmart 50w bulbs at their lowest. In terms of max brightness, I think they were slightly dimmer, but that would track, as I think they're a '45w' bulb vs a '50w'.

I thought we had it all set with the Ecosmart 50w but when it got dark out and we turned them down, we realized that 2700k seems kinda cold at low light levels in our place. The philips have that 'warm glow' thing where they go from 2700k at max brightness down to 2200k at dimmest, which is supposed to ape what halogens do naturally as they dim and while it's not EXACT, it was definitely close enough that I switched out all the Ecosmarts for the Philips.

So yeah, I'm definitely up for other recommendations but it was hard enough finding really concrete info out there that I figured it'd be worth making a post.

Does such a thing even exist? I've asked this question elsewhere but all I get in answer are the type of wall switch that I am explicitly not looking for.

I'd even accept a hybrid system where the wall switches are Z-wave and communicate with something like a Samsung SmartThings hub that can (so I am told) interface with Philips Hue, or a Wink hub that can do both Z-Wave and ZigBee.

Is there any solution to prevent this annoying downside of having everything separated? Thanks a lot.

My actual setup (will draw.io soon):

eix5ig,1577964752,Newbie Tasmota Setup,"Hi All,

I am new to Home Automation and have decided to take a plunge into this field. I am a network engineer by trade so have a good understanding of IT.

I have recently done some research on Tasmota firmware and from a security point of view I prefer standalone open-source firmware which is non-reliant on the cloud.

I have purchased couple item for my starter kit to get me started.

1. Amazon Echo Flex - I want to integrate this with Hassio to control  by voice commands
2. x2 Flashable smart plugs (I found while researching [https://templates.blakadder.com/uk.html](https://templates.blakadder.com/uk.html))
3. a smart door sensor
4. Raspberry Pi running volumio which will connect to my USB DAC AMP

I have an orange Pi Zero, which I have flashed with Armbian and installed Hassio. The rest of the kit above is on its way.

I wanted to ask how easy is it to set up the above. For example to integrate Tasmota devices with Hassio.

I have done the following so Far on my orange PI Zero:

1. Installed and Setup Hassio
2. installed MQTT Broker Add-on
3. Installed TASMOadmin

Once the smart plugs arrive I will flash with Tuya convert, I guess its just the case of entering IP details of Hassio and MQTT broker and auth details.

The devices will then appear in Hassio to be controlled ?

I would like to do the following:

Once flashed smart plugs with Tasmota, have them setup with Hassio to control a floor lamp on a time scheduler to turn on and off.

Do the same with the second smart plug for a box fan

Also, set up the smart door sensor to trigger the smart led build to turn on, when I eventually buy the lights. And also if possible send email alerts when someone enters while away from home.

If you have any examples or guidance for a newbie like me or anything I might be missing. It will be much appreciated.

Lastly I have seen some IR bridge sensors to control TV, receivers etc [https://templates.blakadder.com/eachen-IR-DC6.html](https://templates.blakadder.com/eachen-IR-DC6.html)

Once flashed with Tasmota is there a way to control these IR bridge sensors without the native iOS/Android Apps.(I dislike Chinese based apps which send details to unknown servers)

Ideally I would like to consolidate all my remotes into once, but without having to use proprietary Chinese based apps.

Is there something that is open-source app for iOS/Android that I can use and compatible with Alexa/Hassio ?

It doesn't have to be Hassio controlled but it would be ideal. As long as its open-source and has large database of IR device codes for compatibility.

If I leave color control just in the app with a single 0-10v controller for the white channel, the app can override any input, right?

Seems with wireless z-wave control so long as the smart bulb has power you should be able to control the on/off of ANY ""smart"" light in your house from a completely wireless (powered by 120v) controller instead of a switch that is reliant on standard wiring.  


Short of mounting a tablet to the wall, is this an option? Something that looks like a light switch and turns lights on or off.

I was wondering if you guys could help! I have one Google Home Nest (Not the Big One) and Two Home Minis (1 1st Gen and 1 2nd Gen). Here are the some issues that I am having. 

&amp;#x200B;

1.  When I stream on Spotify or NPR, it sometimes appears to get stuck on any of the speakers, like it is buffering but when I change to new content, seems to function fine.  Further, it also seems to sometimes get stuck at a specific time spot on NPR almost daily but again, when switching to the next news content (even video) works fine. Could this just be an internet issue? The speakers that are closer to the AP appear to still have the issue. 

2. One of the light switches appears to work fine with the voice command but does not function as part of a routine. All the other devices seem to function fine as part of a routine. 

3. How well does a Sonos 1 Interact with Google Home.. does it work well? Any other speaker that you can recommend that would work well and still have excellent sound quality? 

4. Any other cool hardware or ideas that I may not know about that are worth checking out? Any word on when Netflix will start working on the Nest?

Ten of my home's switches are Intermatic HA20Cs dimmers which were picked up for &lt;$15 a piece when Intermatic decided to close out of their z-wave line. I‚Äôm now looking to move to LED bulbs which means that I need to replace my old Z-wave dimmer switches.

**I‚Äôm trying to decide on if I should replace with smart switches or smart modules.** Since the majority of my home is 3- or 4-way setups, I want to avoid anything that requires me to replace every switch in the setup with add-on switches.

Is there a general consensus on if smart dimmer switches or smart dimmer modules is the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù approach?

I currently use on/off modules in places where I don‚Äôt need dimming capability but I have never used a dimmable module. My understanding is that I‚Äôd loose the ability to dim at the switch unless I also replace the switch with a momentary contact switch. This would add to my cost but I can see eventually adding momentary contact switches to places where I feel I want dimming capability without needing to ask Alexa or Google. Can I mix and match momentary switches with standard switches in a module setup?

Other considerations:

* My entire home is toggle switches, which limits smart switch options. I could consider moving everything to decora/rocker switches but that would significantly increase my cost.
* My home is in the New Jersey, USA and was built in 2001. I have neutral wires but they are not always in the boxes where I would want to control dimming.
* I use openHAB so whichever solution I go with would need to be supported.
* I still have a number of old z-wave outlets and other things which are old z-wave. Will this cause many issues?

The house comes with a Ring doorbell, some Alexa devices, a SmartThings hub, a Honeywell vista panel, a Honeywell(?) WiFi thermostats, and a WiFi garage door system. So I‚Äôll likely use those ecosystems.  

The house has dumb switches and standard dumb pot lights everywhere.   There‚Äôs also prewired security but I‚Äôm not yet sure where the sensors are and how that may connect to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features. It has a modern central hub and switch for the Ethernet/coax wiring (all bedrooms, and various other rooms) and I think the speaker prewiring. 

I‚Äôm reasonably tech savvy but not terribly handy. 

Use case:  The Wife wants cameras inside in key places (basically nanny cam, and infant monitor).  I‚Äôm interested in home control and monitoring (eg lights, corralling my older boy if he get out of bed).  Also need external cameras for security.  

From what I‚Äôve read, the most bang for my buck is to go with smart switches where I‚Äôd like them  for now and smart bulbs in select places (did I mention pot lights everywhere?). The inovelli switches seem interesting because you can use them with smart and dumb bulbs if I want to later go the smart bulb route.  (I have an itch to play with color, brightness and time, but replacing all the bulbs would be ungodly expensive). Has anyone tried this approach? 

Internal and external cameras might be ring just to stay in the same ecosystem.  How are experiences with them? 

 I may splurge for a Brilliant panel.  It seems awesome.  Thoughts?

I know the issue is one of air flow in the home, but I'm renting and it's not worth it to try to get that systemic problem resolved. What I'm looking for is a smart thermostat that I can use not only to control when the heat and ac run, but also that allows me set the displayed temperature to either a different temperature sensor or to an average of several sensors.

I'm running SmartThings, Home Assistant and Node Red, and have a combination of Zigbee, Z-Wave and wifi products in the home, so almost any platform thermostat will work with my system. I could probably get remote sensors for Nest, but I'm reluctant to venture further into the ecosystem after what they did with the Works with Nest program.

Currently on Virgin Media, in a 4-bedroom detached house, but our network devices are always increasing and the standard router just isn't cutting it anymore. 

I work in IT, so I'd say I'm technically competent, but I don't want to run wires around the house so I am looking for more of a Plug &amp; Play solution. From everything I've read I _think_ I've narrowed it down to three options:

- Eero (only the `eero` and `eero pro` are available in the UK, no `beacon`).
- Nest Wifi
- Ubiquiti Amplifi
- Linksys Velop

And I'd say the following is what has driven my decision to narrow it down to those three:

- Ease of use. As I said above, I don't want to run cables through the house. I don't mind some initial set-up/configuration, but ultimately I just want to be able to plug them in and bask in their glory. 

- Speed. Obviously, I want to invest in a mesh network so I can actually utilise my 100Mbp/s throughout the house. 

- Features. I don't need the ability to tweak the network in a massive way; I do have a young daughter so having the ability to ""kick"" devices off the network and set ""downtimes"" is a useful thing to have (I think the Nest Wifi offers this), but not mandatory. 

I know the Ubiquiti Unifi is loved here, but I don't want the hassle of another server or running cables.

ejjwfk,1578077959,Controlling smart plugs,"Hi all,

Asking a question for a friend to maybe find an answer or a different idea. 

So he has all his lights in him and his gfs bedroom on smart plugs now so they can easily turn them on and off via Google home and Alexa.

His gf doesn't like walking into a dark room and having to tell the system to turn the lights on (I'm sure y'all know Home and Alexa both have a decent sized delay) and she doesn't think to tell the system while she is on the way to the room either. 

So we are thinking a motion sensor to put inside the room to trigger the lights. Only problem being they ONLY use Google Home and Alexa right now and have no kind of automation hub. 

So are there motion sensors that will work purely through Google home or Alexa that you can also have trigger only during certain times (they don't want the lights turning on in middle of the night in case they get up, etc)?

If anyone has alternate or better ideas in lieu of a motion sensor then that would be cool too. 

Thanks in advance!

PS. My suggestion to him is to get an integration solution/hub set up like Home Assistant or OpenHAB and then he can have so much more flexibility.

I need help with what smart home devices to buy.

I am helping my father in law set up a system in his house that would notify him when either of the kids bedroom doors open and a camera that would monitor the driveway. 

I have mainly been looking at the Samsung system for this but the camera options are quite limited from what I saw. Mainly looking at the Arlo outdoor cameras and don't like the fact that it would need it own hub.

I also started looking at the Google nest system, but I am having trouble finding magnetic door sensors that would work with it.

Any advice would be great, in summary looking for a system that would support multiple magnetic door sensors and outdoor cameras that could be used without a subscription service.

I own the Xiaomi Robot Vacuum. I really like it, it does a good job at vacuuming, the path finding is very good, overall I‚Äôm pretty satisfied except for one thing - I can‚Äôt set no-go zones.

I live in a shared house, so I do not want the vacuum to go into other people‚Äôs private spaces, or into the cable nest in the lounge. But my vacuum has no ability for no-go zones, so every time I want to run the vacuum I have to manually draw zones for a zoned cleanup. That also means that I can‚Äôt schedule cleanups, because by default the vacuum will clean the entire house (side note: if anyone has a workaround or a fix for this, I‚Äôd be very grateful). 

Main question: my partner‚Äôs mother found out I have a robot vacuum and now she really wants one. I‚Äôm trying to find one that has the no-go feature that mine sorely lacks. The Roborock S4 looks promising however I can‚Äôt find it for sale in my country (New Zealand). The S5 and the S6, I don‚Äôt need the mopping feature and they are a bit too expensive ($800 and $1000 ea in my country) though I could probably stretch to that if needed.

ejn4oh,1578091424,Question About Removing X10 Light,"Hopefully someone can help me out. I bought a house and there is a light that is about 20 feet up on the ceiling. This light has no wall switch but there is an X10 panel that plugs into an outlet that controls it. The problem is that this light keeps turning on or off when ever it feels like it. 

I'm trying to figure out the easiest strategy for removing this setup, and I'm hoping someone can advise on which setup is most likely. There is obviously some controller in the light. I'm just not sure if that controller would be in the box in the ceiling where the light connects, or if it would be outside of that box in the attic above it. If it's in the box, then I am going to have to get some kind of scaffolding to get up to the darn thing. And if it is in the attic then I have to crawl around in some deep insulation. I have to do one or the other, but I'm hoping to just do one. I don't want to rent a bunch of scaffolding and set it up only to find out the controller is in the attic or something.

Can anyone with X10 experience advise on where the controller is likely to be for this light? Maybe an alternative way of dealing with it? Any advice would be appreciated.",mickeyknoxnbk,/r/homeautomation/comments/ejn4oh/question_about_removing_x10_light/,2,homeautomation,4

I'm trying to plan out to setup devices for my home (construction pending) and I understand to try and wire as much as possible. I suspect I'll use a lot of smart switches/sockets with some devices controlling power going to wires from the electrical panel. I also want sensors around the house for temperature, humidity, light and motion. 
I was wondering about power efficiency of these devices. They will be on 24/7 and obviously use power. The question is which use the least in particular at idle waiting for commands. Any brands or class? I was thinking of using home assistant since hubitat is unshippable where I live and they don't support 2nd hand sales.

FYI our mains is 240V 50Hz (pretty much a mix of UK 13A and eu plugs 16A)

As a side question are there savings to be made using a different gauge wire or some specific wire for stuff like AC units and fridges and other appliances that use a lot of power?

ejvq3i,1578138277,wired multisensor = what and how?,"Hi everybody,

I am using `Home Assistant` as my smarthome hub and have mostly `Xiaomi` zigbee sensors all over the house (door/window, temperature, motion, some water leak sensors, vibration sensors for the windows). While `zigbee2mqtt` works fine, some devices get randomly disconnected, and that sometimes messes up my automations; for example, the living room has three windows, and an automation monitoring all of those for their status; if (any of them) is open =&gt; radiators off, if all of the shut =&gt; turn radiators to heat. This only works when all three sensors are connected, though. The ""middle"" window sensors sometimes disappears and won't send updates until manually pushed. This defeats the purpose of automation, though.

More details below, but first my criteria:

* connect via *ethernet*
* send payload for each of these sensors via `mqtt`
  * open/closed (reed)
  * motion (radar and/or PIR)
  * vibration (to be attached to the window)
   * *at least* temperature (ideally temperature, humidity, pressure in one sensor)
* **ideally** flash an existing firmware to the device that provides connectivity to all sorts of sensors/actors¬π

¬π I am currently using a lot of `tasmota` flashed devices as well as `ESPHome`; these are made for wifi, though. I believe at least `ESPHome` allows to connect an ethernet board, but then I'd run it *on* an `ESP8266` or `nodeMCU` (which is made for wifi), *not* use the wifi, and have to buy an additional ethernet board for each device.

Hardware-wise

* which microcontroller to use??? (I have minimal experience with those; I can copy,paste,modify code, but will not be able to program complex structures by myself)
* does it come with ethernet? *if not*, which ethernet board/shield to connect to it???
* is there any existing firmware I could use???
  * ideally it would integrate with Home Assistant
  * if not, it should allow me to customize the `mqtt` payload structure, so that I could simple modify it in a way that Home Assistant could auto-discover it

I am planning to have one of these devices per window/door. This is because I need each window/door open/closed status for radiator control... I figured instead of building multiple different devices, they should all be capable of supporting at least those sensors mentioned above; if I don't need some values, I don't have to use them, but building 50 (for example, don't have that many doors/windows ;)) devices the exact same way seems easier to me than making minor changes for each device and it's purpose...

Both the wifi solution (`tasmota`, `ESPHome`) generally work fine for me. `zigbee2mqtt` has some bugs (or I configured it poorly) that disconnect some devices randomly that should not disconnect. The example from above, the living room ""middle"" window, disconnects, while the other two windows do not... that doesn't make sense to me, as neither distance, nor objects in the way can be responsible for this (because the other two windows are technically further away from that sensor; also, there is another zigbee sensor a few feet below that one (if any, that should be the one with poorer reception), that works fine constantly).

What do you suggest I use for hardware and software? I don't have ethernet in each room yet, but I am planning to slowly expand it room by room; each room will get a double ethernet connection as well as a ""dumb"" (not managed) switch, so I'll have more ports to work with, but don't have to run 6 or 7 wires from the tech room to every other room; also, I'll **not** run wires from the tech room to each room altogether, but rather first to the closest rooms, then extent from those rooms to the other  ones (via the switch). This might not be the best solution, but I don't have drywall (everything is made off solid bricks), which means it'd be a bitch running all that wire...

Looking for some collective wisdom... I did try and search here first but found nothing readily apparent. 

I‚Äôm establishing an Alexa controlled smart home, and during planning, I‚Äôm trying to decide how to handle our dumb ceiling fan. Will be adding a remote control to it and then using the Bond device to send it to Alexa, however I‚Äôm undecided what to do with the wall switch. It‚Äôs a single pole toggle, cutting power to the entire ceiling fan unit (vs discrete fan and light). I‚Äôm thinking of hardwiring the wall switch so it‚Äôs always on - as I would be using either the remote or Alexa to control the on/off of the light and fan. I can‚Äôt see a purpose of wanting a wall switch in this situation as well. Am I not thinking of a situation where the wall switch would still be beneficial ?

I have used Sonoff POW 16A switches  in my 2 bathrooms for a couple of years now. They both turn on the storage heaters for the showers for 20 minutes each morning &amp; each evening.
240V, 8.7 amps approximately.


Last week we noticed a burning smell from one bathroom but it took me a few days to track it down as the switch is in the ceiling space in the bathroom.

Seems the incoming live connection wasn't seated perfectly &amp; overheated but it took a couple of years to go bad. Even with the overheating, the water heater was still working fine until I removed the Sonoff.

ejz1z5,1578157016,Controlling LIFX and Philips Hue Lights Together,"So I got deals on a pair of LIFX A19 bulbs and a Philips Hue starter kit (3 rgbw bulbs, hub and physical switch). This is my first time using smart lights so I wanted to try both brands. 

Right away I like how bright the LIFX bulbs are and the colors are amazing to me. Its nice that they don't need a hub but I know they are really pricey without any sales. The Philips Hue lights are also great. They don't get as bright but I haven't noticed much difference in colors vs LIFX. 

I'm controlling both with Google Assistant but it has to be separately, I can't turn them on/off or change colors at the same time. I need to use IFTTT to change the LIFX colors for some reason, as Google Assistant won't let me (despite resetting bulbs and syncing). 

Is there a way to control LIFX &amp; Philips Hue lights together with one command? Or am I doomed to use both separately? If so, I may either return LIFX and go all in with Philips Hue if I can't think of another use for LIFX.

It's all really beyond my abilities at this time: financial, time, and experience.

A simpler solution just came to mind that would eliminate any need for a home automation hub.  I don't need a central brain, each blind could work independently and wired to control its own raise/lowering by simply having a prob near the window and one on the headrail.  If I can program a desire temp range then it can decide for itself if it should raise or lower itself for that goal.

ejzclr,1578158320,failing GE z-wave switches,"This is a rant as I am not happy with the lifespan of the GE z-wave light switches I bought a few years ago (December 2017).  I replaced over 14 light switches in my house (some are the add-ons) with GE Z-Wave smart light switches.  They worked fine with a Wink Hub controlling them (and more recently, now controlled by a Hubitat - not that the hubs matter).  

About 4 months ago, the first one failed causing a strobe light effect in my office.  I replaced it.  

One of the switches in my kitchen died next - again a wild strobe light effect.  Wife was not happy about this one as I had to wait a few days to repair and we had a poorly lit kitchen until I was able to replace it.

A week after the kitchen switch, our master bedroom died.  Same problem.  Replaced it.  (Also, wife not happy as getting dressed in a dim bedroom is challenging.)

After the bedroom, I did order a few backups (Leviton this time).  

Today, I noticed one of the add-on GE switches in my basement is no longer working.  The master and the other slave still work.  Sigh...ordering a replacement.

To top it all off, my GE gas oven decided to have a circuit board failure on Christmas Eve.  Just in time to cook (or not) that Christmas roast.  The oven was about 6 months out of warranty.  Sorry, this is not a smart related product - but it is another GE failure in my house.

I guess I should expect the rest of the GE switches to fail soon.  They were installed the same weekend.  They are dropping like flies.  I think this is very poor quality and am likely going to avoid buying GE products going forward.  I probably spent between $400-500 for these switches.

Any idea if the Jasco or Honeywell switches are any better?  I was under the impression they were all manufactured by the same company and basically just sold in different packaging.",Steakman1971,/r/smarthome/comments/ejzclr/failing_ge_zwave_switches/,1,smarthome,13

ek47aa,1578179601,Please help a smart home beginner!,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I started another thread but I figured I'd put all my questions in one place. I've started my smart home empire and am in love with the possibilities, but I have gotten a little confused and need help. Here is my current setup:

&amp;#x200B;

Google Home Hubs/Home Mini's

Nest E Thermostat

Nest x Yale lock (just installed today, still playing around with it)

About 8-10 C by GE indoor light bulbs (I guess my light switches weren't wired right to install smart switches, so this was the next best thing)

The free smart plug that came with the 4-pack of GE bulbs at Best Buy

2 Philips Hue outdoor lights for the back deck  (with the Bridge)

Samsung Smart TV, Samsung smartphone and Samsung Galaxy Watch

&amp;#x200B;

So I've got everything set up and am in love. I love being able to set up custom commands and tell Google to turn on and off lights, adjust the thermostat, etc. Most of the time I want to use voice commands but when I use my phone to control stuff, I want one app for everything, preferable Google Home app. My questions:

&amp;#x200B;

* I want to be able to turn on/off my Smart TV, adjust volume, etc. I've tried out Smartthings for the TV but it only lets me turn off the TV from on, not the other way around. In addition, we use a soundbar for audio from the TV so the volume control doesn't do anything. Is there any way to finagle everything where I can tell Google ""turn on/off the TV"" or ""adjust volume""? Super bonus points if I can fire up Youtube TV app on the TV itself (the app is built in to the TV, not through a stick or anything). Would I need the Smartthings Hub perhaps to allow me to control the TV when off, or control the soundbar as well?
* What the heck is the difference between Bluetooth smart bulbs and Wifi smart bulbs? I didn't know there was a difference until my C by GE bulbs hooked up fine but my Philips Hue outdoor lights required me to get the Bridge to connect them to my Google system.  It made me very confused since there was no bridge or hubs needed for the NEst products so i don't know the benefits or drawbacks of each.
* I use routines a lot for when I get home and leave, and I use Android Auto when I'm driving. According to a quick Google search Routines + AA has been at the top of the wish list for a while, anyone know if it's coming or any workarounds?
* I'm still playing around with the Nest Lock, but from what I understand due to security there's no way to *unlock* the door with a voice command, but you can lock it. No big deal. We have people come over to the house from time to time to check on our dogs, so is it possible to set up custom codes for Mom/Dad/ etc and track each time the lock opens up who it was/what code opened it? Part 2: can I set the Google Routines to the Nest lock so if I use my code to unlock the door that will trigger a routine to turn on lights or thermostat?
* I gave up trying to integrate my Galaxy Watch's Bixby to the smart home stuff and instead found the workaround to get Google Assistant on the watch. It works for individual commands (turn on/off X light) but not my routines. Anyone know a fix or workaround to that?
* This is a strange one but when I'm telling one Google Home device (or my phone's Google Assistant) to turn off the screen on a Google Home Hub, it doesn't work. Anyone know how or why?
* We have Spectrum for internet (cuz monopolies) and it has a 2.4GhZ and 5GhZ network for us. When I set up new devices only one is visible to connect to, not sure which one though. We have one router for both of the networks, is there any advantage to getting all smart devices on one network and all phones/laptops on the other, or just put everything on one and get rid of the other? We're trying to figure out of Google Wifi has any benefits over a regular router. We have a coax input from the wall so I believe we'd have to either keep the router and plug the Wifi into that or trade the router for a modem and then connect the Wifi to that. Anyone have input on the benefits or drawbacks?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my end goal is to use voice commands and the Google Home app for everything (or as much as I can), and use the Nest/GE/Phillips/Smartthings apps as little as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is able to understand my madness, is any of this possible or do I need to just accept reality and work with my limitations?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: One more question on the thermostat. We have it set up where if we're ""Away"" the temp goes to ""Eco Mode"" which is 60, and when we're home it's 68. It works when we are ""Away"", but when I tell Google ""I'm Home"", it seems like it makes me manually go in and shut ECO mode off. Is there a workaround or should I just leave ECO mode off and set the away temp at 60 (without Eco Mode being on) and the home temp at 68?

Edit 2: How do I manage ""Home/Away Mode"" with the routines? My main concern is I want to set up an auto-lock on the Nest Lock after X minutes, except when we're marked as Home. If I tell Google ""I'm heading out"" can that put the home in ""Away"" mode automatically so that the door will auto-lock at the designated time? And when I'm ""Home"" it won't do the auto-lock?",cavanaughnick,/r/homeautomation/comments/ek47aa/please_help_a_smart_home_beginner/,7,homeautomation,15

Is there another way of achieving this. I was looking into Mopidy on raspberry PI as it has alot more integration with gmusic and soundcloud, which would make my music experience better as i have accounts with those services.
But i would like to avoid paying additional subscriptions considering im already paying for spotify premium

In 2020 me and my gf is probably moving out of this apartment, and into a house, yay us!
Anyway, I'm already planning on how the house should be automated with sensors, gadgets, displays and what else.
But I'm a big fan of the Automation part of this, that means that most of our daily tasks should be automated, not started p√• a switch, and app, or even a smart dashboard somewhere on the wall, everything should just react to us, automatic!

I know this means building a lot of sensors, data points and all that, but well, I pretty much know what I want in that department, and how to do it! ;-)

What I need help with, is the platform on which everything shall be working together.
I want 3 parts to my platform:

1. Datalogging, maybe some kind of database?
2. Platform to make rules and sensors react to one another
3. A place to view data, if I need to see temps from a year back

Everything I use shall be replaceable, I'm not planning on switching anything out, but you never know with software these days...
That means I will be able to take my data elsewhere, and setup another system to use it. (I know that you can never say that I will be able to do that, but no closed proprietary software).

I've researched and tried a bit of software out over the last couple of months, and so far, what I've found, that should be able to fulfill my needs are the following:

1. Influxdb as database for historical data
2. Home Assistant to make the rules to automation
3. Grafana to view data from Influxdb

As far as I've read, I should be able to set up Home Assistant in a way, that it actually writes data into Influxdb, so I won't need another service like Telegraf to collect data?
Everything will be build on its own VLAN, so that it won't have access to the big bad web.
And every service will be build on its own docker container.

Please, tell me if I'm completely off track, if I need any adjustments, maybe you got suggestions to some other software I would love? 
All input will be greatly appreciated!

And yes, I know that I need some other service til collect data from my endpoints, and from those interested, it'll be build using Arduino and and some sort of mqtt protocol, might change though when I begin testing.",sDyberg,/r/homeautomation/comments/eki766/home_assistant_influxdb_grafana_correct_solution/,2,homeautomation,8

I am looking for components for my Home Automation system (based on Google HA for now) . I already asked around about smart bulbs and now I am trying to find a solution for curtains or smart blinds

I set my eyes on ZemiSamart brand with their  Motorized Smart Curtain.  
Are there any other reliable and cost effective brands that you would recommend?

**Smart Blinds**  
On the Smart blinds side I have looked at the Ikea solution which is prohibitive. Any other out of the box solution seems also prohibitive compared with Smart Curtains. I am thinking going the DIY way, ZemiSmart also has affordable tube motors but I am not decided on what blind to buy and I have not researched the market to see what is available (price and finish/color etc) .

Any idea how I can fix this issue?

I recently installed an Inovelli Dimmer Red Series Gen-2 (seems to works well) paired with a GE Auxiliary (Gen 2 - amazon.com/dp/B07RQ8K25S).

&gt; **That Add-on / Auxiliary device does NOT work right now and that's my issue.**

I believe I followed all the instructions:

**1)** Wired The main Inovelli Dimmer following the PDF manuals

* https://inovelli.com/wp-content/uploads/LZW31-SN/LZW31-SN-Dimmer-Manual.pdf
* https://inovelli.com/wp-content/uploads/LZW31-SN/Wiring-Guide-Dimmers.pdf was also helpful to confirm the below Youtube videos

**2)** Wired the GE Auxiliary following this https://youtu.be/Xp4FWJRzHdo and this https://youtu.be/Fx1luE9llSQ (very helpful videos in my view)

**3)** The main Inovelli dimmer works and is paired to SmartThings

I followed these instructions for the handlers
https://inovelli.com/shop/smart-light-switches/zwave-smart-switches-gen2/z-wave-dimmer-switch-no-neutral-required-scenes-notifications/#installation-instructions

**4)** I followed this Inovelli video instruction to config the dimmer to Aux:
https://youtu.be/QzcQtrJwItg

*(I went back to the Dimmer + Aux, pulling them out of the wall the re-check the wires. It seems fine to me.)*

**5)** The ONLY difference from the wiring instructions is that the main Dimmer does not have a Ground wire attached to it, while the GE Auxiliary does have a Ground wire attached to it.

&gt; Question:

* What troubleshooting should I do?
* Is it because it is a GE Gen-2 Aux vs Gen-1?
* Is it because of the Ground Wire only at the Aux and not at main Dimmer?",bdrrr,/r/homeautomation/comments/ekkqb6/inovelli_dimmer_works_ge_auxiliary_gen2_doesnt/,1,homeautomation,3

ekpbme,1578287670,My own Home Automation server ramblings and thoughts. Suggestions and discussion welcome!,"First, not sure if PROJECT would be the right flair for this, or DISCUSSION, or IDEAS. Let me know if I should change it.

Hey all! I am in the planning phase of doing a Home Automation server build out, and would like some feedback from those of you who are more experienced. So far I have purchased an Ecobee ""new version"" or whatever the heck it's called that should have been Ecobee4+ or Ecobee5 or whatever. I've also been tinkering about with HAss.io/Home Assistant, and have been loving it over all so far.

I also plan to get some smart switches for lights and outlets, as well as a 6-8(ish) channel security camera system, some smart door locks, an electrical power monitor system of some kind, possibly some smart bulbs, and probably some other little things like garage stuff.

The big part is that I'd also like to build out a server for home automation and some minor web server tasks. I'm likely going to use some form of bare metal hypervisor for VMs, and I'm liking Hyper-V for that (because it's free and any of my win10 pro boxes can make/manage the VMs), but open to suggestions (familiar with Hyper-V, VirtualBox, and a little VMWare). I also know next to nothing about server hardware, but I have heard Supermicro makes some semi-decent lower cost stuff.

Unfortunately, the server form factor matters. I have a ""small"" 9U wall-mount network rack with my current network equipment that I also plan to stick the encoder (or whatever comes with the security cams to make them record to a system) and the server into. I've been gradually running cat6 for my home, so there's two patch panels, a 48-port switch, a dedicated hp thin client pfsense router, two modems, etc. I only have about 2U available for the server without removing modems and/or the router, which I'd prefer not to do. Also the depth is about 16-17 inches in this rack. So any space-conscious VM server suggestions would be great.

I'd also like to use a tablet to control my home stuffs - I have an old Kindle Fire, an original Google Nexus 7, and an Asus TF-101 with Windows 8 RT on it, all that could be repurposed. The TF-101 would be preferable, if possible, as it's just collecting dust, and the Nexus is old, slow, and likely somewhat broken, having been dropped seriously at least once by an ex. I also have a really old off-brand tablet running some super archaic generic Android (2.2), but it's basically trash and far too slow to do anything of value. I might consider wall board/PC options, but there isn't really a good spot in my house for that other than by the server rack, though I rarely go down to the basement... Maybe the bedroom? I don't know. A tablet just seems more convenient.

I'm leaning toward either August SmartLocks (non-pro) or Kwikset Kevo (and remove the key timber or something for security reasons) for the locks... though I'd really prefer a wired option over batteries, even if I have to hax it together with one of those. I'm not really sure what to do about the doorknob locks, but I suppose just a standard, non-lockable one should work?

I really don't like the look/feel of Lutron Caseta style switches/dimmers and push-button ones with remotes... I really prefer ""rocker"" decora style ones that have a tactile ""switch"" to them. Are there (m)any smart switches that are like this, or are they all push button types?

With regard to the power monitoring system, something that installs in the breaker box (200-amp GE) would be nice, but anything that will allow me to monitor branch circuit usage (power consumption, alerting, efficiency monitoring/logging, etc) will be considered, provided it can integrate with Home Assistant in some way.

I'd like everything I use to be as ecosystem agnostic or friendly as possible, in case a platform dies, or I decide to move to another one. I haven't seriously looked at any existing options other than noted here. I kind of want to try to stay away from DIYing most things simply because I don't have the time to invest in coding things for RasPi or Arduino and all that, but I *can* code if required.

I also have a Google Home Mini and a couple Fire TV devices (like the Cube that can control my TV a bit but not too well). Otherwise, it's a pretty ""dumb"" house so far haha!

Are there ""required"" smart home/home automation pieces I'm missing here? Special software that I may need other than Home Assistant?

ekqs8f,1578296297,Controlling the dimmer using Siri /w smart plug - question about use case,"Hi guys,

Long story short I'm on the market for an intelligent speaker, so I started looking at some home automation ideas. One of the possible choices is Apple Homepod, since both me and my wife are heavily into Apple ecosystem - 2x iPhone, iPad Pro, Macbooks, etc.

One thing I'm wondering about is the following use case - my living room lamp is connected to a dimmer switch that you operate with a foot. I was wondering if it was possible to buy a smart plug that can be controlled via Siri (I guess Apple Homekit) and allow me to regulate the dimmer, something like: 'Hey Siri, turn on the living room light at 50 percent'?

Anyone else set up this before? If so, which plug did you use?",castorkrieg,/r/homeautomation/comments/ekqs8f/controlling_the_dimmer_using_siri_w_smart_plug/,2,homeautomation,2

So does anyone know of a Hue compatible app that will allow me to do the following:

* Set smart plug to ON if temp is below 21¬∞C
* Set smart plug to OFF if temp is above 22¬∞C
* Have a timer that would override both, so I can turn it off completely while I'm at work and not have it turn back on even when the temp goes below 21¬∞C while I'm out.

ekvu3j,1578325720,Beginner starting out in smart homes and looking for suggestions about hubs and protocols,"Hi everyone! I recently got a google nest mini and am liking the little quirks that come with home automation so far. I know a bit about alexa and google assistant and decided to stay on the google home path, so I would prefer to use products that support google home/assistant.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so first, I'd like to figure out what type of smart home hub would work for me. I know that WI-FI, z-wave and zigbee are the protocols most used by various devices, and getting a hub would allow all these devices to communicate with each other, but for my specific use case I would need a hub that has an easy-to-use interface for my family who has trouble using most modern technology, and a device that can control devices if the wifi is spotty or goes down (if you have rogers internet in ontario, you know what i mean). I also don't really want to setup linux so that particular route is out of the question.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, which protocol would overall work better for me as a beginner? I know wi-fi is cheaper overall, but i know if the wifi goes down, you can't control your devices to their smart extents. I'm more looking at the difference between zigbee and z-wave and determining a) which one uses the least wi-fi, and b) which one works better overall if the power goes down, or based on latency towards smarthome control.

el598o,1578366408,Whole-Home Remote Water Shutoff and Draining,"I've got a cabin the the mountains that we visit semi frequently. I'm trying to automate one of the few things we have to do to open and close the house - turn the water on and off.

Except, its a bit more complicated than just the main. That's a relatively solved, buy it and you are done, home automation problem.

We turn the main off, open some ""main"" drain valves, that empty the hot and cold lines throughout the house down into the sewer, then go and open up (only for a second or two) a few sinks and showers at the edges of the house in order to relieve the vacuum so that the clean water backflows into the sewer.

Thus, after this routine, the main is off, the house line drains are open to the sewer, but all of our fixtures are closed. We don't let the house get cold enough that toilets would freeze, so we don't do antifreeze in the toilets or anything.

Given the number of ball valves in one room (4), I was looking at building a ardiuino based system, with a number of relays and [DC controlled quarter-turn auto-stop ball valves](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32960203891.html) to control that aspect of the system, with an ethernet shield and MQTT, and a HomeAssistant frontend. That part seems pretty easy, I think I've got it figued out pretty well, though I've yet to build it.

However, I'm looking for some thoughts on how to automate ""opening of the taps/showers"" in various locations, in order to relieve pressure. The hard part is, to be safe, it's got to be drained, unless I were to install some sort of one-way air valve, such that air can come in to drain the source, but water cannot come out.

Talking with a neighbor building a new house, he's building this into the showers themselves, with another DC ball valve, draining into the shower tub. Maybe this would be a better ask for /r/Plumbing, but figured I'd ask everyone here first.

Washing machine hookups are easy thoughts - got water, power, and an air-gap. I think in the kitchen it wouldn't be too hard to add an airgap - we've got a dishwasher, those usually have an airgap already!

Showers are basically a no-go as far as I can think, without tearing up the wall, and bathroom sinks might be a similar situation in order to get power.

Picked up an S4 over the holidays and the Nav and everything on it is amazing for sure. However, I'm having a bit of problems with the dust bin and brush (note, we have two fairly shedding dogs so not sure if that makes a difference).

The main brush gets stuck on 50% of the runs. It's a simple fix where I just have to grab the tangled hairs from under it and pull them out in a few places. Basically just big long hairs tied up tangled up under it. Additionally, it feels like the dust bin never fills all the way up. There's this huge compact rectangle of hair where the vacuum opening meets the dust bin and inside the bin itself all that hair is compacted into the same shape. Very rarely does the entire bin ever fill up because it seems like it's getting clogged and only using that opening space.

Is this normal for this? Do I just have the wrong vacuum for the dog/wife hair type at my house? I'm still overall happy with the purchase but it's annoying to have to babysit this thing all the time and I'm not sure if it's normal.

Hello, with so many devices connected to my router, my Internet has become painfully slow. 

I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for a WiFi router that can accommodate our ever increasing number of WiFi enabled devices, preferably under $250, but can go higher if recommended. I really appreciate any help (or criticisms), open to it all. If this isn‚Äôt the proper sub to ask please direct me to another one, thank you!

*DEVICES:*
4 Smart TVs, 5 Chromecasts, 2 Google Homes, Phillips Hue Bridge with 1 Hue Smart Light, Chamberlain smart garage door opener, 2-5 cell phones, 2-5 laptops, PlayStation, Alexa Input, Nuvelon Flare V speaker w/ Alexa. I‚Äôve tried to count them all, and ultimately determined we can have up to 20-25 devices connected to WiFi at any given time. 

*HOME:*
We live in a three-story town home, two permanent residents but at any time up to 3 Air BNB guests on the bottom floors. I‚Äôve factored guest devices into the numbers above.

The house is approximately 2,500 sq feet. The router is on the second floor. I‚Äôm finding that the third floor of the house and the garage on the bottom floor have very poor signal. 

*ROUTER &amp;amp; INTERNET:*
Spectrum Internet Ultra (300-400mbps as advertised, realistically only getting 8-11mbps download speed upstairs...you read that correctly).

Router: Netgear N300 2.4 GHz. Purchased 3 years ago when I lived in a small 750sq ft apartment with much fewer devices.

Thanks in advance for your time. I‚Äôm also open to recommendations for WiFi extenders or adaptors, router placement, etc. Any advice is appreciated.

*edit:* I installed my eero pro today. Truly shocking how much faster my internet is, and no dead spots. The slow spot upstairs which had a download speed of 11.5mbps just yesterday is now at 177mbps today.

I'm not an Alexa / Google Home kind of guy - I ultimately want to control my stuff with Linux scripts or a custom on-LAN webpage. It's important to me that my radio hardware doesn't ""phone home"" to some corporation's servers.

I've just about settled on Zigbee. My first buy will be Schlage Connect deadbolts, which come in Zigbee, Z-wave, or Wifi flavors. I could switch to another radio fabric if there was a better choice.

It looks like Samsung's SmartThings hub requires their phone app to set up the hub, and presumably doesn't work without the hub having access to their servers over the internet.

The only other hub I can seem to find is by a company I've never heard of: https://smile.amazon.com/AduroSmart-ERIA-Zigbee-Gateway-ZigBee/dp/B07HHKBGW8

Ultimately, I'm just looking to get Zigbee transmissions onto my computer network where I can locally get messages to/from them on a computer.

I have 2 indoor cats, and my problem is that I cannot use my garage door as I would like because they would escape.

So I have to leave the car, go inside my house, make my cats leave the garage, close the inside door of the garage, open the garage door, go inside the car again... and the same bullshit when I want to leave... As you can imagine it's a nighmare.

I'm wondering if there would be any way to solve this situation.

Maybe some way to make my cats move away from the garage, or a system to keep them away from the garage door when is open... I don't know... I guess somebody else is in a similar situation..

Once I ran the tuya convert script  i was able to see the vmtrusted network but when it was an open network and when I attempted to connect to it via my p20 pro it would open what looked like a captive portal window but nothing in the window would load for any kind of authorization. 

Prior to updating tuya convert I had successfully flashed 5 devices with the above setup except when I selected the vmtrusted network it was secured and allowed me to enter the flashmeifyoucan password. 

I needed to get my devices flashed so I just ended up opening them up and using the pins but I would like to rectify this issue as I‚Äôve got a couple more devices to flash that I‚Äôd prefer not to open.

I have an exhaust fan in my kitchen where I want to install a smart switch so I can set a schedule for it to run. Bestbuy had the TP-Link HS200 switches on sale, so I figured why not try it out. I have a couple of the smart plugs and haven't had an issue, and would like to keep using the same brand.

I pulled out the existing switch and it doesn't quite line up to what the instructions show, so I wanted to confirm with someone with more experience as to whats going on and if this switch will even work there. As you can see, the existing switch has the white/black wire, plus a red wire that splits into a skinny red/black.

The only thing I can think of is this exhaust fan is tied to the furnace? I seem to remember something like that brought up when we moved in that it had to be done. There is also a light switch on the side of my furnace, would this perhaps be a threeway switch?

I won an auction for a box of electricians parts off ebay mostly for the cable glands and other things I could see in the picture - Mostly just spares and repairs stuff - There was a thing in the box missing it's frontplate, which I discovered was an Emergency Exit Sign - I looked it up and they are pretty cheap - The one I have has 26 Led's mounted to the top of the box, a battery that charges to give 3 hours standby and even a test button on the underside.

I have just uploaded a stock photo from google but will upload the box itself if you click on the pico link and click to the 4th image it shows whats inside the box -

I always thought there would be 1 single lightstrip or fillament strip on these things but turns out LED couplets, there are 26 LED's in total at the top of this box, plenty of space with the only other things inside it a small circuit board on one side and the batteries on the other -

I'm thinking of breaking the LED strip up at the top, boxing it off into different sections and replacing the LED's with different colours and then plexiglassing a cover for the front, could just get some thin plastic or coloured plexiglass panels to match the boxes.

Anyway these things are cheap as chips it turns out, thought they would be mad expensive -

I was going to get into building a Nanoleaf or Hexagon style lighting system but think this could be a great way to get a modular lighting system off the ground, possibly smartified in some way as well.

Hi All,

I'm looking for new cameras to build a CCTV system. I'm planning to use motionOS and integrate into an existing HA envinronment once the CCTV part is setup. The HA solution is isolated from the internet, foreign cloud solutions are not possible. And because China cameras all run exclusively with their Crap Apps or worse crappier PC software nowadays, I cant seem to find what I'm looking for. And I hope you might be able to point me in the right direction.

Requirements:  
\- Full HD, better 4K capable  
\- Nightvision / IR (of course ;) )  
\- PoE  
\- Accessible by web browser locally  
\- ONVIF capable  
\- Must run locally without any internet connection.  


Absolute MUST NOT:  
\- Require internet connection  
\- Require an App  
\- Require a proprietary piece of Software  
\- Any sort of outside connection (especially to China)  


Ideally I'd be looking at some nice wideangle domes, one slightly more narrow angle dome. All outdoor of course. And if avaialble i'd take a PTZ outside dome with optical zoom if available, but thats optional.

I talked to two vendors, one of whom uses only KNX for their installations, and the other uses proprietary Lutron for the automation network and DALI for the lighting.

I am leaning towards KNX for the network, but the Lutron vendor says that KNX is insecure (a claim I find difficult to believe) and that he can enter the network in 30 minutes. He also claims that KNX lighting is hardwired and if you need to change the programming you have to change the wiring. This also sounds like BS.

empf5e,1578653816,smart sound setup in new house,"So we are in the process of buying a new house. which finally allows me space to implement proper automation (So expect multiple posts over the next few months.hehehe).  When you rent you are limited.

So one of the things I am thinking about is sound and music. Currently, I have a Logitech system in the living room for the TV.  Really nice, but dumb (doesn't even switch on automatically with tv, as the input is optical, not HDMI).And we use Alexa (echo dot) for our voice interface. Which we also use for playing the music (Logitech doesn't have Bluetooth. I added an adaptor/receiver, but it is a pain to change input the whole time).

So I am now trying to figure out a setup (that will not cost an arm and a leg). here are some of the goals I want to achieve. Probably all of them not right away, but my final goal (and in no order).

* some surround sound setup that will turn on with tv (this will also enable volume control via tv remote if I am not mistaken because currently need 2 remotes).  I think that if I make sure it has HDMI input (and HDMI-CEC) it should work right?  anything else I need to look out for?  possible Alexa integration?
* I want a setup that has multiple speakers (ideally including sound system above, but is not a requirement), especially spread out downstairs, that I can play music together.  I have tried using some BT speakers, but they seem to be out of sync.  To be fair, it was 2 different brands, and different distances away.  What is my best bet here? Or is my only option really a bunch of echo devices to ensure synchronized sound?

I have tried home mini (still have it), but prefer the Alexa setup. Also, my GF has accepted Alexa now, so I don't want to push my luck with trying to switch to Google Assistant.  If there is a major compelling reason I might switch, but would need to be good.  


Edit: I have been mainly using wifi devices so far in my automation, but I think I will probably look at some local stuff, especially with ZigBee and Z-Wave stuff. so open to that as well.  
A lot of the stuff that would really have benefitted from the ZigBee/Z-wave stuff was stuff like light switches, motion sensors, etc, etc. which I couldn't change in the rental flat.  but also still open to wifi related services/devices.

If they are dimmable even better, but not totally necessary, I just want some cheap bulbs that I can easily OTA flash with tuya-convert or tuya-convert 2.0 and put Tasmota or ESP Home onto them for my local home automation set up.

Could anyone recommend me some? I'm hoping to find some for between $5 and $10 a bulb with some various wattages as well.

Recently, I noticed the basement light is often on.  The add-on switches can no longer control the smart switch.  However, my Habitat hub and the GE Z-Wave switch both control the light.

I originally noticed that the switch at the bottom (an add-on switch) was not working, and did not think to check the other add-on switch.  I ordered a new add-on switch and replaced the one at the bottom of the steps.  Same problem.

So, I'm kind of scratching my head now.  Is the other add-on switch not working (very rarely used) or is there a problem with the GE z-wave switch at the top of the steps?  I have had a rash of GE switches failing on me lately.  They usually get stuck in a strobe-light effect when they fail.

emuky6,1578679115,Under Furniture/Bed lighting ideas.,"Currently redoing a baby‚Äôs room. We would like to add some accent lighting in for late night visits. 

My idea was LED strip lighting under the crib, and on the opposite side of the room, under the dresser. 

I currently do not use any smart lighting at all at home. Don‚Äôt utilize Alexa, Google. Mostly an Apple house but no HomeKit in action. I do have Wyze devices though (which I love!)

So my current thought is to get some dumb LED strip lighting, plug into a Wyze plug (2 total, one on each side of the room) and use a Wyze Motion sensor, so if it senses someone walk through the door, it flicks on the accent lighting for 10 minutes. 

After looking into this I think RGB would be cool, were I could use a remote/app and set the color, and then whenever my Wyze Plugs provide power, they light up in the last used color. But not sure which strip lighting will turn on when power hits it, compared to having to hit ON on the remote after power is returned. 

I‚Äôm trying to find a way to add lighting at night, without using the overhead light. Open to ideas!

The main question. What controller should I buy. Homey, Animus heart or go for a Linux server (raspberry pi or an old media pc I already have)

Homey can do it all, but ugly and expensive. Also heard it has really poor range.

Animus heart have z-wave and 433, should be enough but immature sw, ok price.

With about three weeks to go until move in, I figured now is a good time to share an update. First off thanks for all the support! This community is awesome and has been a tremendous source of knowledge. We've been keen on future proofing as much as we can and not doing too many dumb things when we can't future proof. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a couple of progress pics. I'll add more or link to an album if there is interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Systems that we decided we've installed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lighting control**: Lutron Homeworks - based on all of the feedback we received we felt this was the best fit for us. The system will form the basis of our automate home and we wanted something that just worked. It also allowed us to minimize wall acne. We begin programming the system next week.

**Security:** Honeywell Lyric - lots of choice in the area. Given that we were essentially a new construction home we opted to hard wire as much of the system that we could. We are going to give HomeKit a shot and Lyric appears to work well with HomeKit

**Exterior cameras:** Netatmo outdoor security cameras - It was important to us that video data be stored locally. These cameras simply work great and the alerting has been rock solid. We will add the Netatmo video door bell when it becomes available.

**Smoke/CO2**: Nest protect - All of the feedback we've received indicated that Nest protect is a great product that works well.

**Audio/Video distribution:** AirPlay2 and AppleTV - our goal is to keep things simple. We've installed in-ceiling speakers throughout the home with ""homerunned"" speaker wires to our equipment room. We've also run Cat 6 to each of the TV locations. My plan is to use AirPlay2 equipped Airport Express base stations as pre-amp inputs to a multi-zone/whole home amp. Would love thoughts/feedback on this approach. 

**Garage Door Opener:** MyQ chamberlain smart opener. So far so good with this choice. It is passing the ""just work"" test.

**Locks**: August smart locks.

I want to replace this with something smart to better control my energy usage, particularly Google Assistant compatible since I've got Homes in almost every room.

The problem is that this is the house that jack built and just running wires seems to be an issue.

Living in this house for affordable rent is the sacrifice you make for your kids to go to good schools. LOL

You cannot open the garage door with your voice.

I was able to find a relatively inexpensive solution.  I bought one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752P57ZG/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_-wHgEb1JB977M) little 5V WiFi relays and wired it in parallel with the wall switch. It looks like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/JOlwhjY.jpg). BUT, it's not quite as easy as it looks. You can't just put the relay across the 2 screw terminals that are used to connect the wall switch. You have to take the wall switch apart and put TINY pieces of wire on to the little switch on the circuit board. In my case, I just sort of forced strands of  24AWG Cat5 wire under the switch on each side. Use a multimeter to check continuity to find the proper terminals.

Once those connections are made, connect the two wires to the common and normally open terminals on the relay.

From there, follow the relay's manufacturer instructions to connect it to your WiFi and program it for momentary closure not continuous.

Lastly, I downloaded the relay's App and linked that to IFTTT along with Google Assistant. Programmed it to active the relay when I say ""open the garage.""

I have a detached garage so it's nice to be able to tell my google home to open the door as I'm walking out of the house intsead of digging out my phone or using the keypad at the garage.  Other than that, it's not really all that useful, but for around 13USD it's worth it.

eng3gs,1578789253,Anyone use Flair smart vents?,"We have what I think is a pretty common problem - central air but no ‚Äòzone control‚Äô to keep the temperature even. 

We have an ecobee 4 with 3 remote sensors so the thermostat plus the sensors cover 4 locations in the home and I‚Äôve set it to optimize the temperature for different areas at different times of day.

enhspa,1578797587,My vision for the type of home automation I'm looking for...," I've lurked around Reddit for quite sometime, but I have finally decided to quit being a pus and post as there seems to be an incredible number of smart and talented people here that I am interested in learning something from.

Home automation is one such area.

With that in mind, I would like to lay out my vision of the type of home automation I would like to have and see if it is even possible or if I am an idiot who will quickly get laughed at. Either way, I learn something! Yes, I have been poking around and looking at the different offerings, but damn, there are a lot.

I really don't want anything to do with the Amazon or Google eco-sphere, so yeah...there's that. I'm also not a fan of wireless due to interference and hacking issues... 

Now with that being said, let's move on!

I'm going to break this down into sections to try and keep this organized as possible and hopefully keeps me from sounding like a moron.

**Doorbell**

When someone walks up to my front door, I would like for there to be a touch panel next to it. All one has to do is simply touch the screen which will activate the notification system. A custom graphic / message telling that person to ""stand by"" will be displayed alone with some kind of audio feedback that something is happening. It will be at this point that no matter where I am in the house I can answer the door.

If on my PC:

A window will pop up allowing me to see them and hear them, but only allow them to hear me unless I choose to allow them to see me as well. It will be at this point the message on the outside touch screen will change to ""Connected"" or some other nerdy shit. I also want the ability to release the mag-locks and physical locks on the door and allow them entry.

If in any other room in the house, or not near my PC in my office:

There will be a control panel in each room (more on these later) where I want the exact same functionality.

On any control panel, or the main system (PC, more on this later) I want to be able to see the status of the mag-locks and smart locks as well as whether the door is open or closed / secured.

**Windows**

There isn't much you can really do with these, though I have seen actuators that can open and close the windows. Problem is I don't know how feasible these are though it would be freaking awesome if these could be integrated into the system for full automatic and one touch climate control (more on that later.)

Window shades / curtains, same thing, full control as well as being able to see the status of all of these from any control panel / master panel.

**Lighting**

Integrated lighting (in ceiling, in wall, baseboard, perimeter ceiling recessed lighting strips, etc.)

I want full room or whole house accessibility with the ability to develop custom profiles, colors, brightness levels etc. LED is going to be a prominent lighting source (though not 100%) and I want recessed hidden LED strips in the baseboards (extreme low level light, basically night lights) and recessed hidden LED strips where the walls meet the ceiling for ambient light. These LED's must be high quality, no flickering when dimmed, RGB but good cool or warm white mode as well. All of this I want to be able to control for any control panel or the main panel with the ability to see status, color, brightness settings, etc.

As far as my office goes, same thing, however with a different twist. I have seen the light ""panels"" and I want to tile my ceiling in those making for 100% ceiling coverage in these with the same properties i.e. no flicker dim, RGB, good cool and warm white, fully addressable, etc. I do not have really good vision and having total coverage in the way I'm describing will help me tremendously with shadows when writing (since the light will be coming from everywhere) or other tasks such as soldering, etc., and I'll never be wanting for light as at full intensity..well, it will be BRIGHT.

Non-integrated lighting such as lamps I would like as much control as possible but I know I may be limited on this, which is fine though if someone has a suggestion that would be neat.

**Water**

I want full control over the water system of the house. Leak monitoring and the ability (thought some kind of actuator or electronic control valve) to shut off main water should something happen. I want to be able to see the status of the water system (pressure, temp, etc.)

**Electricity**

I want to be able to see and manipulate as many aspects of the mains as possible. I want some kind of smart panel that tells me all about the power coming into my house, voltage, quality (dirty, over or under, etc.) the ability to kick over to auxiliary power (1st level, local battery back ups on important stuff, 2nd level the gen-set, level 1 will be able to hold the load long enough for the gen-set to kick in.) I want to be able to see total load that is being drawn at any given time in real time with logging capabilities. It would be nice if there was a way to have fine granularity (down the each individual wall socket) as well, but I know that might be asking for too much, again, if I'm wrong, let me know.

**HVAC**

I want full control over the climate systems on each room panel and master panel. I want to be able to see the status of this system, see temps in each room, humidity in each room. I would also very much enjoy having external monitoring capabilities as well, temp, humidity, wind speed, pressure, etc. I'm also a big fan of attic fans during certain times of the year, and being able to open all the windows to a certain percentage as well as kicking on the big ass blower that will be in the attic would be awesome.

The big one...**SECURITY**

My house will be situated on a piece of land that I own, location doesn't matter. I want three layers.

Layer 1: Fence line proximity detection.

Layer 2: External cameras and lighting.

Layer 3: Internal cameras (only used when everyone is away), window and roof intrusion detection (motion, physical (sensors, etc.)

ALL of this I want to be able to control from the security panel. I will go into the network scheme that I would like to use later, but for now I will say that when I pull up the security stuff, I want to be able to see EVERYTHING outside (and inside if manually triggered to do so, and no there won't be cameras in the obviously stupid places like the bathroom, etc.) If an ""event"" occurs in layers 1 or 2, then a custom audio / video notification will be sent or displayed, if attempted (or oh shit successful) forced entry occurs (whether we are there or not) same thing, but to a higher degree which if layer 3 is triggered then everything will be recorded, you know...that way the authorities can not only identify the bodies, but see what the hell happened too. Excessive, maybe, but I've been a victim, enough said.

**NETWORK**

My father, who will be helping me with this part, used to be a lead network administrator for a federal agency, the specific one doesn't matter. My network architecture will consist of the following:

Intranet: This is where all the home automation and security stuff will be happening. One bad ass ThreadRipper PC should be able to handle the automation and security if set up properly. I want everything Ethernet if possible with each room having its own switch that will service all automation network devices in that room. Each rooms network switch will then be connected to the main router where the main panel is located, so only one CAT6 cable per room though there will be many shorter CAT runs within each room.

Internet access: The property has FTTH rocking a truly unlimited (no caps!) 1GBit up / 1 GBit down connection. The intranet will be accessible from the internet BUT only using a hardware based encryption system (the same kind of system my dad had to use to connect to his works VPN from home). It requires two pieces of hardware. The ""key"" on the server side, and the ""key"" on the client side. His key consisted of a little USB doodad and if that doodad was not installed that VPN wouldn't even bother to acknowledge your existence. Once connected you still had to provide credentials, and I actually like the idea of the token system where you have the little fob that when you push the button you get a RAND # that never appears again and then login name and PW. Once though that, the connection is still hardware encrypted so yeah, good luck snooping on that shit. This will allow me to see all house stuff and video feeds (doorbell, etc.) and be able interact with them with confidence that no one else can do shit about it, or mess with it.

So there it is, my basic idea of what I want my home automation to be. Criticism is welcome, though please keep it civil, I am no expert and I really want to learn. Any ideas or suggestions would also be quite welcome!

Wanted to go for something like ground-source heat pumps, but we've ended up deciding that System boiler + Unvented Tank works for us (2 bathrooms, busy house). Not looking to retrofit the house with UFH, so looking at using convectors/radiators. 

There seems to be a number of improving vendors on the market today, but the review sites are no better than reading the marketing info.

Q1. Love the idea of controlling heating on a room/radiator basis using [Smart Radiator Valves](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0747XH349?pf_rd_p=f20e70b1-67f9-48d1-8c78-ba616030b420&amp;pf_rd_r=MED65GEMWVFPVFBYCXQE). Do they work well in practice over zone/thermostats? and have any of you found them worth the additional investment?

Q2: When it comes to our home I'm a fan of durability:

1. Any products out there that look like they'd actually still work in 10 years?
2. Which products still work with an internet outage? e.g. Hive's introduced Hub 360.
3. Which brands are here to stay, and I won't need to redo the entire system in less than 10 years?

The original ‚Äòpro‚Äô version is $700 and requires a plumber to install (which I imagine would add $400 to the price tag).

I had a crazy idea and just want some verification that I'm not going to burn my house down doing this.

I use LIFX smart bulbs and I always struggle with having to re-register them when people flip the light switch. To bypass this, I'm thinking about replacing the the light switch with an electrical outlet. In order to make sure the light is always on, I would use a wire nut to connect the two black wires, as well as a new black wire that would provide power to the outlet.

This idea seems clean and elegant - and I could even plug a mounted tablet into the outlet for more advanced control without actually interrupting power to the smart bulb. But will it work? Is it safe to do this?

I recently conceded to myself that when I move to my own flat in a few months I will be using a Phillips hue hub to use a motion sensor for the hallway, I have currently 3 motion Xiaomi UK hub setup for my parents but the timeout for the motion sensors makes it a tad annoying for me  (when Xiaomi sensor sees motion it won't detect again for 2 minutes) 

This means the only good way of using it is having it set as if no motion within 5 minutes turns off, this is a bit long for my liking.

I bought the hue hub for ¬£13 early as it was a good deal and wanted to buy the stuff to test out beforehand (geek in me).

I needed a cool white bulb so it made sense to pay extra 9¬£ to get the dimmer pack for ¬£29, and I am amazed at how good the product is, A bulb and the moveable remote, using Bluetooth so no hub needed, response is really quick, and you can buy a cover plate to go over existing switch for ¬£5.

I know a physical Wall switch plate is better but I first have no idea which one I need, In the UK there is no netural cable or something like that, and secondly place I am moving too might only bee a 3 year place to live so changing these around might be costly, wheras the hue switch is so easy to take off unaffected.

The hue setup 29¬£

and from what I've seen the physical one are like ¬£20

So not much more for the Hue more flexible, yes the wall one will proberly be more reliable but it also can't be take off the wall and be a remote so it has that as a disadvantage.

I am looking to set up some automated photography throughout the day.  
My idea is to track the sun throughout the sky from morning til evening - so I need something that rotates both horizontally and vertically. Something like a gimbal, but I'm not too bothered about stabilization as this contraption will be mounted on a static platform.

With an android phone connected to my mac I can script and schedule automatically taking photos using the android sdk tools.

My problem is that I am unable to find a programmable rotatable tripod or mount. I have found some on amazon that respond to a remote control, but this isn't a programmable solution.

This is a hobby project so I'm not looking to break the bank, but is there anything out there that I could connect via USB and send some rotation commands? Ideally I'd like to send commands to rotate by certain degrees on both x and y axis independently.

...Someone who has either done more research than me or someone who has learned the tough lessons and/or blew their budget trying to figure out what works best for them. 

I have been interested in home automation since Smart Things was a kickstarter. 

Now that I am in a position to do home automation right from the beginning I need some help.

-SONOS Playbar, Sub, One and One SL 

-Amazon Flex (x10)

-Amazon Echo Dot (x3)

-Sensors

-Plugs

-Lightbulbs

-Light Strips 

-Cameras (Indoor/Outdoor)

-Washer/Dryer

-GPS Tracking 

-Applications (I would like the least amount of apps possible) 

-Remote Controls

-Blinds

-Garage Door Opener

I basically need to keep the functionality of physical buttons because of the wife who doesn't play nice with Alexa (or Alexa doesn't play nice with her).

1.

Does anyone here have a RPM Pro+ and can you confirm?
2. A) [Sonoff](https://www.amazon.com/SONOFF-Bridge-Switch-Automation-Universal/dp/B079DPZGJ3/ref=sr_1_24?keywords=sonoff&amp;qid=1578952214&amp;sr=8-24): Some reviews say that it doesn't work with their 433mhz RF devices, but I'm suspicious that they don't know the difference between rolling codes and not. I'm thinking my Etekcity RF outlets are NOT rolling codes (since it worked fine with the Hook and Hook specifically said they did not work with rolling codes).  Also, says it can only do 4 devices (I have 5 now) which is a downgrade, but I can live with that. Can anyone confirm that Etekcity outlets works with Sonoff and Alexa?

* B) Sonoff flashed with Tasmota: This looks like it could be an option, but I'm not sure if I have the time to figure out how to flash hardware. Don't I also need a separate computer to handle the ""HomeAssistant"" server? Seems complicated. Does anyone offer to do this as a prepackaged deal? Maybe I could buy an already-flashed-Sonoff from ebay?

1. Can anyone recommend another option?

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-emptive answers to questions:

Why not use integrated wall switches? Current wall switches are located in inconvenient places. Also, the living room uses floor lamps, and the wall switches do not control the outlets. So I would need to use either smart outlets or smart bulbs. And I don't like the idea of smart bulbs for other reasons.

Why not just use a [Smartthings Button](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-GP-U999SJVLEAA-One-Touch-Appliances/dp/B07F8ZFFQK) and zigbee/zwave/wifi outlets? Ex: single click toggles living room lamp #1, double click toggles living room lamp #2, press &amp; hold toggles the pair. I asked the wife about this, and she said NO.

If it helps, my smarthome also has a Smartthings hub, and I am familiar with webcore and IFTTT.

Thanks!

If not using myQ, can any myQ signal be deactivated?  Or...is it more like the myQ hub acts like another remote control, and when you open the garage via the app, the hub basically acts as if you're opening the garage with a remote and sends the same signal to the opener from inside the garage?  Is that how it communicates with the opener? How about for the openers that have myQ with WiFi?  Can the Wifi signal be turned off if not being used?



Are there any units that come without the myQ and WiFi technology?  Or do all new decent units include that?

eofsqp,1578973743,How to Customize Motion Sensor Lights,"I have a ring security system and a Caseta smart switch.


I got the bright idea to make the Caseta lights motion sensor based on the ring motion detector.  This worked with an Alexa routine,  but it was very basic.  Anytime movement was detected, the lights came on at 50%.   This was neat at first, but we quickly realized that if we had the lights turned down to 20% for watching TV and got up, we‚Äôd get blasted with 50% light and have to manually turn it back down where we wanted it.


I‚Äôd like to make it so that the lights only turn on if motion is detected and the lights are off.  I know I could set Alexa to wait a certain amount of time before doing running the routine again, but I think that could be a cumbersome approach and could tale a while to dial in.


Any suggestions for ways to implement this automation?  Is this where a dedicated smart hub or HA come into play?

Currently I have the following devices in my home:

1 Echo spot
1 Echo dot
1 Google Home
15 Philips hue color lights (4 separate rooms, Front and back door)
1 Ring door bell
4 Wemo Cameras
6 Wemo smart plugs
2 wifi extension cords (office monitors and fish tank)
1 wifi heater
2 wifi strip lights

I am looking to start to start adding some switches/sensors that I can begin to trigger Alexa routines and activate Philips hue lights as soon as I walk in the room. 

I looked online and there are PIR motion sensors but a lot of them say they are for alarm based systems. I am not sure if they can handle/support the automation that I am attempted.

Could anybody please offer any suggestions?
any advice is much appreciated.

Not knowing what company it is or whatever we figured, why not but that was before I knew about the company. 

I had a chance to check out what system it is, and its the Vivint with the sky panel. I did see two security cameras left in the house, some sensors for glass breakage, and a thermostat. 

1. I'm yet to call and ask but from reading around the forums, it seems like it will be close to impossible for me to do anything without having to take over the contract. It doesn't seem like I'll be able to change the pin or even use the app. 
2. I have an ecobee thermostat which I prefer to use, so will be removing theirs regardless. 
3. I also have my own POE camera system, so the cameras left behind will not be used.

Preferably hard buttons.,"I just went through the painful experience of converting my entire home to sonoff smart light switches which all failed within 4 months. I appreciate all the advice I got in a previous post about troubleshooting and flashing the switches. After careful consideration and trying some of the steps I've concluded that these devices all needs to be replaced. A light switch isn't something that you should be concerned about that it will work or won't, and that it should not be harder to switch on or off manually than a regular switch.

Which brands of smart switches (may necessitate neutral wire) would you guys recommend? Non US shape / rectangular shape required. Physical switch preferred over a touch sensitive switch. Price really is important, as I can't spend another small fortune on this. I already have to pay an electrician because there are so many switches to replace.

I'm in South Africa, so it might also be hard to obtain some of the brands.

I have a few questions.

I have a routine set so my bedroom light comes on and my tv (fire stick) turns on at 4:30am.
What I actually want to happen is at my 4:30am alarm, my light turns on, my tv turns on and then my tv will open sling TV and start a news channel and low volume. So far my lights come on and that's it, I think I figured out how to get the tv on using the CEC option, I guess I'll know for sure tomorrow morning. So to make it simple it would go like this

Routine - Workout alarm

4:30am alarm -&gt; light on -&gt; tv on -&gt; sling TV -&gt; news channel

My next question is regarding my pixel XL. So this is the original pixel XL 128gb version, running Android 10. I was trying to think of what to use it for since I have the Note 10+. I saw a few articles about using it as a server or something. I'd honestly like to use it as some sort of hub for my home automation goals. Here are some thoughts:

Monitor my wifi so when I get home and my phone connects to my wifi, my lights will come on, tv turns on/ music/ news, 

The server idea I read was cool, like if I had a get together I can have my friends upload photos from the night to a folder on the server but IDK what else to use a server for.

It's really annoying because my TV is connected to it.

1.  isn't it supposed to stay ""on"" even if there's no internet connection? I mean I can turn it on and off using its physical power button as you can see in the picture below.
2. is every smart power plug like this? Any variation or interruption in the wifi signal and it will turn off?
3. like most smart power plugs out there this one is also cloud-tethered. So maybe that might be the cause it's powering down by itself on any wifi signal interruption? (I use the Tuya app/Smart Life app/skill)
4. If this is a faulty one or it's particular to that brand, which other brands could I use that will stay on even if my wifi connection gets turned off? I mean working as an ordinary power plug adapter when I have no internet connection.

P.S. The issue here is it turning off by itself due to some wifi interruptions and not about its loss of funtions through voice or phone app.

ep51xa,1579108289,A few simple questions about automating a light switch from a newbie.,"Hi guys, I am very knew to this home automation thing. 
Recently we purchased a home. My area is the basement. 

Unfortunately, when we were doing renovations, we didn't do it ideally so the main basement light switch is at the top of the flight of stairs. So every time I want to turn on or off the light, I have to climb the stairs, hit the switch, and then climb back down. 

This is really inconvenient so I bought [this four pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PJTLB7Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) of smart light switches for $80. However, when I opened my light switch, I saw it only had two wires coming out of it and no neutral wire. So I could not implement it.

Then later I saw someone link [this light switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HM6L48C?pf_rd_p=ab873d20-a0ca-439b-ac45-cd78f07a84d8&amp;pf_rd_r=5R9NK2GFVP56Q16XFD9R) which seems to not require a neutral wire. 

However, it is more expensive than the previous being close to $70 for one when the other was $80 for four. Will this better light switch work with my situation? Why does the cheaper one require a neutral wire and this one doesn't? Are there any differences between the two light switches or are they both just smart light switches that I can control through my phone over internet? Is there a better light switch that you guys can recommend me?

I technically have four light switches in my basement. What would be the best and cheapest way to automate all four? But the most important one is the one above the stairs since it is a huge hassle while the others are placed in normal locations.",natantantan,/r/homeautomation/comments/ep51xa/a_few_simple_questions_about_automating_a_light/,1,homeautomation,5

All I can find out is that they're manufactured by Vista Products (the ""Simplicity Line"").  Looking at Vista Products, they mention that the Simplicity line uses the ""Neo Smart Blinds"" app, so maybe the motor/electronics are actually manufactured by Neo?

I'm probably going to take my chances on this and hope it works, but since the blinds/shades may not be returnable, I'd love to know if anyone has any experience with Allen+Roth, Vista Products, or Neo Smart Blinds in terms of integration with a Zwave/Zigbee automation hub or Google Assistant (or something else that would serve as a bridge to either of those).

epaebw,1579130627,"If this AND that, Then something..","Hi everybody,

I wish to apologise for my poor english in the first place, I will try my best.

I started my journey in home automation very, very recently. For start I bought an echo plus (2nd gen) and 2 echoes (3 gen).Just as start. I also bought 1 Samsung wifi Smart thing motion sensor (PIR) , 2 door sensor like proximity sensor, and 6 wifi-smart life- light bulbs. Before I start my complains, I will throw this: Im just a common  senior Full stack Engineer.  I started realizing the routines in Alexa are really really basic, like really really basic.A Device (an event) triggher, you can turn on a light(or write something to google calendar or do something, wait and do something). Coming from ""oh boy IMMA automate my home"". This is pretty limiting and sad. I start watching a lot of Youtube videos and realizing, the things you can do with common system, are way too basic and simple. So I start asking what if, based on a sensor, I want to turn the light red on the night and white during day ? Well, the only answer I found myself is to use 2 different applets on ifttt with javascript filters. Filters basically let you to skip the action based on some code , like if(time).. So I started asking myself, is this pretty much it ? Dont get me wrong, I like the idea of saying ""Alexa, goodmorning"" and she says hi Alessio, time blabla, weather blabla, meeting for today are blabla, and turn on the stairs lights... But this is like , really really limiting.   
So, you are the experts and Im sure I missing like more then 3/4 of the world for some reason. How can I automate in a more proper way ? What if I want something like: A motion sensor triggher, if its thusday and it's night turn the light green, if its monday and its day turn the light yellow, otherwise turn the light white ? This is , of course, a stupid example. What if I want to turn on a virtual switch like ""home armed"" and from this point I want my home act in a different way then when ""home armed is disabled"" ? And based on time, devices status and so on? I cant believe that this is a pipe dream and automation is pretty much that boring and simple and stupid. I wouldn't mind if anyone can point me to a system fucking compiled in assembler x86 where you can actually write something useful. (this is an exaggerating sentence).

epd0ql,1579142852,"VLANs, subnets, both, or something else? Drawbacks to it all? Lots of questions","So, upon doing some planning for home automation stuff, as well as a couple servers open to the internet and some things (like security cameras) that I don't want open to the internet, I'm wondering how I should approach my network. I'm thinking about redoing it all into VLANs or subnets, but I've never messed with either much before.

Ideally, I'd like to have a few separate VLANs:
Home, for PCs, Laptops, trusted phones, tablets, etc. Everything here will be firewalled but have plenty of outbound internet access...
IoT/HA, for home automation devices and hubs, possibly cameras, etc. Only one ""device"" (VM) here should have access to the internet (Home Assistant server), and only on specific ports to allow the Home Assistant app access remotely...
Hostile (or something more aptly named), for web server(s) and such. Open to the internet in all its disgusting ""glory"" because, well, servers?
Streaming/Gaming, for, well, devices that are primarily only used to stream or video game consoles that need somewhat open outbound internet access but not-totally-open inbound access (port forwarding and such?)
Guest, for anyone who comes to visit and wants internet access. Similar to Home but segregated so they can't access my ~~porn stash~~ shared drives or media, possibly forced VPN(?)

Does this sound reasonable? Or would/should some of these be combined because they're the same thing? Other than stuff like casting things to my TV or quick setup of HA devices and such, what drawbacks might I face from doing this sort of segregation? Should I both VLAN *and* Subnet? If so can I do each VLAN on its own class c subnet (10.10.1.0, 10.10.2.0, etc) or...? If I do segregate things in this manner, can I do something like: set up a scene to automatically turn my TV on when I occupy the front room (and lights/temperature/whatever else the scene does), using some kind of IR/HDMI-CEC device on the IoT VLAN, yet still have that smart TV on the Streaming/Gaming VLAN?

I know a lot of this is likely better suited for r/HomeNetworking or another networking heavy sub, but the main reason for doing this is home automation related. I'd like heavy input on the impact of home automation devices and such. In the end, I want my home automation and smart devices to be rock-solid and simply always be able to work, even if the other networks are compromised or non-functional for some reason... I can live without Netflix or using my computers and such for a while, but lights, locks, heating/cooling, and security I don't want to ever go down if possible.

For reference, I currently only have a smart thermostat, Google home mini, and some other small ""smart"" things, but I plan to get a LOT of smart devices and automate my home this year. Also, network-wise, I have a Ubiquiti AP, a Netgear GS748T, and a custom-built pfsense router. (Currently looking at an Inovelli dimmer pack and a Z-Wave dongle...

In the past I tried home assistant which, while covering a lot of devices, was extremely slow to respond to state changes in my experience.

To avoid setting up Webthings for the third time only to watch it eventually fail, I was hoping someone could recommend an alternate system for me. I currently have my eye on hubitat which seems to check all the boxes for me.

The main things I want are:

1) local and fast control of TP-link kasa switches

2) hue lights

3) homekit/nest/ring control (i have a raspberry pi zero W set up with homebridge so in a pinch, all I need is homekit compatibility)

I haven't received the switches/bulbs yet, but I got the Z-Stick. And my troubles have already begun.

Previously, I installed HAss.io on a Hyper-V VM because it was already available, Hyper-V is free to use on Win10 Pro, and I knew I wanted to go the VM route - I plann(ed?) to build a virtualization server eventually, and thought this might be a good start.

Well, I found out Hyper-V doesn't support attaching (non-storage) USB to VMs. Okay. So looking around and it seems VMWare/ESXi does, and there's a free server hypervisor. Cool. Downloaded, and went to install the server software on a spare laptop (that has hardware virtualization, mind you) for now... Only to find out my laptop's NIC is unsupported, and there are no community/third party options for drivers. üò†

So now what? I could reinstall Windows on the laptop and use VMWare Workstation, though I have no idea if that can run as a service like Hyper-V, nor if it can auto-attach the Z-Stick to a given VM. I could (attempt to) use my old (v1? Model B) Raspberry Pi with ser2net/socat or remserial to build a ""hub"" myself, but that's annoying as hell and I'd almost rather just return the Z-Stick and get a hub. I could try to hurry along the purchase of ESXi supported hardware, but I don't want to rush that sort of purchase.

I refuse to buy another RasPi just for this, because I want the power of a PC (minimum) behind Home Assistant, and I'm not going to get a NUC when I want to use the server/PC to host a handful of other VMs as well.

What other options are there for my situation? Did I make a bad choice investing in Z-Wave right now given everything else I'm dealing with? I'm honestly frustrated enough about this that I'm tempted to return it all already. Give me some hope here Reddit!

I have been using Xiaomi smart home things for a while. Everything works fine (from UK on Chinese server), but I really want to use Alexa to control my lights (through switches). 

After some time reading and trying and failing to make it work I discovered that you can use Xiaomi ZigBee devices with SmartThings hub. I've bought one, but while trying to connect all my devices I found out that only one button can be controlled for two-button switches. That is really frustrating. That's exactly what I want (and its magic!) but unfortunately, Alexa can control only one button.

Is there any way to make it all work? All wall switch DTHs I found don't work with both buttons. Has anyone managed to do that? Can it be done using Home Assistant? Haven't tried it so know nothing about it. I hear there was EU version of aqara hub. Would Alexa discover switches if they are connected to EU server? I can connect motion sensors and Alexa now.

Forgot to mention, I switched to Android and Windows devices two years ago and not willing to get Apple stuff to be able to use HomeKit.

I can replace door/motion/leak sensors etc if needed, but I have about 15 wall switches (two and single button) and replacing them would be complicated (time- and moneywise).

UPDATE1: I have tried to switch server to UK, US, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and neither of them worked. The app just couldn't discover the hub. The only server that works is China mainland. Does it mean I have some China version of the hub? Would getting another version of the hub help?

3. I can adjust the brightness of a bulb with my phone (preferably via Google Assistant), not needed on the wall.
4. There is no need for any hub (I am not going to expand my system any further so I would prefer to save the money)

I tried to do some research on my own, and arrived at a few conclusions:

1. I can't only get a smart bulb, cause when the wall switch is off, it wont turn on
2. I can't only get a smart wall switch because they wont allow for brightness adjustment
3. I should probably get a smart wired (?) wall switch + a smart light bulb?

I haven't started down the path of home automation/security yet.  I have played with ZoneMinder and Home Assistant in the past.

In terms of stuff I already have have Alexa, LiFX, 3 x Amcrest IP3M-956E (not deployed) and a 24/7 Linux server.

For any new stuff I buy I like the idea of it not relying on any (proprietary) cloud services, be great if all software could all be deployed locally on my Linux server.

It would be great if any sensors used MQTT.

I'm thinking external cameras, door sensors, motion sensors, it should look neat, bare microcontrollers with dupont wires connecting sensors lying around will not have the requisite WAF (the sensors should probably be battery powered).

Maybe because I have Alexa deployed already I could use ""Guard"" to detect glass breaking.

I‚Äôm the garage we have a light switch dedicated to the plug on the ceiling that is for the garage door opener. This is so I could turn the garage door off at night making anyone who would be getting into my truck unable to use the garage door opener. 

It drives me crazy though because people will always accidentally turn it off when I don‚Äôt want them to. We come home all the time to open the garage when it‚Äôs ‚Äúsomeone threw the switch... who‚Äôs going in to turn it on‚Äù 

Sounds like a perfect solution for a zwave on off switch. Put it into a routine where whenever I arrive home that switch gets activated.

Say for example, I wanted to power off and on a remote power outlet in such a building. How would I best integrate this. I don't want to go HomeKit-style and just buy any plug and connect it to WiFi. This is something that should work for a business even after I'm gone. It should have interfaces and connectors to other applications and support automation.

Side Questions: what is a business equivalent to a regular  smart switch? Are there any specific vendors?",pay85,/r/smarthome/comments/er9ik7/something_universal_like_home_assisant_but_for_a/,3,smarthome,3
er9o01,1579503547,Controlling 433Mhz RF ceiling fan with HASS,"Hi,

I want to turn my ceiling fans on with HASS, they are 433Mhz RF, nearly identical to this:

[Similar remote](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Casablanca-Ceiling-Fan-DC-6-Speed-Replacement-Remote-Control-Transmitter-RH787T-/202325848978)

It would be great if this ""bridge"" was open and used MQTT or ESPHome.

It should look neat, bare microcontrollers with dupont wires connecting receivers lying around will not have the requisite WAF.  It probably needs to have a way to ""sniff"" and definitely needs a way to ""set"" the code like you would with the DIP switches on the remote.

Anyone been in the same situation with similar requirements but done something about it, what did you go with and would you do it differently now?

Thanks.

Does Google not allow one to input an audio stream into their API to control Google home via voice? And the reason why this switch exists for Alexa is because Amazon does allow it?

So basically, before I automate my home, should I switch out my Google home with Alexa? This switch is really nice: I won't have to have those ugly Google mini pucks all over the place.

I have been researching moving into home automation but I am getting a little overwhelmed with the options. 

Goals: 
Self monitored security that arms/disarms automatically using geofence or similar 

Door lock that does the same

Automated lighting

Smart thermostat

Cameras 

On hand:
Old ADT Safewatch Pro 3000 (Honeywell Vista 20p) with a non-programming keypad (6150 I think)

Wired front door sensor

Wired back door sensor

Wired kitchen motion

Wired smoke in living room

Two sirens

This system has not had power since we purchased the house in 2016. It only has those 4 zones. 

If you were starting over with this would you keep it and add EnvisaLink or Konnected and a programmable keypad with RF? Ditch it and use a smart ecosystem for automation and alarm?

My heating/cooling set up is this.

I have a 3 zone (3 thermostats) oil baseboard register heating system. I also just installed a heat pump system (two wall units on the main level, and 3 ceiling vents upstairs in bedrooms)

The system is a Daikin and the wall units I believe are CTXG12QVJUW, I'm not sure the model upstairs but it has a receiving unit for the remote in the hallway. I know the wall units have a board that can be added to them to allow wifi access.

Eventually what I would like is to have the system programmed to read the outdoor temp and if below X then the oil takes over to get temp Y and if above X let the heat pump handle it.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to use HomeAssistant to automate my home. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I need a thermostat for my basement, this zone has no heat pumps and the thermostat is broken, so I want to get something that would work well with the eventual setup and plan I have. 

I like the look of Nest but I would prefer something that doesn't rely on the cloud. I don't want anything in my home automation setup to go down if I lose internet connectivity. I prefer it to be all local.

What do you all suggest for me, what are your favorite thermostats, what ones are fully local if any, what has good homeassistant integrations? Has anyone set up a dual heating system like I'm attempting?

&gt; To our loyal customers,¬†  
   
&gt;  
&gt;We started a business from the ground up, with a team of enthusiasts who  wanted to give users an economical approach to home automation. Over  the course of several years, we built a team, a product, and a company  vision statement. We crowdfunded, sought investors, and eventually were  able to get a product to market. Competition in the market space and  increased cost of services has gradually reduced our ability to provide  proper customer support. For this, we humbly apologize. Our hope was to  grow an online community to aid in setup and network support. We thank  all of our users that created helpful content and found creative uses  for the¬†Hook¬†platform.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;The cost of servers and support has increased while sales have  diminished, and not having recurring revenue, we can no longer support  the costs of maintaining the servers that run the Hook app.¬†**We regret to inform our community that support for the Hook app will cease, effective 1/31/2020**.  While we do not wish for this to be the case, we cannot afford to  support servers on personal finances alone. After 1/31, the Hook app for  iOS/Android, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant commands, and any IFTTT  automation will no longer function.¬†  
   
&gt;  
&gt;There are a few options for continued use of Hook without the use of our  servers. Individuals are free to register their device with a Particle  account to take advantage of their device cloud. The access token for  your Particle (the chip that is the brains of the Hook) will be provided  to those who request it. In addition, we are in full support of an  offline or personal server option for Hook. We do not have the resources  to implement these solutions, but we will provide the necessary access  and support, including open-sourcing our code, for those willing help to  keep Hook¬†operational for all. If you are a developer interested in  lending your skills, or have access to resources to keep Hook going,  please reach out to us at¬†[connect@gethook.io](mailto:connect@gethook.io).  
   
&gt;  
&gt;We would like to thank everyone who has made¬†Hook¬†a successful product,  from our Kickstarter backers to our active forum members. The nature of  an IoT device in a competitive market held risk and we were happy to  take that risk to create the product we did. We learned to source  boards, injection molds, assembly support, packaging, and shipping  processes. We spent nights, weekends and more to provide timely  shipments. We filled garages with boxes, spent hours winding antennas,  fixing software, and placing pcb components on boards.¬†Overall, we loved  what we created. We love our users' passion (and yes, we saw the  criticism on our forums and did what we could to support issues as they  arose.) We provided the service we could with the budget we had. It was a  great experience to interact with you all and share our excitement.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;We will do everything in our power to ensure that we are not simply  turning our backs on our wonderful customers, but rather offering a  transition path that's a positive outcome for all. Again, please reach  out if you can offer any resources to this effort or wish to gain access  to your Particle token.¬†  
   
&gt;  
&gt;With heavy hearts and great appreciation, we wish to thank you all.

I've seen a few models with smart mapping that allows for setting boundaries but everything I've found are $500+. There are plenty of cheaper models but I've yet to find one under $300 that allows setting boundaries in their app. Putting down boundary tape is not an option unfortunately because my landlord doesn't want things stuck on the floors.

I'm building a house right now and will be at the point of electrical in the spring. I am torn between two options for smart lighting. Preliminary info:


- Will be using google assistant, require voice control

- entire house is 3500k LED bulbs, made by Satco. Two key types (95% of bulbs) are models S29837 and S9426. Their compatibility charts are way out of date but my understanding is that I need switches that are reverse phase compatible, so some sort of ELV compatible or dual phase switch. 

- Not interested in coloured lighting

- Need an app to configure schedules

- have about 4 locations requiring 3 ways. 


So my original plan was to use the Lutron Caseta line, specifically their ELV dimmer switch as it's the only one that will work with my bulbs. But here in Canada it is $120 each. And they aren't super stylish although passable. 

I've recently discovered the LeGrande brand and they have some unique stuff. Has anyone used their Radiant line? Specifically their tru-universal Wi-Fi enabled summer switch. It's $60 USD and seems to have all the required features.

es670i,1579663990,New to smart home devices. Had a question about Smartthings and Wemo.,"Hi everyone!

I have two Wemo mini outlets, and I was wondering if it was possible to add them in Smartthings. I tried to add a *Belkin Wemo* device from the Smartthings app and it told me I needed a hub. As of now I don't have one (waiting for the Galaxy Home), so I came up with a workaround. I added 2 virtual switches to Smartthings and linked Wemo and Smartthings to IFTTT. I created an IFTTT recipie that turns on a Wemo outlet when the respective virtual switch is turned on in Smartthings. It's been working *OK* so far. Sometimes there's a longer-than-usual delay (6-8 seconds), and sometimes there's a ***really*** long delay (~18 seconds). 

Also, that fact that the switches aren't synced can be a big problem sometimes. What I mean by this is, so lets say I connect my bedroom pole lamp to a Wemo mini and turn it on using Smartthings. It'll show up as ""On"" in both Smartthings and the GH App. If I turn it off manually (by pressing the physical button on it), the new state won't be reflected and it'll still show up as ""On"", even though it's off.

Is it possible to ""*natively*"" add (i.e. without an IFTTT recipie) a Wemo mini without a hub?

es7b7g,1579670016,How to turn a switched outlet into a half-hot outlet?,"Under my kitchen sink I have a fully switched socket which runs my garbage disposal. I would like to change it so only half of the socket is switched, and the other half is always hot...unfortunately I only have 2 wires running to the socket, so an old-school ""normal"" half-hot socket is not possible without running another wire, which will be more pain than it's worth.  Soooo I figure this should be pretty doable with some HA components...the problem is I can't find quite what (I think) I need/want.

First off, at the switch I'm planning on running the wires straight through, so the full outlet is always hot, then put some sort of wirelessly controlled plug on it which is somehow controlled by the switch.  It doesn't matter what the solution looks like under the sink, but above the sink it needs to fit in the standard electrical box, in an existing multi-gang box...ideally using the same style rocker switch, with the same responsiveness as the existing switch (requirements for wife approval). Oh, and the plug needs to be able to handle at least 7 amps. I don't need it to be connected to my hub or my phone or anything...in fact I'd rather it *not* be connected to anything if possible - a simple direct RF pair would be ideal.

Options I've looked at:
1. I have a bunch of lutron caseta already, and I like their responsiveness since they don't hit the internet...but as far as I can tell they don't have an appliance module which could handle 7 amps
2. There's lots of this sort of thing https://www.amazon.com/DEWENWILS-Wireless-Expandable-Switches-Receiver/dp/B07RGN9DY9/ref=mp_s_a_1_15?keywords=wireless+plug+remote+control&amp;qid=1579666904&amp;sprefix=wiresless+plug+&amp;sr=8-15 which would work, but the switch can not be mounted in a standard electrical box
3. There's this https://www.amazon.com/RunLessWire-Simple-Wireless-Self-Powered-Control/dp/B012H6QZVC/ref=mp_s_a_1_44?keywords=wireless+wall+switch+socket&amp;qid=1579667915&amp;sr=8-44 but it's surprisingly expensive, and can't handle 7 amps...and requires a neutral wire at the socket
4. I could just use a standard smart switch (with no load) and a smart plug, and set up an automation (via a hub of some kind) to coordinate them...but in my experience this will not give me the responsiveness I need
5. The sonoff mini (https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Universal-Automation-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B07TRSWY23/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?keywords=sonoff+mini&amp;qid=1579668769&amp;sprefix=sonoff&amp;sr=8-4) looks kind of awesome for the switch side, as it would let me keep using my existing rocker switch, but it's somewhat unclear on how exactly it would hook up to the socket component...some things I read indicated it had RF, or at least local-LAN-based communication which would be quite responsive, other things say it's all internet based...so it would likely have some lag. Also there's a lot of comments online about them not being UL certified and being very dangerous etc.

This seems like this could be a common enough problem that maybe someone else has figured out a nice elegant solution for this which I have not stumbled upon yet. Can anyone offer some insights, alternate approaches, or available products that I don't know about?

I've set up quite a few routines, and I'm happy to report that I mostly don't have to touch any buttons (except to show off). The problem is that I live with my mom who finds smart stuff fun, but always forget that it's there.

So, she tend to commit the worst sin : she uses the normal ""dumb"" light switch to turn the light on (not so bad), but then she uses it to turn it *off*, causing all my system to go down because that light is my main relay and the one that is in all routines.

So, I was wondering (and couldn't find much info on the internet): is there a smart light switch that would allow my mom to use it ""dumbly"" but would not cut all power to the light ? It would have to be EU compatible, and also compatible with my setup (I have Hue lights as I said, so Zigbee ? I also have a Pi with OpenHab and an Echo because voice is fun to me).

[Edit]: oh, also, I've seen a few that have a led on them. Even though I understand it's to find them easier, the switch would be in my bedroom, and I think that would get really annoying. So no led or the ability to turn it off would be great.

Can someone recommend a product that allow me to control these lights? Ideally I would love something similar to the Fibaro dimmers that I have that fit behind the current switch.

(Note: I live in Switzerland)

esgrso,1579721099,Help: Mini Split &amp; Boiler Automation," Hey Guys, looking to see if I could get a little help/pointed in the right direction.  
I've read numerous posts about automation to mini-splits and a boiler, but I haven't been able to find a clear answer on what the best solution is for connecting to multiple mini-splits.  
Basically, I have a few mini-splits (Fujitsu) in my home (cooling and heat pump; used primarily for AC only), and I have a gas boiler controlling my heat through baseboards.  
What products do you guys recommend to control my mini-splits and my boiler? I have one mini-split per floor, and one of the problems I get is that the temp isn't regulated the greatest. They're open areas and I believe it controls off the return air it sucks in from around the unit, rather than getting a reading say 10-15 foot away. Another thing I would like to do; when running heat through my baseboards, I would like it if I could set a temp sensor in a couple of areas so it would read the temperature more accurately.  
I also have a Samsung smart-hub. Ideally, I would like to be able to see/control the temperature of each mini-split/floor, and also see the temp/control the boiler.  
I've seen things on Ecobee, flair, and Sensibo, but I have no idea what is compatible and how/what to piece together.

eshnst,1579724926,DIY: Add smart control to your electric garage heater,"I recently bought an electric heater for my garage. I wanted to add smart control with a smart switch, but the average smart switch can't handle the current. Therefore, the solution is to use a smart switch to control a relay which in turn switches the heat load.

[Wiring Diagram for smart garage heater](https://i.imgur.com/DLcZci3.gifv)

I made it so that all the components are contained within the heater and it is all powered from one cord plugged into a 240V outlet.

I know this is a fairly simple project, but there are a few things to be aware of to make it work correctly:

\- use a double pole relay (or contactor)

\- use a Sonoff smart switch (or other DIY style switch e.g. Shelly)

\- make sure the relay has a 120V coil

Even though it was fairly simple, it's one of the most useful smart home projects I‚Äôve done. I can start the heater from the house and wait for the garage to warm up before I go out there. It saves me the initial trip out to the garage to start the heater.

Anyway, it seems like I constantly see people asking how to do this, so I hope you find it useful too:  [https://thesmartcave.com/how-to-make-smart-garage-heater/](https://thesmartcave.com/how-to-make-smart-garage-heater/)",TheSmartCave,/r/homeautomation/comments/eshnst/diy_add_smart_control_to_your_electric_garage/,1,homeautomation,4

esiv9b,1579729908,PSA to Harmony Hub users - Avoid unnecessary resets...there is a limit,"This is the first time I've encountered this issue, and wanted to share.

After resetting my Hub last night, I was shown a message in the desktop + mobile apps saying my Hub had been disabled and to contact Customer Service. I tried several additional resets, a new Harmony account app re-installs, etc. and the message wouldn't go away.

I emailed Logitech support around 11pm and much to my surprise, 'Ralph' sent me a very nice reply at 3am. Here are the relevant parts from Harmony support:

&gt;Our system will lock out a remote when it has detected excessive additions and deletions of devices to your remote account. Expected use would require only periodic additions/deletions of devices. This time I've enabled your remote account. So avoid deleting and adding the devices frequently.

&gt;Due to the product Terms of Use. Next time, your remote will no longer be able to make further updates to its configuration, when it gets disabled.

I'm still a little unclear on hub vs remote limits, seems to apply to the hub only, but not 100% on that. Mainly hoping this post helps some of you avoid similar issues!

I've always been in the habit of doing a factory reset over major reconfiguration. This last reset was due to a new router+ssid, and was a full reset.

That said, I do want to create some scenes and full automation for things in my house, and still be able to control those objects via voice. For example, if it's dusk, turn on the outside lights. If a motion sensor goes off, then turn on the kitchen under cabinet lights (will likely be Hue), or stairway lights. Additionally if my wife and I leave the home, using our phones as presence sensors, certain things would go into an ""away"" mode, and then resume when I return. Being able to unlock doors, let in guests, etc remotely is also really important as we have children.

Additionally the goal will be to standardize on Lutron Caseta switches (for the most part) for a lot of this home automation, namely because they have fan control and other smart switches do not (unless they do, then please let me know!). I will also use Hue lighting for my TV and undercabinet, in addition to a few other locations in the home (office). I will also be using [Konnected.io](https://Konnected.io) for automating my wired security system, since I hate the idea of paying a provider for these things.

* 2 Google Pixel 3 phones (for reference of Google Assistant...)
* Samsung Smart TV (main TV in living room)
* Sonos Beam Soundbar (in conjunction with the Sammy)
* 1 Chromecast Gen 2 (on Sammy tv)
* TCL Smart TV (basement setup)
* Office Philips Hue light bulbs and Dimmer control
* Living Room Philips hue bulbs and side table light and dimmer switch
* Master Bedroom Hue Light bulbs and dimmer control
* 2 WeMo smart plugs
* Nest Learning Thermostat latest gen
* Nest Secure, 2 sensors (1 on each of the front and back door), 2 key fobs
* Nest Protect CO/smoke detector, one for each main hallway/area of the basement, main level, and second floor of the house
* Google Nexus 5X phone that is laying around waiting to be used for????? Something like a wall mounted smart home remote? I have no idea, I'm open to any ideas here!

Basically, I'm hoping to get smarter (haha) about how we harmonize everything. I'd love for things to be as streamlined as possible for automating things with the Google Home app and Google Assistant routines. Any suggestions and advice are more than welcome. I wish I had lurked harder in this sub before we bought things, but some of it was carry over from a few years ago before we were married and had our own place. Even if it's just a suggested routine or something of that nature, that would be phenomenal. Everything to me just seems so disjointed, but that might be all in my head. We had an Amazon Echo gen 1, but I unplugged it as I was a little weary of our privacy and frankly, barely ever used the device for anything besides asking it to turn off and on the living room Hue lights. 

* Also, do you have any suggestions for what to use the WeMo plugs for? I had bought them on sale a while back last year, one specifically to use to plug our bedroom AC unit into so I could remotely turn the AC off and on to cool the room down before we go up to bed, but whenever I turned the power off while the AC was on it would turn it off obviously, but when trying to turn the power back on for the WeMo plug, the AC remained off.
* My final question, and I've started to do more research and lurking here, but what should my next step be if I want to, just say, try and automate as many lights as possible without getting any more devices that need a hub? Frankly, I'm unimpressed with the Hue bulbs as they require that hub and need the light switch to be on all the time to even function.",Astr0nautikal,/r/smarthome/comments/esm21c/how_can_i_better_get_all_my_stuff_to_work_together/,1,smarthome,2

I intend to use these in the bathroom. I would like for the sensor to report its humidity and temp data when it detects motion. From there automations turn on the light and will determine whether or not to turn on the heater and/or exhaust fan based on those values. I'm currently using smartthings as my hub and use both the new and classic app. I'm also experimenting with OpenHAB and HomeAssistant, interested in hubitat too but for now I'm sticking with smartthings. I would have thought it would automatically send all new sensor data when it detects motion but that doesn't appear to be the case. The only options I see in the settings are to change the update interval in seconds but that won't really work in this use case.   


Can this be done with this sensor, and if not can it be done with any off-the-shelf sensor. I'd like to avoid going the custom sensor route, but I will if that's the only option. 

Side note, is there a smart switch with a motion sensor that will integrate with smartthings and is UL listed? I know there are dumb switches, that's what I currently use but I'd like a smart version for more granular control and not need the extra sensor. Bonus points if it has extra sensors.

essfsk,1579782692,Mopidy + Snapcast multiroom audio - many questions!,"My current audio setup is this:

* All of my music is in a Samba share on my home server in an ""Artist/Album/Track"" folder structure.
* Most files have at least one tag that identifies them to one or more Foobar auto-playlists (e.g. ""BEST\_STEREO"", ""BEST\_SURROUND"", ""CAR"").
* I play them using Foobar on my Windows desktop or HTPC.

This works great but I want to replace this with a Linux/Pi based system because:

* My film/TV library is accessed via a Minix U9-H running LibreELEC (Kodi), so it'd be nice to have my music available in the same place.
* My HTPC doesn't get used for anything else any more so it would be nice to be able to retire it.
* My wife is interested in having music available in other rooms (e.g. office while we exercise or kitchen while cooking).

I have done some research into Mopidy + Snapcast and I have got the following test setup working:

* Mopidy installed on the server with the local library including a test folder with some music in it.
* Snapserver running on the server.
* Snapcast running on my phone as a client.
* MALP installed on my phone as a controller. I also have Iris/RompR working for desktop machines.

However, I have some questions that I'm hoping you all can help me answer to see if this is the right solution:

* **How do playlists work for local files?** Can I use dynamic playlists based on tags, like I use now? If not, can static playlists be added? I don't really plan on using Spotify or any other service for now so having local files and playlists easily accessible is key for me.
* **How does album art work?** Most of my album directories have album art included (usually as AlbumArt.jpg or folder.jpg) but these are not picked up at all by MALP, Iris, or RompR. I'm guessing I need to add another mopidy package to parse these files into a database or something?
* **How does surround audio work?** I have some 5.1 music and my main setup is 4.0 so I want to continue being able to play surround tracks via my AVR.  What happens if I add other clients that are stereo-only? How should I handle downmixing on a Raspberrry Pi client for example? From what I remember the snapcast config contains information on sample rate and channel layout but how does this actually work? Obviously I don't want to upmix all my stereo music to 5.1 when most of the Pis will have to downmix it back to stereo, potentially causing artefacts.
* **Is there any Kodi integration?** My research on this hasn't shown much beyond an experimental addon that doesn't work. Ideally there'd be a Kodi add-on that acted as both a Snapcast client and Mopidy controller but I'm guessing that doesn't exist. A Kodi add-on that is simply a Snapcast client would be acceptable since I can still control the music via my phone. At the moment I think I'd have to have a separate device (e.g. Pi) plugged straight into my AVR.
* **Is there any sleep/wake functionality for clients?** It seems like I'd have to keep a bunch of Pis on 24/7 for this to work, which given they'd have to be running DAC and amp hats sounds like a lot of wasted energy. It'd be nice to be able to sleep/wake them remotely - is this doable? I've never used a Raspberry Pi before so I have very little idea about what is possible with them.

As you can see there's quite a lot of things I need to think about and play with before I'm comfortable rolling something like this out, so any advice would be appreciated. My biggest worry is that it'll be super clunky, e.g. open an app to wake all Pis, open 2nd app to start playing music, open 3rd app to set volume/mute for each client, etc.",DragonQ0105,/r/homeautomation/comments/essfsk/mopidy_snapcast_multiroom_audio_many_questions/,1,homeautomation,2

et00jm,1579815892,IR aircon control with MQTT,"Hi,

I have a Daikin FTXM95PVMA, it has wifi (BRP072A42 module) but on that model airspeed can't be controlled over wifi which makes it pretty useless.  So I want to control the FTXM95PVMA with IR.

Like many A/C systems it uses a 'smart' remote control which doesn't merely send out a code for the button you press.  Instead, the remote itself keeps track of the desired temperature, etc., and instead each time \*any\* button is pressed on the remote the remote sends out \*all\* of the current settings to the A/C (i.e., fan settings, temp settings, etc...).  Someone said these are ""call mode"" based remotes, so the IR bridge needs to support that.

It should look neat, bare microcontrollers with dupont wires connecting receivers lying around will not have the requisite WAF. It probably needs to have a way to ""sniff"" and definitely needs a way to ""set"" the code.  It should use  (or be hackable to use) something like MQTT/ESPHome so it's easy to integrate.

Anyone been in the same situation with similar requirements but done something about it, what did you go with and would you do it differently now?

Thanks.

et2mrh,1579827193,Better way to control Samsung NU8000 TVs?,"I thought I would check with this community regarding (possibly) better ways to control my two NU8000 TV's. They also have Samsung bluetooth sound bars. They are mounted side by side, as me and my wife use them for gaming, or watching Twitch while watching TV, things like that. We use the Smart Things app through an old IPAD to control the TVs. The remotes that came with them are Bluetooth, and thus whatever you do with one TV, happens to the other. The benefit of the remotes is the fact they are fast. Smart Things through the IPAD is just a terribly slow process. The app resets to the Smart Things home page, so anytime I need to change the volume, I have to wake up the IPAD, wait for the app to show the status of the TVs, select the TV, and adjust the volume. Then go back and wait again, select the second TV, and do the same. Everything goes through the internet as well, so the latency of commands is pretty painful, especially when you first start, and the few times the Smart Things cloud has been down has resulted in digging out a remote and unplugging one TV so we can use the TV.

Preferably there would be an app or a physical remote we could use that didn't have giant Smart Things movie advertisements that I have to wait to load in the app, and that could very quickly switch and control the TVs as if they were local. It doesn't have to be free. I have home servers. I have RPi's. I love to DIY and tinker. But I'm also willing to buy an off the shelf solution if one exists. I know Harmony is tossed around, but I couldn't tell if it'd solve the problem with a bluetooth controlled TV.

et9fwh,1579867011,How would you approach designing and planning for home automation over a long timeline? (A request for help),"I need some help in my approach to automating a home. We are planning on this being a place we'll live in for most of our lives (we're even planning for old age, old parents, and old kids). It'll be new construction, larger side (3 story), so there will be logistical things to talk to the builder about that I've already picked up from reading over prior posts (conduit, a centralized closet/hub area, possible need for repeaters, running CAT, etc).

I'm really here to ask the community a more philosophical question about how to approach designing and planning for home automation over a long timeline.

My wife and I (in general) want to have a relatively future adaptable house (future proof is probably a stretch no matter how much you plan). People who are serious on this sub and other forums about a large/long term install seem to be very much in love with hardwiring switches, motion detectors, etc. Because I know technology will change, I want to make sure that I'm not hard wiring something that will be either worthless or a disaster to replace in 5-15 years versus having a good wireless equivalent that can be very easily changed if it does wear out or sell out (as opposed to having to 100% rely on a specialized service/technician to do anything more than something very basic).

Currently, we have Hue lights but the switches (not hardwired) do have a low but real fail rate and occasionally have lag. Hardwired smart lights with some areas using motion seems wonderful. The concern with hardwiring solutions is a) can ""hardwired"" smart switches work with something like Hue lights, and b) do solutions like Insteon that are highly regarded for reliability work out in the long run, will they have to be replaced every 10 years? I've read varying reviews/reports and it seems that some older issues have improved with better QC.

From everything I've read and thought about, I wonder if instead of hardwiring 100% (if hardwiring was made the gold standard  before wifi/etc could be made fast enough), I should consider using an ISY system to control the functions of mostly wireless vendors for our needs, i.e. lights (even with a mix of hardwired and wireless depending on cost and purpose), HVAC with zoning, some AV, exterior lighting, irrigation, CO detectors, and security cameras. I'm not enough of an enthusiast to want to put very expensive speakers in every room, but we already use Google Home/audio for whole home audio, intercom/broadcast, etc. and would plan to continue to use this generally.

Is there a long-lasting way to put in ""smart"" motion sensing lights and hubs? Would it be more reasonable to future proof with some simple switches and combination of more commercially available products tied into an ISY machine for future proofing (ISY seems to be the mother of all interoperable systems)?  It seems a bit foolish to blow the bank on a very nice Control4-esque solution that looks sleek but seems like it would need to be completely replaced to the tune of 10-15k every 10-20 years, right?",mjmed,/r/homeautomation/comments/et9fwh/how_would_you_approach_designing_and_planning_for/,1,homeautomation,5

Noob question but I just bought a Hubitat and was trying to set up my first rule on RM 4.0 and ran into some problems.

Hardware involved: 1 strip integrated through IFTTT using a virtual switch, 2 contact sensors on doors (1 zigbee, 1 Wyze integrated through IFTTT)

Aim: Upon either door opening, turn on the strip for 15 minutes provided the time is between 12 and 6 am (don't currently have a motion sensor so can't base turning on and off on motion)

Steps on Hubitat: created two rules, added zigbee contact sensor and virtual switch reflecting Wyze contact sensor state through IFTTT opening as triggers (1 each), went to actions, added condition (between 12-6 am as specific time range), added action to turn on virtual switch controlling light strip through IFTTT

Problem: set this up at night so I was pretty impressed with the fact that it was working on my first try, strip came on within about 5-6 seconds with zigbee sensor, took about 8-9 seconds with the Wyze sensor. But it worked. However, when I woke up (at around 8) I realised that even though the condition was false the strip kept getting turned on each time either door was open (basically the IF-THEN rule was disregarding the condition required for it proceed to then when the IF part was fulfilled). 

Not sure what I've done incorrectly here and would really appreciate some help as this is my first time working with this sort of interface and rule making outside of some fairly elementary tinkering on IFTTT.

I've been having problems with the original one not updating its status for open and close. Basically, id open the door, red light would come on and then turn off. When I closed it, the red light would come on for a ""long"" time, then turn off. This happens whenever I don't leave the door open for a longer period of time, which is mainly when leave or let the dogs out. If I leave the door open until the light turns off, it sees the closed event. 

Both sensors have the exact same issue. Though the aeotec does it less frequently where it misses the closed event.

My smartthings hub is in decent range, through two external walls but no more than 20ft apart. The other aeotec sensor is much further and is going through 3 walls, and a floor and has 0 issues.


The only thing I can think of is, there's a zwave dimmer switch like 3ft from the sensors. My suspicion is that the sensor is moving back and forth from a direct connection to the hub  to using the mesh or cant figure out which route to send the signal.

When we looked outside, we saw our garage light was on. We thought that was weird, since we didn‚Äôt remember leaving it on. Then a few minutes later, the garage light was turned back off. The only way to turn the garage light on is via flipping the switch or opening the garage door, after which it automatically shuts off. But our garage door was closed. (We do not have a sensor light.)

I have an infant and toddler, so was naturally a little freaked out. We called the police and they came and inspected all around the house. No sign of forced entry into the garage or footsteps in the garage. But we are still puzzled as to how the garage light could‚Äôve been turned on. 

This is the first incident we‚Äôve had with the doorbell or garage, and haven‚Äôt had any other phantom ringing since last night. 

Could both the doorbell AND the garage light somehow have been triggered by wireless interference? I know doorbells get triggered by interference often, but still can‚Äôt make sense of the light. 

We do have two wireless doorbells, one of which is by our entryway right next to the garage. 

I really appreciate anyone‚Äôs insight!",jacksmarie,/r/smarthome/comments/etg43h/the_phantom_doorbellgarage_light_incident_expert/,6,smarthome,11

eti0yn,1579906183,Switching from regular switches to smart dimmers - what do I do for 3 way switches if I want dimming control at both switches?,"So I want to outfit my new home with smart switches, but I am having a heck of a time finding a straight answer to my question. I have a house full of regular dumb toggle switches. I would like to replace them with smart (z-wave) dimmer switches. I'm aware of the issues of making sure I have the right bulbs (I have halogen currently, will eventually switch to LED). I think I'm reading that with a 3-way setup, I either need to get a a smart switch and a slave like the GE/Jasco ones, or a switch like the Zooz that works with existing 3 way switches. I was leaning Zooz, but my problem is, I have existing 3-way *toggle* switches, not existing dimmers. So I think I'm going to have to purchase new switches either way, I just want to know if I need to buy dumb switches, slaves, or what. Do I just order another Zooz switch? It seems like that might be an unnecessary expense, and the instructions kinda seem like it might not even work. I can't actually find what I need when I'm going from all dumb switches to all smart dimmers.

So my basic use case is: I want 18 Z-wave (or Zigbee) dimmers that I can have full control at both locations in a 3 way. I also need 15 regular 2 way switches and 3 bathroom fan switches. For WAF, they all need to look identical, so if there's an LED on one it needs to be on the other one (flexibility on this on the fan ones obviously). Some of them are going in a 4 gang spot if that matters for spacing. I have neutral wires on a house that was just wired to code 8 months ago. It would be neat if they had double tap and led customizability like the Zooz ones, but I'm open to whatever as long as it's a z-wave/zigbee repeater and is reliable.

Does anyone have any advice? Wiring doesn't frighten me, but I can't seem to figure out what I even need to order! Thanks so much.",drphungky,/r/homeautomation/comments/eti0yn/switching_from_regular_switches_to_smart_dimmers/,2,homeautomation,8

etjd9q,1579912264,Best approach for integrating Alexa everywhere -- PoE and Fire tablets?,"We're building a custom home, and I'm doing all the A/V (I'm pretty experienced with most aspects of it). We have become heavy Alexa users over the past few years. The new home has a somewhat modern design aesthetic, so I'm looking to hide and integrate things wherever possible.

In that vein, I would like to not have little Echo pods sitting around everywhere. 

For rooms that don't require screens (like an Echo Show), I'm thinking of using kits [like these](https://www.htd.com/dotkit_2) to invisibly install Echo Inputs (or Echo Dots). It installs in the ceiling, has a cover that makes it look like a speaker, and uses a single Cat6 to run power and return audio (the rooms will also have built-in audio, so this returns audio from the Echo to a central closet). The plan here is to have Alexa be the whole-house audio controller (it will all be wired to a central closet, so Alexa could be replaced with something else later should we choose), and from any room you could play music using group commands.

https://preview.redd.it/2ojdwkx1jtc41.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592034d1890f42be2b8972b4e08e927d6fda1cd1

However, in other areas (like the kitchen/family room) we like our Echo Show -- the screen is quite useful sometimes. Plus I wouldn't mind having an always-on status display that I could build with Home Assistant or something. So for these areas, I'm considering getting some Fire Tablet HD 8s, which appear to have the same functionality as an Echo Show -- Alexa with a screen. I'd use the same PoE/AoE approach as the Echo Dots, and [mount them using a wall mount frame like this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/626680352/amazon-fire-hd-8-2-parts-mount-tablet?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=fire+tablet+mount&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-3&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1&amp;col=1). Similar to the screenless rooms, the audio would be amplified and returned over in-ceiling speakers. Each location just needs a Cat6 cable and a single-gang box in the wall, so again it's relatively ""reversible"" if later I decide Fire Tablets aren't the right thing.

My questions are:

1. Does anyone use Fire Tablets like this, and if so how is the mic pickup? The main concern I have with this is that I imagine the tablet mic isn't as good as the array of microphones on a real Echo Show.
2. Related to #1, is there any way to have one Echo (like an Input or a Dot) used as an add-on mic for an Echo Show device?
3. Should I be worried about battery swelling or fires if the Fire (ha) is always plugged in via PoE?
4. Generally speaking are there any major flaws with this plan or better ways to accomplish what I want?",rogersmj,/r/homeautomation/comments/etjd9q/best_approach_for_integrating_alexa_everywhere/,2,homeautomation,7

I have a seemingly simple automation I'm trying to achieve, but I'm not sure where to go and which tools to use to make it happen. 

I have a motion sensor and a smart switch controlling a light, both on the Smart Life App. The automation is simply: When it's night time, trigger the hallway light for 30 second if motion is detected... 

Works great, but the little wrinkle I want to add is, I ONLY want this sequence to trigger when the light in a room in the hallway is off. Meaning, don't turn the hallway light on, if the room light is already on. 

How do I go about this? I thought it'd be as simple as making sure ALL conditions are met in the Smart Life built in app, where the room light needs to be off AND motion is detected, then turn on the hallway light when it's night time. 

Can anyone tell me how to do this? Do I need to use IFTTT, Tasker? Or what?

&amp;#x200B;

Please feel free to direct me to appropriate resources. I am not having any luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my equipment set up:

\- A Wink hub from 3 years ago

\- A bunch of GE Smart Switches from 3 years ago. Most lights I want voice control.

\- A bunch of Philips Hue bulbs with a bridge

\- 2 FEIT smart switches (from Costco?)

\- 2 Arlo wireless cams

\- 7 Alexas

\- 2 Nest Thermostats

\- 1 Harmony Hub (For TV/Receiver in home theater setup)

\- 2 Tuyasmart IR blasters (For 2 Samsung TVs)

\- TPLink M5 3 node Mesh network with ethernet back haul

\- All screens/Xbox/Apple TV are hardwired

&amp;#x200B;

Most of this mess was under relative control until I added the IR Blasters for my other two TVs and the FEIT Switch. 

My issue is around voice integration from Alexa to the various endpoints. I have now added two new items containing the word TV and am trying to get a group around basement lights which are GE and FEIT devices. 

Does anyone have a set of best practices around this as it has to be a standard use case? I'm a bit lost if I should create groups in Hue, Wink or only in Alexa. Is there any way to limit certain voice commands only to the nearest Alexa?

Being in the obligatory situation where I want to upgrade my TV and AV receiver, I, of course, want to go with ""smart"" devices. Doing a general Google search yielded nothing to help guide this journey.

Currently, I am using a Harmony hub to automate all the AV stuff. It's integrated with Alexa so I can turn on theater mode by voice, etc. I assume most of you are doing something similar. That said, it works okay, but not perfectly. Specifically, it's uni-directional, so it doesn't know if my receiver or TV are on, what inputs they are on, and thus issues commands when they are not necessary, and sometimes turns the devices off when switching inputs. It's smart, but not quite as ""smart"" as it could be.

It seems ""obvious"" to me that the harmony hub concept should be built into a modern receiver. Thus it would know the state of all other components and coordinate them all. It would use a phone app as the remote and in addition to triggering commands could show you the current state (e.g. what device is currently being displayed.) Maybe it could even integrate with Smartthings so a physical switch could activate states. I cannot find a receiver with this kind of intelligence.

Also, given that all these new TV's are smart with built-in apps, it should be able to pass audio to and to a degree control the receiver so sound (volume adjustments) are made to the receiver and the TV will have its built-in speakers permanently disabled.

Is anyone able to recommend products that might be in this category that I am unable to locate? Is Harmony Hub the best option we still have?

I was wondering if anyone has experience of either the Sensibo or IntesisHome AC control solution? I was about to go and buy the Sensibo as it seems to get positive reviews, but then I realised my Mitsubishi Heavy AC splits are compatible if I buy a WiFi add on. Sadly whilst I can find plenty of (positive) Sensibo reviews, I can't find much about the IntesisHome!

From what I can tell:
**Sensibo**

*Pros* - Cheaper ($140 per unit) good user experience, extra features (e.g. Geofencing)

*Cons* - Needs external mounting where it can 'see' the AC to control it via IR. Only one way comms, that is it can't get a response from the AC unit, works like a universal remote.

**IntesisHome**

*Pros* - mounts inside the AC head unit, connects directly to the control board so nothing external and can read the AC status (although not sure how useful this is)

*Cons* - More expensive ($200 per unit), from what have read isn't a well supported app or user experience.

Any advice would be welcome!

The lights do flicker constantly right now so I am wondering if the existing wiring may not be correct? But in any event - wanted to see if anyone could help comment on what would be the correct way to go about installing the smart dimmer switch.

Do the two white wires, that I assume are neutrals, need to be capped together and connected to the new smart dimmer? Also, do the two unused wires in the wall need to be capped as well and connected to the smart dimmer to avoid the flickering issues?

It also makes the beeping sound that it only makes when you close it from the app. The alert shows me it was triggered from a scheduled open but we never set schedules. The schedule was set for every day of the week at 1 am. Has anyone else ran into this problem?

eum4rx,1580120412,How to disable certain routines at certain times of day so the wife doesn‚Äôt kill me when the bedroom lights turn on at 2am?,"As the title says, in a recent echo update, I feel like Alexa‚Äôs voice recognition has gotten somehow dumber. 


Backstory: my wife is super energy conservative. I have a history of falling asleep very quickly and at random times, and I like to game late at night in the living room. I fall asleep so fast that I forget to turn off the lights. Hence, in a passive aggressive (but awesome) mood, she created routines to turn off lights at 1, 2, 3, and 4 am. I have to use voice to turn the lights back on if I‚Äôm playing games. I have lutron and Hue throughout my house.
 
The problem: recently, I said ‚Äúcomputer, turn on living room lights‚Äù after they auto shut off at 1 am. To my horror, the bedroom lights turned on instead! My wife is an early sleeper, so she was in full on deep sleep, and didn‚Äôt notice before I opened the lutron app and shut them off. 

Not a week later, she and I were up on a Sunday night and she tried to get the echo to turn on the living room lights, when the echo registered ‚Äúturn on ALL lights‚Äù. We have a roommate that works M-F at 5am, and was fast asleep. It turned on ALL LIGHTS. Again, I worked fast and turned his lights off, but that could have been bad. Think, hibernating bear is woken up early kind of bad. 

My solution: I renamed our bedroom ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù in the app, because ‚Äúmaster‚Äù and ‚Äúliving room sound NOTHING alike. 

My desired outcome: I would like to set a routine that says ‚Äúbetween the hours of 10pm and 7am, voice command ‚Äúturn on _____ CANNOT BE USED‚Äù. Therefore, if Alexa registers that I said turn on all lights, she‚Äôd return ‚Äúthat command cannot be used at this time of night‚Äù or something. 

If no such thing exists, what do you guys think is a halfway decent solution for this? 

PS. I have considered that maybe I was drunk one night and slurred my words when giving a voice command, however my wife and I both tried it while sober and being articulate several times and triggered it at least once. Our roommate regularly manages to turn on the bedroom fan as well instead of the living room fan. All three of us are English only with no accent to speak of.

eun1tc,1580126766,Help needed conntecting a smart doorbell to an existing intercom system,"Reddit,

I need your help connecting a Nello smart doorbell. ([https://www.nello.io/en/](https://www.nello.io/en/).)). This is a smart doorbell that you can connect on top off your existing intercom system. I live in a flat and that thing isn't going to be replaced anytime soon. The intercom phone I have is a Atea NOV 903.

Unfortunately, both Nello and Atea went out of business. Someone bought Nello and keeps the servers running but it seems no one is managing the support e-mail.

The Nello app has instruction on how to connect the Nello to the board of your intercom phone but it seems the instructions for my model are off. These are the instructions on how to connect the wires: [http://i.imgur.com/qfUEoo8.png](http://i.imgur.com/qfUEoo8.png) You can tell something is off because my connector only has 8 connections. [http://i.imgur.com/yY4CAVg.png](http://i.imgur.com/yY4CAVg.png)

Trying out different combinations I got the app to be able to 'buzz' open te main front door but I can't get it to detect when a bell rings.

In the Nello One manual I found the following: [http://i.imgur.com/ntq3afG.png](http://i.imgur.com/ntq3afG.png)

In an old manual for my phone I found this: [http://i.imgur.com/YwZc3DE.png](http://i.imgur.com/YwZc3DE.png)

Could be that the Nello people changed NOV 903 (my phone) to NOV 802E, the one with 8 connectors. But I can't get it to work with that either.

From the manual it seems I should connect the doorbell detection cable to connector 1, but that doesn't work either.

eusjw2,1580151783,What do do next.,"Hey guys!  


I just finished setting up my latest smart-home project.   
(Face recognition at the door with alerts and anouncements).  


And I must admit that I don't know what else to add at this point, for reference, this what I have setup so far:  


Hardware:

    30 RGB Wifi bulbs ( I plan on replacing those with Sengled Zwaves ones as they break down)( 27 of those run Tasmota-Sonoff)
    
    10 Google Mini( One per room and some rooms have 2)
    4 Chromecast.
    12 Xiaomi motion sensors (They are used to turn on the lights automatically)
    5 Xiaomi Humidity/Temp sensor ( One in most rooms and one outside )
    6 Xiaomi door sensors (Bathroom,Fridge door, Front/Back door and the bedrooms)
    2 Xiaomi Hubs (For the range)
    1 Xiaomi Button (For the doorbell)
    1 Sonoff Basic (Turns on the BAthroom fan when the bathroom humidity goes over 60%)
    6 Teckin 15Amps smart plugs (3 on Tasmotta-Sonoff) (For lamps and computer screens)
    1 Samsung Smart Things hub coupled with 1 Schlague Lock
    3 Unifi AP with one USG
    1 poweredge server
    1 Reolink POE Camera
    1 Wyzecam v2
    6 esp32 (For per room location using BLE and a fitbit) (thinking of getting 6 raspbery pi 0w for this )

Software:

    Home-Assistant
    Node-Red (Most automations run there)
    Machinebox/Facebox ( Face recognition )
    
    Plex (Along with Sonarr,Radarr,Lidarr,Filebot and Transmission for automated content acquisition)
    
    Grafana
    Assistant Relay (to broadcast announcements to the Minis without stopping the music)
    Pihole
    Xiaomi2Mqtt
    NGINX (For remote access to home-assistant)
    MotionEye 
    
    OpenMqttGateway (On the esp32s )

Automations:

    All lights are tied to motion sensors.
    
    All the lights turn to green for 3 seconds when the front door is unlocked from the outside.
    An announcement is also broadcasted with the name of the person that arrived.
    A notification is also sent through android with the name of the person that arrived
    
    All the lights turn to blue for 4 seconds when someone press the doorbell
    The speakers also announce who is there using face recognition
    A notification is also sent to the phones with a picture and the name of the person.
    
    The bathroom starts music upon entering (at 10% volume if the door stays open)
    The bathroom lights stay on as long as the bathroom humidity is over 60% humidity (so the lights don't go out mid shower)
    
    The front door lock itself after 4 minutes
    
    The fridge door sensors let us know if teh fridge door stays open more than 2 minutes as it often miss-close,
    
    The front and back door let us know when they are open for more than 3 minutes, and then remind us every 2 minutes. as to not let too much warthm outside
    
    The alarm system (home assistant coupled with the motion sensors) goes on when all the users (Detected using nmap ont he wifi) leave.
    It also goes down when the front door is unlocked and that one of us is on the wifi.
    
    
    The appartment can tell in which room I am using my watch and 6 esp32s (this is highly experimental and shouldn't be use alone for now)

I am planing on doing conditioning soon (Getting electric heaters installed soon and will be using zwave thermostats )  


Other than that, I have no idea as to what to add.  
Are the robovacs worth the costs?  


I am looking for any idea that could be fun or just nice to implement.   
I am also happy to hear any automation idea that can be done with my current hardware!

I am currently debating the best course of action for a water-main shut off valve system triggered by water sensors. I have upstairs laundry which, if the water feed was compromised, would cause massive damage to the home.

Currently I have a twist style water shut off. I recognize both of these avenues would require a plumber.

I‚Äôm debating a ‚ÄúDome‚Äù style motorized shut off that sits on top of a 1/4 turn valve (which I would need to install)


Or

An electric/solenoid valve that runs in line, that when powered by a z-wave / smart things outlet would power the solenoid closed. When sensors detected water. This is the cheaper of both systems.

I currently have a nest thermostat and several lifx light bulbs. I love my setup. My phone is the controller for everything--I use IFTTT for controlling the lighting and let nests app control the thermostat. I have a pretty extensive set of IFTTT commands for my lights, I use them heavily. 

I'm moving in with my girlfriend soon though, and she will need to be able to control these things too. I could probably find some solution using our phones, but I'm tempted to get us a real controller.

Thing is, I know nothing about them. I haven't spent much time researching them. So I'm here!

What I need is a controller with the ability to automate the scenes you can create in lifx, as well as the thermostat (to a more limited degree). Several questions:

1. Do any of the major controller hubs have buttons similar to those of IFTTT? Where I make a button widget, program it do do a specific thing, then press it and have it happen? 

2. Do any of them work with UEBoom Bluetooth speakers? I have one of those, having it turn itself on in the morning would be neat, but unnecessary.

I then went onto Costco and checked out their custom order, but you install yourself Bali shades.  Still going to be about **$8 - 9k** but obviously better.

Finally I stumbled on Blindsgalore.com.  They sell rebranded Comfortex shades as their in house brand and they are exactly what I was looking for.

**And the best part -- I got everything -- blinds, remotes, and smart hub for under $4,700!**

They also have a nice policy where you can f-up measurements on up to 4 blinds and they'll just send you a replacement (I used it on one blind and zero hassle).

I‚Äôm buying a new build home which is coming up to the 1st fix stage, so deciding what I want in terms of home automation. I‚Äôm planning on using Home Assistant as the controller with Amazon Echos for voice control as I want as much local control as possible, although I am concerned about the GAF - Girlfriend Approval Factor. I considered Control4 for peace of mind but will probably be out of budget.

Here is an overview of my plans so far:

Infrastructure

* Cat 6 to every room.
* More power sockets than needed
* speaker cable to rooms required
* Running a freenas server and a couple VMs
* Unifi network/wifi
* Tablet in main rooms for control

Lighting:

This is where I need advice. I‚Äôm waiting for confirmation if there will be neutral wires in the switches. I want to have physical wall switches for guests etc. Would also like to build automations so will need sensors

* No Neutral - Fibaro dimmers? Lutron RA2? Any others to consider?
* Neutral - Any suggestions if there is a neutral wire?

I would also like smart blinds in some rooms, Ikea FYRTUR seem like a good option

Heating: Tado thermostat and TRVs. I‚Äôve read I can use Home Assistant for Geofencing to save paying the subscription.

security:

CCTV - Unifi Cameras (use them in current house). 

Door locks - Looking for a smart deadbolt lock. I like the Schlage Connect but I don‚Äôt think these are available in the UK. Plus the US Z wave version wouldn‚Äôt be compatible in the UK, correct? Any other suggestions?

Alarm - Planning on having an alarm system but unsure if I want this integrated with HA. I‚Äôve looked at the Texecom Connect but I don‚Äôt think this can be integrated. If not I'll add fibaro or aeotec sensors 

Multi Zone Audio

Up to 6 zones, 3 with in-ceiling speakers, 1 outdoor. Planning on using Sonos, using Sonos Amps for in-ceiling speakers and outdoor speakers, then can add Sonos Ones to rooms if needed.

Appliances:

Roborock S6

Smart plug with energy monitoring to determine if washing machine/dishwasher is running or finished.

Is there anything else I should consider? Are my options able to be integrated with HA?

1. Raspberry Pi 3B (headless)
2. Home Assistant via Docker
3. Aeotec Z-Wave stick plugged into rear USB
4. No SD card. Boots from spinning platter hard drive using [this hardware](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32791789269.html) and [this method](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md).

6. Running Raspbian Buster Lite
7. Ethernet connection to network (but same behavior with wifi)

**The Problem**

The Pi is really picky about whether it will boot, either from a cold start or command line reboot. Here's the truth table for this Pi's boot preferences:

Z-Wave Stick Connected | HDMI Monitor Connected| Will Boot?
---|---|----
False | False | True
True | False | False
False| True | True
True | True | True

When the system fails to boot, it powers on but doesn't pull an IP address. I've tried connecting a monitor when it is in this on-but-not-booted state, but the screen just goes to sleep.

It's a strange issue, and it's just frustrating to work on this server remotely... or honestly, just from my couch. Every time I reboot, I need to go into the server closet, pull out the z-wave stick, trigger the reboot, wait for the system to fully boot, plug in the z-wave stick, restart home assistant.

I'm technically proficient. I've tried too many debugging steps to list and even attempted a ground up format and reinstall of the entire system.

Apologies if anything in here sounds very wrong or dumb, I'm new at this and I'm trying to learn.  

My current network setup for this question is very simple: I have an EdgeRouter X, connected to that are two raspberry pi's. One running Home Assistant and one running Nginx as a reverse proxy / webserver.  

Home Assistant is home automation software with a bunch of integrations, including Google Assistant. To activate this integration Google Cloud needs to be able to access that raspberry pi using a domain name/port and a valid SSL certificate.  

(ports used as an example)  
My current setup that I have thought out is as follows:

* Namecheap domain with dynamic dns
* EdgeRouter configured to update NameCheap with the ip
* EdgeRouter configured using NAT to forward ports 12345 and 80/443 to the nginx reverse proxy
* Nginx configured to use letsencrypt to issue valid certificates to the domain
* Nginx configured to redirect port 12345 to the raspberry pi running homassistant
* Nginx configured to use port 80 to access a website

So for the Google Assistant integration I would tell Google Cloud to find my Home Assistant on mydomain.com:12345. But if I browse to https://mydomain.com/ it would show my website?

Does anything I typed out here sound dumb? Is there any way this would/wouldn't work? Am I forgetting something?

ev7h47,1580227977,"LED Strip Beginner, Power Supply Question","Hello everyone,

I have recently embarked on the HA bandwagon (HASS.io, custom Linux server, various smart bulbs, etc.) and am having a blast so far. I now want to start something that is completely new to me: led strips. Please bear with me, as I am starting from scratch and learning as I go.

I want to start with a small project of adding 2 meters of white task lighting over our kitchen sink. I don't need something particularly durable or rugged, as this is just a starter project, mostly to get me acquainted with the basics.

I have chosen [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32867670930.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.4ba1716bUhYDWs&amp;algo_pvid=e28e0270-d549-4581-88df-65677d867291&amp;algo_expid=e28e0270-d549-4581-88df-65677d867291-18&amp;btsid=bb8a55c9-38ad-4662-9762-c658385858e1&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_4,searchweb201603_53) white LED strip, at a density of 240 LEDs per meter, IP65.

It's my understanding that I can use only the terminals that I need on the controller (power and CW), so that shouldn't be an issue.

Where I'm unsure is the power supply. At first I was thinking of powering everything through USB, but seeing as that is limited to 5V, I quickly realized that this won't work. According to my calculations, if each LED draws 0.2 watts, then 2 meters should draw 96 watts at max power. At 12 volts, that means that I need a 12V AC/DC power supply that is rated for 8A, similar to [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32794814341.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.58f67415dlbf2Z&amp;s=p&amp;algo_pvid=298252e6-c37d-4b09-9123-c1b36eaf2784&amp;algo_expid=298252e6-c37d-4b09-9123-c1b36eaf2784-0&amp;btsid=f498bf89-853d-4333-8ddc-ba6d261e8f58&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_4,searchweb201603_53).

ev8mal,1580233057,Best way to alert if front door is left open,"I just bought a house and have been in and out fixing things up until I move in. Twice now in the past month I've either left the back door unlocked or completely open after leaving, so I'm stepping into home automation for the first time.

After I left the door unlocked the first time, I bought a set of Schlage Connect locks (not installed yet) and a smartthings hub thinking it would be the perfect way to lock the doors remotely. However, I'm not sure if they'll be useful for doors that have been left open. I'm guessing I could leave a door open, hit the lock button remotely, and the app will assume the door is shut when it's actually wide open with the deadbolt sticking out.

I found that the August Pro has a built in sensor for open doors and am thinking about returning the Schlage Connects and replacing them with August locks. Is there a better solution?

I normally go in through the garage with a garage door opener, so the locks are more for notifications and remote control for when I forget to close/lock a door after letting my dog out rather than actually entering/exiting the house. The keypad on the Schlage locks is nice for when I want to give my parents/friends/contractor a code without having to explain to them how to use their phone to get in with August locks; everyone knows how to use a keypad. Other than that, I don't see any major differences between the two that would affect me much, but I wanted to check here and see if there's an easier solution.",puddle_stomper,/r/homeautomation/comments/ev8mal/best_way_to_alert_if_front_door_is_left_open/,1,homeautomation,7

evawob,1580242645,Aeotec Doorbell 6 Button Mod,"EDIT: New link for pics with the doorbell mounted on the wall!

Pics here: http://imgur.com/gallery/E8g61wb
Sorry for the potato pics, I didn't think to take pictures beforehand. 

I wanted to use the Aeotec Doorbell 6 (Christmas present) as a full replacement into my home. Though I did not like the idea of a battery powered button which was cheap and plastic. Also, don't want someone walking up and just pulling it off the house and running away with it. 

So for the approx $15 I bought another and tore it apart. Soldered wires over the button pads, and connected it to my existing button. And it works like a champ! 

I took it 1 step further and ran power to the button and doorbell too. From the 16VAC transformer that was already in my basement I added a Smakn AC/DC to DC 12V converter. This thing is genius, and quite useful. 

Luckily I was fortunate enough to have separate sets of wires, one to the button outside, and the other to the module on the wall. I ran 12V up to the wall where I reduced it to 5V, and plugged it into the doorbell module.

I then split the 12V to 3.3V down by the source and connected it to the button over the VCC and GND terminals on the circuit. 

Now I have the wireless doorbell button inside, but the nice weatherproof button outside (and it matches my door handles). Also note, mine had a little light in it. I disconnected that as there is no longer power going to it, but rather just shorting 2 pins when pressed. Not sure how it would work with the little bulb in there, but mine was gone before testing. 

Just wanted to share as there is virtually no info on these buttons, and honestly it doesn't seem like it's too commonly used in general. And I'm going to stick my second button in my garage as we have a walk in door which sometimes gets accidentally locked. That way the ol lady can ring it at my to come unlock (as she is much to lazy to use her keys lol).",Kleinja,/r/smarthome/comments/evawob/aeotec_doorbell_6_button_mod/,8,smarthome,4

evrmuo,1580325722,Using a Shelly to control an Extractor Fan,"Hey,

In my house we're moving towards Hue, because we're in the UK, our light switches don't have neutrals and the ability to change the colour and dim is really good (think bathroom at night!)

The main issue preventing me from doing this though, is Extractor Fans. We have extractor fans that come on when the light is switched on and then stay on for ~5 minutes after the light is switched off.

We also have an isolator switch before it hits the fan for safety.

I want to make the fans smart, so a) I can switch them on until the humidity drops to a level I'm happy with and b) so I can install hue lights in the room and not have the fan be on permanently.

This is how these fans are usually wired in the UK:
http://www.ultimatehandyman.co.uk/diy/electrics/extractor_fan/SHOWER_EXTRACTOR_FAN_25.jpg

Note the Live and Switched Live going to the fan, I believe this is so the fan will always get power no matter if the light is on or off, and the fan will then know if the light is on or not (so to start the timer if it's turned off)

Also this is the one switch that will have neutral, so I can use Shellys etc here.

I'm not an expert in electrics by any means, but I have done some small wiring jobs, how could I wire in a Shelly in order so that the Isolation switch will always work and override Shelly (for safety), and that the fan will essentially be completely controlled by Shelly, not caring about the Light switch, so I can start writing rules for when the fan should be on or off.

Would this sort of thing work?
https://imgur.com/a/zgXWsu9

My thinking is, after the isolator switch, combine the Live and Switched Live (because I want the shelly to always have power no matter what the state of the light switch), and then just hook up to the switched live on the extractor fan, so if shelly is providing it power it is on, and if shelly switches it off, it comes off - with no timer functions in play.

Also I'm open for other devices, never used a shelly before - I have a zigbee network, so if there's a zigbee equivalent for the UK I'd probably rather use that!

evs59u,1580327735,Smart switches (fan + light),"Hello. I just bought a Google Nest Hub (two of them!) from Best Buy's Deal of the Day yesterday and am wanting to install some smart switches, which I assume would be cheaper than buying new smart bulbs for all the lights.

I live in Texas so we have a lot of ceiling fans on the same switch as the light switch. Well, they're different switches but attached to the same panel, you know what I mean. Are there any smart switches that can replace this panel? If possible, I'd like it to pretty much be the same thing, except smarter. I assume light switches and fan switches are not the same.

I just bought a Philips Hue Start Kit with 2 bulbs off eBay for $30, but realized soon after that you need to keep the light switch on in order to use these bulbs correctly. This is another reason why I think smart switches are the easier way to go... as long as the same switch panel can control a fan too.

Also, are these things easy to set up? Would you need any special tools? If it's just a matter of replacing wires then I think I can figure it out, but if special tools are needed or something then I think I would have some difficulty.

The kitchen lights have two separate light switches that control the same lights. Would the smart switches conflict with each other if both dumb switches were replaced?

‚Ä¢ A somewhat simple UI where I can easily set up lights, routines etc.  
‚Ä¢ Cheap (I‚Äôm a student).  
  
I looked into IKEAs gateway, however it seems like it is pretty bad?

Then the Philips bridge came up, however I‚Äôm also not 100% sure about Google Home voice control, and does it work with fx cheap Xiaomi sensors?  
I have a Raspberry Pi 3 I‚Äôm not using, so Home Assistant is also a possibility if I can get a step-by-step guide to set it up - I am under the impression that this is the ultimate hub, right? But then again, I believe I read that you need a subscription for Google Home to work? This seems like my cheapest option now that I already have the Pi. I am a bit scared though as it looks like I need to ‚Äúcode‚Äù stuff to add lights and such; I would like to set up the stuff by clicking, draging etc. I know enough so that I have set up my Raspberry Pi as a PS1, so not totally in the dark.

[This is the wiring beneath the thermostat](https://imgur.com/a/fIwYMRY)

I live in a townhouse, and the complex management has given me the go-ahead to swap out the existing thermostat for a smart one (provided I don't damage any complex property, and replace it if/when I eventually move) -- but I don't know if the existing wiring is compatible with any of them. I did use the ""compatbility checkers"" of the ones I was interested in, and they yielded the following results:

I recently got a bluetooth smart lock so i can just enter a code on a keypad to enter my door instead of fumbling around for keys. 

Because of my door's locking mechanism (Mortisse lock) I got a Gimdow Smart Lock, that primarily uses Bluetooth as it's protocol.  One drawback to that is that i can't get any notifications when the lock engages or is unlocked.  

I'm trying to DIY a solution and maybe you guys can chime in with suggestions.

The idea i have currently is to hack a Wyze contact sensor to determine if the lock is engaged. The bolt would depress a switch on the box on the door frame.

One of the fans we have though isn't a timed one, it's a simple fan that you turn on and off with a switch. I've taken the cover off the fan to see what power we're dealing with and I don't quite get it

I see Neutral and I presume Switched Live, that's fine - but what is the yellow cable in the box? Is that a permanent Live?

If there's not a permie Live in the box, I suppose I'll have to wire it after the switch which isn't ideal as the switch will turn it off.

I speak Dutch. When I want so search - in English - for a smart thing to open my garage door, I look for ""smart garage door opener"". All I can find is crap to put on existing motors.  
When I look for ""smart garage door motor"", I find mostly the same links.

Is there no such thing? Am I obligated to buy a new dumb opener, and then fiddle with crap to make it smart afterwards?

*Update* I went with a Raspberry Pi 4 based system with a ZigBee dongle made by someone in the HASS.io community. I'm running Home Assistant (hass.io) and have set up a few IKEA Tradfri bulbs and switches, no Tradfri hub required. It's working well so far. Next project is probably a basic doorbell if I can find a nice button to put on the front door and something to make noises in a few places around the house. Thanks everyone for advice.

ewcvq0,1580420609,I made a WiFi scale to tell me how much filament is left on my 3D printer. It also does Temp/Humidity with MQTT for Home Assistant,"Of course, it can be used to weight things other than filament *cough*drugs*cough*. And it has a really crappy looking, but very functional web interface to calibrate and tare the scale. It also has a settings page to be able to configure various things like the offset(for the spool in my case) or small increases in weight, which happen when the printer pulls on the filament. It's based on the ESP8266/Wemos D1 Mini. Once you upload the code to the ESP, everything from then on can be setup from your smartphone. 

I recently added MQTT and a BME280 temperature/humidity/pressure sensor. I am using MQTT to be able to pull the data into Home Assistant. I plan on using that to notify me about the filament getting low. It also has a page that present all the sensor data in JSON format. I plan on using that with my OctoPrint plugin which I just completed(but I need to clean it up a little before publishing it). 

The scale is pretty accurate. For something that is around 1kg, it might be off by a gram or 2 compared to my kitchen scale. 

If there is any more interest, I plan on adding more sensors to this project. I'm thinking it will be a smoke sensor to let me know when my printer catches on fire and to have OctoPrint automatically turn off the smartplug connected to it. Maybe a filament runout sensor as well. 

Let me know what you guys think. I'm always looking for any criticism to make my projects better.

ewhzb9,1580441019,Wifi Connected Dimmable Smart Bulb with Motion Sensor??,"Hello Magicians of Home Automation!

My mother expressed to me that she would like to simply walk around and have her lights come on for her, so I am obliging. So far I have purchased a few smart plugs, a few smart bulbs, and a Smart PIR sensor which finally arrived today! 

I am doing my best to make the Change as simplified for my father, who doesn't want to lose control of the switch function or have problems if the wifi goes out. 

I have discovered LED ""Smart"" Bulbs with motion sensing PIR, which will turn the light on  when close, and off when no motion is detected in 45 seconds. I like this idea, as it gives them both the on/off function for movement with out additional sensors all over the house. My Concern with this solution is: Wifi connectivity for customization, Dimmability, and Power usage. 

For reference there are about 20 Bulbs I have interest in replacing.

&amp;#x200B;

Wifi Connectivity: Is there such an all in one bulb? Dimmable, Wifi Connected, Motion Sensing Smart bulb? So far I am unsure if any I have found are Wifi connected, although I have found Smart Sockets that can turn a regular bulb into a smart Bulb, though I have not seen any indication of dimmability within connected apps.

Dimmability: There is another room past my parents bedroom. They usually leave their door open at night, thus if a person/guest is to walk to or from that room I wouldn't want the light to come on at full force and wake them up. 

Power Usage: If a person turns the switch off that controls a smart bulb with a motion sensor will it also turn off the power to the bulb, thus eliminating the motion sensing function?

&amp;#x200B;

I know 20 bulbs is a big price, and if I had to get Smart Sockets that price would double. The only alternative to me would be using a Sonoff Mini and a bunch of PIR motion sensors. As with the Latter, is there such a PIR sensor that would act similar to the bulb and turn off a light when no movement is detected for 45 seconds?

I am totally open to all suggestions, ideas, work-arounds, and what ever you think! Thanks for reading and your support!",safailla,/r/homeautomation/comments/ewhzb9/wifi_connected_dimmable_smart_bulb_with_motion/,0,homeautomation,2

ewpx6m,1580484074,Help me get started with smart switches tied to motion detectors,"Hi - I am completely new to home automation and honestly I've never had a ton of interest in the subject. However, I have a couple of pain points with lighting in my home and hoping for suggestions on specific products to buy because I don't know where to get started. Specifically, I'm looking for a smart switch that is activated by an external motion detector that will turn on lights when someone is present and turn off after a period of no motion.

Location 1: Garage lights - I have a 3 gang switch on the inside of my house to turn on the lights in the garage. I swear somehow these lights are always left on and it drives me crazy. I would like them to come on whenever I go into the garage (entering or exiting the house) but turn off when no one is there. Our garage only has small windows from the garage door so even in daylight it is fairly dark in there. 

Location 2: Step Lights - I currently have step lights set up on a timer style switch that just does a dusk to dawn timer. Its kind of dumb to have these lights on while we are sleeping, but the intent is in the middle of the night to have visibility in case someone is going up/down steps. Same thing as the garage - I'd like to set these up on a motion detector, but ideally that motion detector would only be active from dusk to dawn.

Location 3: Pantry - same as above, lights always seem to be left on, would like to activate via a motion detector...this one is likely easier because I could set it up with a traditional ""non-smart"" motion detector since it is a small area, but if I'm buying smart stuff I might as well set this up.

As previously mentioned, I don't have a smart ecosystem in my house so open to any suggestions; however, the less complicated the better. House was built in the last 5 years so wiring shouldn't be an issue and we use iphones if that matters.

I have been thinking about diving into SharpTools and mounting a tablet on the wall but I wanted to check in with you guys and see how you like it first (I really hate putting holes in the wall).  

Here are my constraints:

I have about 30 Lutron switches or plugs throughout the house, a smart lock, nest thermostat, nest protects, nest camera, ring cameras, echos, and a SmartThings Hub.  I also have a harmony remote which I don't currently use.  

My overall hope is to use it as a sort of security system by eventually adding a few motion sensors as well as door sensors and utilizing SmartThings to arm and disarm. 

However, the reason I haven't taken the plunge yet is primarily because 99% of the items I'd be able to control are lights and those are already controlled via Alexa (or Pico Switch).  Also, I really like the idea of accessing the Nest and Ring cameras through the dashboard but it doesnt look like thats possible.  

For those that have mounted a tablet and used sharptools, do you think I'm in a position that would benefit from having a similar setup?  What are you primiarily using it for?  How has it benefited you in ways that voice commands/smart phone can't?  

...Basically, I need a practicality pitch for my wife...

Thanks in advance.",AssDimple,/r/homeautomation/comments/ewual6/thinking_about_diving_into_sharptools_and/,6,homeautomation,16
ewucpm,1580502327,Combining dimmable single pole switch and 3 pole regular switch,"I bought the TP link dimmable switch and TP link 3 pole switch, which from what I‚Äôve heard you only need 1 of the 3 pole switches to do a 3 way connection. So my question is if I combined the two switches, would I be able to dim the light and also have it work on two switches? As soon as they‚Äôre delivered I‚Äôm testing it out but I want to check my logic here.",Boylan96,/r/homeautomation/comments/ewucpm/combining_dimmable_single_pole_switch_and_3_pole/,4,homeautomation,1

Im finally getting around to changing the locks on my new house from standard locks to a smart lock. What are my options and what do you all recommend. I've heard good things about Schlage but even they have so many options so not too sure. Also I am not sure what would even work for me as I have a deadbolt and a door knob with a lock as well. 

Please advise. Currently the only other smart device I have is a Nest Thermostat. I will look into expanding my smart home in the future with a doorbell camera and floodlights.",SportsNFoodJunkie,/r/smarthome/comments/ewvw64/convert_locks_to_smart_locks/,3,smarthome,10

I have a lamp that takes a R7S bulb and has a dimmer switch on it. Currently it's on a regular smart socket but I'd like to be able to control the brightness as well.
I can't find smart R7S bulbs anywhere so wondered if I could do it from the socket but I'm not having any luck there either.

Any ideas? I'm in UK if that limits options?",AJackson3,/r/homeautomation/comments/ewwmvx/dimmable_smart_socket/,2,homeautomation,3
ewws3u,1580512257,Motorising roman blinds,"Hi all,
I am looking to automate my 2700x2100mm roman blinds. From the research I‚Äôve done most systems work well with a chain but not so much with several cords. I need a smart pulley of some kind. The best I can come up with is a $150 small trailer winch that can be controlled by a remote control, but the control isn‚Äôt smart and i‚Äôd need to build a unit that pushes the buttons. My other concern is that it‚Äôll be loud and id need to install it outside which is annoying but doable. I feel i am over thinking this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",rodgebottle,/r/homeautomation/comments/ewws3u/motorising_roman_blinds/,5,homeautomation,0
ewwxbt,1580512864,Smart Bulbs with recessed lighting?,"
Has anyone done this? I live in an apartment and the lights in the bedroom are LED recessed lighting, so there isn't actually a bulb to unscrew. Here's what I'm talking about:
