dpwezv,1572566636,"What would you recommend for remote controlled window closing? Ex: keep window open in the evening to cool the bedroom down, start falling asleep in bed, and then close window with remote instead of getting up and maybe losing your sleepiness","This happens to me alot in the summer. Even with a fan and AC, its too warm. At night, I open the window, which unfortunately based on its position, I cannot just have the bed next to the window.

It cools down after I open the window, and I get close to falling asleep. If I don't close the window though, car and street sounds will make me up at like 4 AM so I get up and close the window. But the act of getting up and closing the window breaks that sleepy feeling I had and it takes me much longer to fall asleep than if I could have just closed that window from bed with a remote.

dpz215,1572580075,Slimline panel for a desk (Scene Controller?),"I have a height adjustable desk with the little height control panel mounted under the desk on the edge and to the side, like [this](https://www.upliftdesk.com/advanced-keypad-by-uplift-desk/) (not the exact desk/control I have).

I'd like to be able to mount something similar next to the height adjustment pad to control 2-4 programmed functions in the same room. I *think* this is called a scene controller, but I'm not 100%.

I'd like it to be USB powered, but if not I'd take 120v if I could keep the same form factor/design. If this doesn't exist, I'd just wire a sealed box w/ a normal 120v 4-button Z-wave switch and mount it somewhere creative.

The searching I've done has not turned up much, I've found wall styled switches I *could* put in a sealed box and mount, I've found a ton of home automation things in absurd shapes and sizes.

Am I missing something or going about this wrong? Anyone have good examples of controlling a couple things from their desk? I'd prefer not to add wires and clunky things to the top of my desk. I could use my phone to do all of this, but kind of like physical buttons for the things I want to do.

My setup is a HomeSeer HomeTroller with the Z-Wave stick, rest of house is Z-Wave HomeSeer wall switches, some arbitrary Z-Wave smart plugs.

What I am looking to do is say ""Hey google, start the jeep"". Thus, google will start my jeep that is sitting in the driveway.

I am wondering if this is possible through programming or such? Also, the remote runs off a 1.5 V battery I believe, which means I would need to reduce relay voltage output significantly.

Any suggestions would be so greatly appreciated!

A smart plug might not be at the top of your list of additions to modernize your home, but this unassuming piece of smart technology has the capacity to revolutionize your daily life by automating your dumb devices while optimizing your energy consumption.

&amp;#x200B;

[Smart Plugs like this one are a great alternative to installing a smart outlet. ](https://preview.redd.it/i2dj60q4w3w31.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f59b17685b400b25e5018dd7cb0f4fb064eb6e9)

 Using a smart plug is a key way to make your home “smarter” in that it allows you to connect, control and monitor multiple devices simultaneously from a remote wireless connection. This provides a seamless nexus from which to manage your device usage and monitor daily energy consumption. Additionally, certain smart plugs offer more advanced features, such as an “away mode” to automate your lighting and device usage to simulate your routine behavior when you’re away from home.

&amp;#x200B;

[Check out the latest line of smart plugs and other smart home tech at microzu.com ](https://preview.redd.it/ixglg7srx3w31.jpg?width=470&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d885271a7704655d6b31011511891b13abb8b7e3)

 One of the primary benefits of upgrading to a smart plug is the ability to connect, automate and manage your “dumb” devices without having to deal with the rewiring necessary to install a smart outlet. Your chosen smart plug will likely come with a companion application, through which you’ll be able to set preferences, schedule tasks and manage the devices connected to the plug. You’ll also be able to connect the user account you created on the companion app with your preexisting Google Home or Amazon Alexa accounts to enable voice command recognition and other features.",Denver290,/r/smarthome/comments/dq786i/the_smart_plug_bringing_seamless_connectivity_to/,0,smarthome,0
dq7fxo,1572629392,New Home came with Vista 20p? Use that or get something else?,"I'm new to alarm systems so not really sure where to begin or which direction to take so I appreciate your feedback.

I recently bought a new home that came with a preinstalled alarm system. I believe its a Vista 20p please correct me if I'm wrong. The house already has sensors on the doors, windows and garage as well as the siren wired upstairs. What are my options to take advantage of the system? 


Hardware:

- 3x door sensors

- 2x window sensors

- Garage door sensor

- Honeywell 6150RF keypad



I have considered the EnvisaLink4 but I don't have Ethernet to the panel - can I connect the envisalink to a ethernet-to-wifi adapter?

I also have wiring for a 2nd keypad upstairs. I've read that I actually need a 6160 to program the system so I'm thinking I need to buy a 6160 to put downstairs  and relocate the 6150 upstairs? 

Ideally, I want to be able to arm/disarm from both upstairs/downstairs as well as via keychain remotes. I also want to add a glass break sensor and remote monitoring which is a requirement for my GF. So currently it looks like I would need buy the following additional items:

- EnvisaLink 4

- 6160 keypad

- 2x keychain remotes

- glass break sensor

- remote monitoring


Do I have the right approach in order to take advantage of the system or should I consider getting something more user friendly to install such as SimpliSafe/Nest/Ring etc.?

2x Echo Dot (2nd Gen)
2x Echo Dot (3rd Gen) (for £0.99p each!!)
1x Firestick TV
1x ChromeCast (2nd Gen)
Pixel 4 XL (Me)
Pixel 3a (GF)
All plugs, bulbs and switches are within the SmartLife eco-systen.

I really want to get a Nest Doorbell + Google Home Max but they're so much more expensive than Ring Pro + EchoShow and if I did shift I'd need two more Nest Minis to replace the Echo Dots. 

My biggest issue is that I prefer Google Assistant (which I think is leading the way) over Alexa, each have their strengths but continued conversation + freetyoe routines gives Google the edge for me. However I have 4 Echos at the moment and to shift to Nest I'm looking at £300 for the assistants and £250 for the doorbell. 

Thoughts on a postcard!

There’s already plenty of perfectly good inexpensive self contained options out there on amazon and the hardware store that will only send power through when temps drop below a certain point.

And yet part of me thinks “yeah but what if I got a smart outlet or power strip and set an automation to turn on when the local weather says it’s cold?”

But then I think.. a smart outlet will cost me 2-3 times as much, be dependent on my home WiFi and maybe my internet connection, a smart ecosystem that may change or stop being supported some number of years down the road.  And for what benefit?  So I can see if the palm trees are being warmed on my home dashboard?  So I can see how often they’re on?

Use cases from simple smart lighting to custom Arduino RGB lighting, to feeding and watering chickens.","So my wife and I just bought a house, and I can finally start adding smart fixtures, expensive and permanent setups, etc. I'm very much a planner, so I am debating which ecosystem I should stick to. I am mainly debating between Hubitat as a central controller, or going full mad scientist with hass.io and node red. I am happy to hear other solutions, though. Also while we're on the topic of standards, I'm leaning zigbee over z-wave because I own a bunch of Ikea Tradfri bulbs and plugs, but happy to hear contrasting opinions, or even wi-fi with multiple access points if it's actually better.


Current use: Google Home for voice, a bunch of Ikea Tradfri (zigbee) bulbs, a few smart outlets (wemo and ikea zigbee)


Planned immediate use: door locks, wired light switches (finally), robot vacuum (likely Shark auto empty), 2x ecobee 5th gen or 2x nest for our multiple zones, security system likely on Blue Iris (probably doing Reolink 410s)


Future use: upgrading security system to include dog/baby cams (and necessary noise/motion alerts pinging phone), replacing baseboard heaters' rheostats with a smart relay, arduino controlled RGB LEDs for holiday lighting, water pumps (could be dumb on smart outlets) and temperature sensors for my aquaponics, automatic feeders/probably custom feeders for rabbits and eventual chickens.

I'm an Android user and while keeping things local is fairly important to me, being able to access things remotely via my phone is also important.


So I feel like either would serve me well. I'm leaning Hubitat because it has built in packages for most things I'd be doing to start, which are fairly simple. However for some of the late game advanced stuff I may have to learn node red and MQTT anyway, so I'm not positive it doesn't make sense just to start with it. Seems like a bigger online community too. I'm a fairly tech savvy guy, I've dabbled in real programming, and do SAS and SQL all day. I don't mind taking inordinate amounts of time to get things working, and LOVE the research and setup phase of projects, but don't love to go back and tinker and constantly update to fix things.

My understanding is that z-waves devices needs to be always on (due to it's nature), and therefore needs a neutral wire to close the loop in order to stay connected to the network.

I tried connecting it to the electrical box with switch A. Hot wire (from source) to line, neutral wire (from another switch source) to neutral, two travels to the black and red of the connecting cable to the second switch.

It yielded weird results. If I turn on switch A (now smart) it works, off state also works. If I keep the smart switch on, and toggle switch B, the light doesn't really turn off, it goes into a very dim state. Keeping this connection, if I go back to the smart switch and toggle that, nothing happens.

So maybe I drew the diagram incorrectly or something's not connected correctly somewhere. I've yet to touch anything in switch c and switch b.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.",peanut_throwaway,/r/homeautomation/comments/dqw9gb/4_zwave_way_switch_help/,3,homeautomation,2
dqwk7x,1572760582,"New House: Planning for security, automation, and Amazon Echo","Hi,

I recently bought a house and would like to set it up so that my security system works well with smart home automation and Amazon Echo. 

I am thinking about going with the below setup:

**Doorlock**: Schlage Encode (Works with Ring) - I need something with number pad and that potentially works with Key by Amazon. I am still debating if I should go with Schlage Encode(WiFi) or Schlage Connect (Zigbee)

**Doorbell**: Ring

**Thermostat**: Ecobee

**Wi-Fi**: Eero

**Security System**: Ring 24/7 monitoring

**Smart Floodlights to be setup around the house**: Ring (require Ring bridge)

**Smart Home automation Hub**: Hubitat

**Voice Assistant**: Echo Show (already have this)

\-----

**About me**: I am new to home automation. I am super interested in home automation and plan to ramp up quickly.

**Questions**:

1. Which Smartlock would you recommend? Why?
2. Ring does not integrate with Hubitat (or any smarthome hub that i can think of). So all the sensors that are linked to the security system will not work with other smarthome hubs, other than Amazon Echo. Should I even buy Hubitat/other hubs at all?
3. I feel like my house will be full of too many hubs/extenders. I can count 6 so far - 3 eero, 1 ring security hb, 1 ring bridge for smart-lights, 1 hubitat. is it common to have these many bridges/hubs?
4. What is the most economical way to approach me setting up automation and security.",ph7891,/r/homeautomation/comments/dqwk7x/new_house_planning_for_security_automation_and/,5,homeautomation,1

dr2tyl,1572798887,Relay sensor,"Hi all,

I'm new at this home automation stuff, and looking at taking my first dive.

*Doorbells.*

I want a sensor to trip when my door bell goes off.

I don't want to replace the button on the outside of my house with something plasticy and gimmicky, or with cameras and what not integrated.  I also want to keep my existing sounder working.

My door bell is the hard-wired variety, and I measure 6V over the terminals when inactive and it drops to about 2-3V when the button is pressed.  Edit: I've now found the 8V AC transformer that supplies the bell.

My theory is, I should be able to tap into the feed from the button and wire a sensor relay in line.  When the button is pressed, the sensor is triggered.  I can configure my controller software to send me an instant message or whatever.

That's my theory, and that's pretty much where I'm stuck.  I've never bought any of these sorts of things.  I'm looking at primarily at Zigbee, or Z-wave devices.  Can anybody confirm whether my theory is sound, and if there is such a wireless relay available to buy that would achieve this?

My bell is the exposed type, so I don't think the hack of sticking a door sensor next to it will get close enough to work, without stopping the bell from chiming.

I have a Nest doorbell and it totally borks the range for both of my garage door openers, one a Craftsman which is located approximately 20 feet away and one a Liftmaster which is an additional 20 feet further. I don't know how or why the Nest doorbell is doing this. 

It's especially weird because all the other wi-fi stuff in my house has no effect at all. This includes a Google Home and Chromecast right in the garage, 4 wi-fi light switches that are as close or closer to the garage door antenna than the doorbell is, and a Nest thermostat that's about as close as the doorbell. (plus a bunch of crap upstairs above the garage as well). None of these interfere at all. It's like the doorbell is throwing off something other than wi-fi frequency (I believe my garage door cycles between 315 and 390 MHz).

Anyone have any tips on how to make it not, or do I pretty much have to choose between working garage door remotes or a video doorbell?

EDIT: I'm a moron. I solved it and it's the stupidest thing ever. There is an always-on light illuminating my house number on the front of my garage. I never knew it was on this circuit as I worked on it during the day (easier to function in places where the lights have been disabled). I still flipped every switch and tried every outlet, but this light is just always on, so it escaped my notice entirely. Pulled a bulb to break the circuit, problem solved. They were LEDs.

We've had a suspended ceiling installed with 4 strips (zones) of RGB LED's (4pin). The electrician used a IR kit instead of an RF kit but it's not fit for purpose so I need to replace the controllers with RF ones. To do this I was going to get a DX8 touchpanel on the wall to be able to select each of the 4 zones individually. I have 2 issues I was hoping someone can help with:

1. There seem to be 2 controller types (R4-5A and R4-CC). Which one do I need?
2. The touchpanel doesn't allow colour profiles to be saved. Can this be done with a separate remote, and if so can anyone help me choose one? I assume it needs to be compatible with DMX512 but I'm new to this so I don't know.

drktnz,1572888190,First Hub: Hubitat and/or Smartthings,"Hi!
I'm considering getting a hub and I really need some advice.

Background: I currently have a handful of devices set up. Wyze cams, Blink cams, some Sonoff and Tuya smart switches, a bunch of Tuya bulbs and some LED strips. I also have a Qnap and a couple of RPis which I've added in but don't use for anything just yet. Till now my main mode of control has been through Echo devices and I also have some fairly elementary automations running through the dedicated apps/IFTTT. Nothing too complicated just yet, just some time based events. Oh, and I live in India, in case that's pertinent.

Plan: Looking to expand my smart home by adding more lighting and power outlets along with smart sensors and the like and to use those to add more complicated automations. I also plan on reducing my reliance on internet based control (though I don't want to eliminate it) and to get some local control going (primarily to allow automations to run even without Internet access). I've had some issues with Internet outages and even some power outages and while I can't do much about the latter, going local to would certainly help with the former. The added privacy benefits are also nice though not the main driving factor.

Query: Now that that's out of the way, I'd like some advice on how to go about my plan. While I initially avoided hubs because of the added cost and the admittedly flawed assumption that a hub would automatically restrict my options compared to wifi based devices, I have, through hours of home automation content on YouTube etc, grown to appreciate local control and centralised hub based automation. I had initially narrowed it down to Smartthings, Hubitat and Home Assistant but ended up eliminating the last option due to the lack of free Alexa based control (I share my home with my parents and it took a lot of effort to get them acquainted with Alexa and I don't think either of them would go along with HA if it meant losing functionality or a recurring charge). So, now I'm down to Hubitat and Smartthings and was wondering which one I ought to go with or if I ought to buy both. I've gone through various videos, articles and Reddit posts related to this but, to be honest, I'm just a lot more confused than I was when I began. I'd really appreciate any advice you can offer.

drmoba,1572895670,Cloud hosted data logging (InfluxDB etc.),"Looking for any advice on cloud-hosted data logging for my semi-smart home sensor system, ideally first-hand experience from people who've done this.

My setup: I have ESP8266 sensors measuring temperature, power consumption, etc., all of which send data via MQTT to a Raspberry Pi in my closet. From there, I have a Node-RED flow that sends selected ""streams"" of data to Thingspeak, which I can then access (in a limited way) from outside the house.

In the past, I've also used InfluxDB on the RPi to store data (also sent via Node-RED flow), and used Chronograf to visualize it. 

Issues:

1. Thingspeak is great for what it is, but the data visualization is a bit clumsy, and you can only log eight different channels.
2. InfluxDB on the RPi was nice, but killed my SD card after a while (all that data writing is hard on the SD card) AND I can't get at the data from outside without exposing my RPi to the world. 

My ideal solution would be InfluxDB and Chronograf or something similar, *in the cloud* so I can see it from wherever, and not worry about trashing my SD card. The InfluxDB folks offer this as a service, but it is really expensive.

Amazon Web Services looks like it might be an option, but it is very confusing to figure out where to start (I only understand the basics of cloud, I'm not a developer) and I worry about costs.

drn4ta,1572897493,Which smart blinds do you guys recommend?,"Hey everyone,

After a year of living with paper blinds, I have finally saved enough money to do a nice upgrade for my window coverings.

The wife and I previously lived in a condo with motorized smart blinds and we absolutely fell in love with them.

I have been doing my research and I would like people's opinion on the different things on the market:

[Dooya Motors:](http://dooya.com/product_index_en.php?nid=36)

This was my first experience with motorized blinds. These made-in-China motors performed as expected. They were capable of lifting the condo's 12' alternated zebra blinds (which totals 24' of fabric). However, the battery was discharging at an incredible rate (even when I wasn't using them at all) I had to charge them every 2-3 weeks at one point and they were not able to sustain their charge even with upgraded solar panels. The supplier of the motors and the installer of the blinds ran many simulations and tests to identify the reason behind why they were discharging so fast (static electricity, not enough sunlight, etc.) but they could never pinpoint the exact reason.

These are mono-directional communication motors via a RF of 433mHz. This means that a remote sends a signal (up, down or pause) to the motors and they respond as such. The motors were incapable of communicating back to report the location of the blinds. I managed to ""smartify"" these blinds by connecting a RF blaster that copies the remote's signals to my phone, but it's functionality was limiting.

To explain it briefly, my setup was basically Phone &gt; Raspberry Pi &gt; RF blaster &gt; Blinds. However, the blinds were not able to communicate back to the blaster to report the location of the blinds. To work around this, the Pi would remember the last position that was set and assume the blinds were at that position. However, everything would break if someone controlled the blinds ""manually"" via the remote (since the remote does not go through the Pi).

[Somfy Motors:](https://www.somfy.com/portail/index.cfm)

After a year of living with the Dooyas, my installer decided to upgrade all the motors to Somfy motors as their supplier had noticed the shortcomings of the Dooya motors. These were much more powerful and a lot more quiet. I didn't have time to thoroughly test them out as I moved shortly after the motors were changed.

From my research, Somfy recently announced Zigbee 3.0 blinds with bi-directional communication (meaning the blinds can report their location to a hub). However, these do not seem to be readily available just yet. Somfy also has motors that run on their own proprietary Somfy Digital Network (SDN) which is a bi-directional protocol. However, motors that are SDN-ready do not seem to be wire free.

Somfy has 433mHz motors like the Dooyas, but they are limited in the sense that they are mono-directional. There are addons to turn them into bi-rectional, but you would need an add-on that needs to be plugged into the wall.

Somfy also has two hubs: the TaHoma and the myLink. Based on the information I could find online, they work pretty much like my Pi + RF blaster setup.

As a side note, the 433mHz wavelength is capable of bi-directional communication, but the hardware inside the Dooya/Somfy motors do not seem to be capable of such. This leads to my next finding.

[Rollease Acmeda:](https://www.rolleaseacmeda.com/us)

One of my friends recently got these installed throughout their home. Supplied by BlindsToGo/MarcheDuStore, they got them installed at a very good price during one of their promotions at about 500-600$/blind.

From what I gathered, Rollease Acmeda makes and uses their own motors that run on their proprietary Automate Radio Communication (ARC) protocol on a 433mHz wavelength. They recently announced a second generation hub that would support the big three Homekit, Alexa and Google. According to their website, their motors are capable of 500 uses per charge and their built-in Li-Ion batteries have a 500 charge cycle lifespan.

Other than that, I have no much other comments on these as I couldn't find much information on the internet about them and my friend didn't have them long enough to have a strong opinion.

[Lutron Serena:](http://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/ShadingSystems/SerenaShades/Overview.aspx)

Regarded as the top of the top in terms of motorized blinds, these will run you into poverty. Their blinds run off of store-bought D-Cell Alkaline batteries and have (allegedly) a minimum 1-year battery life. The motors are proprietary to Lutron and use their own Clear Connect bi-directional communication protocol.

With their hub, the blinds are big three ready. Other than the little reasearch I did, I didn't check much because I'm way too poor to afford these everywhere.

As a side note, I do have Lutron switches throughout my house and they are absolutely amazing.

[Hunter Douglas PowerView:](https://www.hunterdouglas.ca/operating-systems/motorized/powerview-motorization)

Hunter Douglas have a long history with their blinds and are regarded as a premium quality blind. My in-laws have Hunter Douglas and I must say their build quality exceeds the other brands out there. 

Does this mean they are WORTH the premium? I wouldn't be able to say based on my n=1 anecdotal experience. My folks have a lesser known non-premium brand of manual shades at home and they perform just the same way as the Hunter Douglas' at my in-laws (although build quality differences are noticeable in the casings, cord, etc). 

As for my findings, the PowerView also operates on their own proprietary bi-directional RF protocol. Communicating with their second generation hub, they are compatible with the big three. Running off of AA or C batteries, their company boasts a 1 year battery life with ""standard"" use.

I must say I am a big fan of the use of external batteries (as a personal preference) because with my experience with the Dooya motors, it's such a hassle to have to plug-in your blinds to charge your motors; pulling an extension cord and then leaving the cord up for however long it takes to charge the motor... and no being able to do everything at once because I don't have enough extension cords or the motors don't all run out of power the same time...

Mind you, my experience was exceptionally bad since my blinds were 12', meaning I had to climb a ladder everytime.

[Ikea FYRTUR/KADRILJ:](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/fyrtur-blackout-roller-blind-wireless-battery-operated-gray-50408186/)

The Ikea smart blinds made a huge splash when they were announced (and when they were eventually released) because of their affordability and quality. Sporting the grand choice of a single blackout style in North America, the FYRTUR comes in preset sizes maxing out at 48"" in width .

Running off of the Zigbee protocol and being able to be paired to your own hub or their wonky and unreliable TRADFRI hub, the FYRTUR has bi-drectional communication and a removeable li-ion battery pack. Ikea claims that 1 charge can last at least 4 months, but with their removeable battery slots, it would be a lot less hassle to charge compared to plug-in blinds.

I currently have 1 set of blinds for the master bedroom at my home and they work very well. They are quieter than the Dooyas that I had and are extremely responsive with Siri (I paired mine to my own Zigbee hub and bridged it to Siri with Homebridge).

However, without a valance/fascia, they are not something I would want in a non bedroom setting. You can probably easily make one yourself with some fabric and velcro (for easy access to the battery slot), but it is one of the shortcomings of the blinds.

The other shortcoming is the non customizable widths. I shortened one from 48"" to 45"" to inside mount them and it was very easy to do. I would have chosen Ikea blinds for all the bedrooms if I didn't have a 50"" window in one of the bedrooms...

[Levolor:](https://www.levolor.ca/)

I found these blinds when browsing for budget motorized blinds online. They don't seem to be ""smart"" ready with any of the big three and might run off of [Bluetooth(?)](https://www.levolor.com/life-hack-motorization-for-window-coverings/). There's not much information that I could find online, but if it's really running off of bluetooth, I am personally not interested in it because it doesn't seem likely to be able to have them Homekit compatible.

[Bali:](https://www.baliblinds.com/)

Same thing as above, found them online and they also seem to run off Bluetooth(?). If anyone has any information on these two brands, I would gladly appreciate your input.",m3m3a,/r/homeautomation/comments/drn4ta/which_smart_blinds_do_you_guys_recommend/,28,homeautomation,38

droxef,1572904572,"Owners of battery WiFi outdoor camera systems (Arlo, Ring, Nest, Blink etc) - are they worth it?","After researching battery/solar operated WiFi outdoor cams for a while, I thought I’d settled on the Blink XT2 due to the no subscription cost and being able to set fairly specific alert areas.

However after looking at reviews, it seems an inherent fault of all battery WiFi cams is that they have a 1-3 second delay upon waking up due to motion, so will potentially miss the activity entirely.

Seeing the cost of the Arlo Pro 2 system, or the subscription fees of Ring/Nest, it seems strange that there aren’t more complaints about them missing activity, and none of the major reviews really cite that as a negative (which it kind of is as that is the entire point of battery-only cams as they can’t do 24/7 recording).

My question to any owners of these systems - is this a noticeable issue? Is it very dependent on WiFi signal strength/speed or do all (battery) cams exhibit this behaviour?

EDIT: after reading all of the replies, I still don't know what to go for! It seems Blink and Arlo are the most popular, but there are fairly equal amounts of people saying do/don't get them for various reasons.

I have looked into Reolink, but there reviews all have the same issues that Blink etc do - delay when recording, issues with the app etc.",blazin2323,/r/homeautomation/comments/droxef/owners_of_battery_wifi_outdoor_camera_systems/,52,homeautomation,66

drq5on,1572909662,Guide To LED Light Strips,"LED strip lights are one of those things where there are a ton of different and varying qualities, outputs, and lifespans. I have done a lot of research and have favorites. The question for you is really, what is the intended use and lifespan you are looking for vs budget.

If you are looking for something that will last 10-15 years, have amazing color rendering, use the best LEDs with the best phosphors, 3-4oz copper strip for heat dissipation, and a really bright output, you probably want to avoid aliexpress and *most* amazon sellers. I am sure there are great ones on amazon. I couldnt find it. Also here in this page I have seen people link to amazon with referral links. Check the link before you take someones advice.

5050s are the older LED type and pretty inefficient compared to the new LEDs out there. If you are looking for color changing RGB, yeah the 5050s are good. But if you are looking for cove lighting with a nice warm white... I would recommend 3014, 2835, 2216, and 2110 LEDs (in high density).

You're probably going to need something 300-500 lumen per foot + on a dimmer if you need some good output.

I recommend going with a 24V light, as you can make longer runs without doltage drop or uses of amplifiers.

Amazon is a crapshoot. I have had great results for small behind the TV projects but when purchased again from same seller, the product changed and was junk. Others I got from amazon got too hot. I think they are overdriving the LEDs to achieve brightness.

[Option 1 - Zephyr Lumen](https://zephyrshop.co) \- Great super-bright product. I ordered years ago and the lights are still extremely bright, run cool, and they had a design service for free where I took my photos of my project and they built it all out and quoted it. Prices are reasonable compared to everything else on the market. I loved it. 

[Option 2 - Elemental LEDs](https://www.elementalled.com/) I also tried these guys but I cannot find where you can buy online anymore. They had a good selection of dimmers and remotes and I used their lower output lights on my kickboards. They are still running well!

[Option 3 - Environmental Lights](https://www.environmentallights.com/) \- Great for DMX and controlls. I havent tried their lights honestly but the specs look good.",lovintheweatherr,/r/homeautomation/comments/drq5on/guide_to_led_light_strips/,40,homeautomation,18

drxovl,1572952083,Need advice on robot vacuum,"Hi!

I currently have a used Roomba 580 that i bought just to kind of test the concept of robot vacuums. And it works alright.

There's a couple of things that bug me though, and i was hoping you could suggest other models that don't have these issues, or fixes for the issues:

- The charging dock is unbelievably flimsy and lightweight, and the roomba will push it around, rendering it unable to find its way home.

- I have a noticable doorstep in the middle of my apartment that my roomba will get stuck on 50% of the time. It works reasonably well if the robot comes head-on, but it gets stuck if it comes on from the side.

- I'm not always the best at removing clothes/cables/whatever from the floor, so my roomba will swallow cables and socks :(

- The roomba can go under all my furniture, except one piece where it occasionally gets stuck.


What are your budget suggestions for these terms? I've heard good about the Xiaomi S50 for general effectiveness and the fact that it has mapping (which would solve point 4 and possibly point 1) But i don't know if theres any models on the market that will notice doorsteps and make sure to go over them head on, and notice obstacles such as loose socks and cables and go around them.

* Install LED strip lighting along bookshelves and a hallway (maybe the staircase too)
* Install smart cameras

I thought I had a sense of where to go, but the deeper I get into RF, channels etc. the less I seem to know. I'm wondering if y'all can help me with the following:

* Should I go with Z-Wave, Zigbee, or WiFi? Do WiFi devices burden the network as much as people make it seem?
* If I go with Z-Wave, are there good light strip options that allow color management? It seems like I'd need to use this (https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=36511) to manage the color display, is that right? 
* As an alternative on #2, it sounds like I could also use Philips Hue, but does that conflict (since it uses Zigbee and I'd be using Z wave elsewhere)?
* Is it a bad idea to start out with the SmartThings hub if I'm building a Z-wave system? 
* Depending on #1, what's everyone's favorite smart light switches?
* Finally, thinking of going the Nest Camera route. Anybody have a bad experience there?

I am fine with using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave. I just don't even know how to search for what I'm seeking at this point. 

Ultimately I want to control the lock instead of using the manufacturer's software/mobile apps -- are there any locks that do this?

What would be much more useful to me, is if I could get the same alert and video feed access in a web browser on my PC. 

It appears that Cocoon don't provide that software, but is there any open-source IP camera type software which would allow this functionality? Otherwise, I might return this one and get a Ring 2 Doorbell so I can use the Windows software.

dsda5r,1573027618,"New Home with unique detached garage - multiple lock types, new security system","I'm moving from an apartment to a home with a sort of attached garage - the garage and house share a wall (can get strong wifi) but have separate exterior doors.  Using the overhead garage door is less practical than using the regular door that's right by the front door (it's covered vs walking in ice/snow and around to the side of the garage).  I don't want to have to lock and unlock 2 doors each time I go in and out, especially since my favorite smart feature in my apartment is my August Pro + Connect lock with the auto unlock feature.  I also want to add a smart security system with easy arm/disarm features.

Current setup/equipment:  
\- August Pro + connect with auto lock and auto unlock  
\- Google Home Mini  
\- Google Chromecast  
\- Several Wemo plugs, some using timers and some using Google Home/Assistant voice commands

I have a strong preference for Nest/Google ecosystem (discount via work), but not at a sacrifice of functionality (ie, I would rather keep auto unlock then switch to the Yale x Nest lock and lose that functionality.

Wants:

1. Smart security system - I live alone except for my cat, so want door/window sensors and an alarm for at night and when I'm away, but sensitivity adjustment that won't have my cat trigger it.  I travel for work, so short-commitment professional monitoring is a plus.  Ease of arming (ie, timer when I leave by location or trigger by something like door lock or garage door) and disarming (ideally auto unlock and disarm like my August lock does).  
2. Smart locks - I have 3 doors, one back door (light use, will probably get a keyless lock with a code for this later), and then the front and garage doors, which I would want to work closely together, either unlocking one from the inside unlocks the other (so when leaving house, unlocking house from inside auto unlocks the garage entry and vice versa), or possibly 2 separate routines.  For instance, say ""Hey Google, I'm leaving"" will unlock the garage door (then I will manually unlock a smartlock from the inside, which will be timed to auto-lock later).  To return home, I like my existing August auto-unlock, but if another lock could be triggered to unlock by something like a smart overhead garage opener (or unlocking the garage door smart lock).

Future planned add ons:  
\- Nest thermostat  
\- Nest protect  
\- Nest hello doorbell  
\- camera(s) for garage interior/exterior   
\- Smart garage door opener (primarily to verify open/close remotely, but would also like if it could link to other leave/arrive actions)  
\- Automated shades/blinds   
\- Probable lighting upgrades (existing Wemo plugs do this well enough for now)

In my perfect world, the Nest x Yale lock would have Connected by August or auto-unlock functionality and could therefore auto-unlock and disarm as I arrive home, but that doesn't work.  

I haven't found many reviews for mixing smart lock types.  I wonder if the following would work:  
1. Existing August Pro \[or Yale Assure Connected by August\]: gives key \[+ keypad\] + auto-unlock options for the main front door into the house  
2. Nest x Yale lock on garage entry door (would unlocking this from inside the garage be able to disarm a Nest Secure?  Though possibly it still cannot unlock automatically when I leave and I would still have to unlock with a code when I leave the house and get into the garage)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a non-Nest option that I am possibly overlooking?  Several other threads have mentioned Abode having geo auto arm/disarm features and more IFTTT and integration capabilities.  Also, if there is a hub that might reduce my multi app use, I'd appreciate suggestions as I'm pretty unfamiliar with them.  Though, I currently only use them to set routines and forget them, so once I figure out the automation that works for me, I can forget about the app.",cassielu318,/r/smarthome/comments/dsda5r/new_home_with_unique_detached_garage_multiple/,2,smarthome,2

Problem is, they also seem to have taken every hub and device that wasn't screwed in, except a Ring Chime. So, I seem to have the following:

* Lutron wireless lights (probably Caseta?) all over the house.
* Kuna video security light at the backdoor
* Philips Hue light strip
* Elgato Eve door alert fobs
* Ecobee3 thermostat

I was able to get the apps and set up the Ring doorbell &amp; Chime, and Ecobee. I haven't tried setting up the Kuna yet.

They haven't been terribly forthcoming with information about how they had the system set up. So far I know they were using HomeKit, had a Hue bridge, and must have had a Lutron bridge.

I'm trying to bring this all together under one system, if possible. So far, my research is telling me the only system that covers all these products is HomeKit, with the Eve triggers being the one product that doesn't claim to work with anything else.

I'd like to make use of everything under one (voice-controllable) product, if possible.

I'm not afraid of some light programming and DIY, so an arduino solution would also be an option, as long as I can control everything with something like a Google or Amazon device for voice commands.

https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/dk7hiq/came_home_yesterday_to_find_someone_tried/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Let me first off say that the feedback I received was overwhelmingly helpful! I just want to thank you all on that. I googled / YouTubed them every product. 

I ended up following u/chipIV and others recommendation to use the Wyze cams. I bought 2 with 32gb micro SD memory cards. Which cost me roughly $70. My biggest concern with this camera was that for the time being they are indoor only cameras. So what I did was I stuck them up against my windows. During the day time I found no issues, however at night came the problems. The lights from the flash created a glare that made it impossible to understand what was recording, so I had to turn that off. Which meant in order for the camera to record anything meaningful at night, I needed flood lights outdoors. That’s where my second product came in. As seen on TV, the Over Lite. https://www.homedepot.com/p/Over-Lite-Overhead-Motion-Activated-LED-Night-Light-OVL-QP54/305363562 

This was shown to me from my home depot rep. He stated that even though the box says the light turns on from motion up to 10’ away, it’s actually 15’. I bought 2 of these for $26 and it solved the glare issue. It’s installed with command strips and takes 3aa batteries. I bought a 48 pack of batteries for $14. 

The only other issue I had with the Camera was that I needed a way to keep it mounted on the window. If I had just left it on the window sill, it wouldn’t view anything. That’s where I bought a pair of 3M shelves for $18. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B06ZYH411W?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title

The camera wasn’t the only smart electronics I bought. I bought an Echo Dot for $35 on eBay. Then I bought a second when it went on sale for under $10 on amazon. The idea came from u/petemayhem and I liked the concept of not paying for a service to call the cops if a window breaks, I can do it myself if I’m properly notified. I also liked the idea of adding smart lights to my home and having them turn on and off throughout the day making it seem like I’m at home. For those I bought 8 Phillip hues light bulbs for just under $80 at Home Depot. 

All in all I spent a little over $250 after taxes and I’m really happy with how my house now functions. If a second update occurs, well then I was probably broken into. 

TLDR: I bought the Wyze camera.",Mick-a-wish,/r/smarthome/comments/dsnxst/update_came_home_yesterday_to_find_someone_tried/,36,smarthome,21

dt1nc4,1573150401,Smart thermostat question,"I don't mean to start another Nest vs Ecobee post, I needed some advise to make the best decision.

I have one of those old White Rodgers mercury thermostats and was looking to get a smart thermostat, the main reason was to really save energy and use some of the convenience features (home/away modes, sensors etc). I haven't looked into home automation and honestly I don't know if I'm into that.

I have a regular natural gas thermostat and enough wires to either connect an Ecobee PEK or dig up an additional wire to use as a cwire (have 2 lust looped around) so connections is not an issue, obviously with Nest it will just work with existing wires. 

Some features I will look to use: geofencing (turning to away mode to save energy), the sensors (I live in a 3 storey townhouse, the rooms are on the 3rd level, living/kitchen on second and garage and small den on lower level), so I'll likely at least put sensors in the bedrooms or at least in the hallway so the thermostat can take an average temp to better turn on/off heat), it's a bummer than nest doesn't have motion detection in it's sensors which could be useful in the future. I am aware that Google recently killed the works with nest API so integration is done for now, but I came across a video recently that mentioned Google trying to develop new integration methods, it's obviously not coming anytime soon but in the future it may happen - [https://youtu.be/QHnd3L7UZpU](https://youtu.be/QHnd3L7UZpU) I'm not a google fanboy or anything nor do I have an Amazon Echo or Google Home device, but I may get one in the future (likely Google mini or something) and with both my wife and I using Android devices, Google is the echo system we really use, that doesn't mean I'm dissing Ecobee, in fact before this post I was all set to buy an Ecobee, but I'm confused again if I should overlook Nest.

With that being said, is there really an advantage to get Ecobee over the Nest in my case? My main purpose is to see saving in my energy bills.

That, and the lousy 5% discount they offered to buy a new system have made me want to take my money elsewhere.

I pay $25 a month for the monitoring service, which I question the benefit of but it takes that level plan to allow me to monitor my house from my phone which is critical.  However, I just looked at the Ring system for kicks and noticed their full monitoring plan is only $10 a month.  On top of that I assume I could cancel the $3/month I already spend for the doorbell.  At that rate I could essentially pay for getting the hardware in a year or two and switch to a system that allows integration with my home system.  Not to mention I'm already fairly well invested in Amazon products. So:

Has anybody tried both and comment between the two?  If not, any complaints from Ring users, especially with home integration?  I'm using SmartThings, expect to add Webcore soon, lots of Echos, 3 Ecobees, z-wave sensors and switches, etc.

I just moved from an old home in Chicago to a newish building in Portland.

The kind of funny irony is that I had much more freedom to automate in my 1920s home in Chicago than in my building that's less than 5 years old!

**My previous set up:**

Climate: Nest E connected to Rheem Furnace, no AC.

Lights: Hue bulbs in all fixtures + bridge.

Automation: Google Home devices + wifi.

TV: TCL Roku TV

&amp;#x200B;

**My full device list:**

* Google Automation Items
   * Google WiFi
   * Google Home Hub (Bedroom)
   * Google Home Mini x2 (Bathroom, Main Room)
   * Nest E (Entryway)
   * iPhone (Home, Wifi, Assitant, etc.)
* Philips Hue Lighting
   * 8 3rd Gen A19 Bulbs
   * Gen 2 Bridge
* Entertainment:
   * Sonos Beam Soundbar (New)
   * TCL Roku TV

&amp;#x200B;

**My current apartment has**:

* Hallway: 2 toggle switches that control 2 sets of 2 circular recessed incandescent luminaire mounts each (this: [outside](https://imgur.com/JWthT1n) | [inside](https://imgur.com/blAnJdH) | [switches](https://imgur.com/BGcmtY1))
* 1 toggle switch &amp; 1 push button(?) switch controlling an overhead fluorescent tube light (switch) and an overhead shared dome/fan enclosure ([tube](https://imgur.com/G9QoerT) | [fan/light](https://imgur.com/7FyMhXK) | [switches](https://imgur.com/68jJQIC))
* Amana PTAC unit with wireless PTAC thermostat ([PTAC](https://imgur.com/TjDnUza) | [wireless thermostat](https://imgur.com/uadyhPS))
* 2 Floor Lamps using 2 of the 8 A19 Hue bulbs.

&amp;#x200B;

**My goals:**

* Find a way to control my PTAC with my Nest.
   * Can I hardwire like a normal HVAC? Is there some sort of adapter?
* Find a way to control my overhead lights with Google Home.
   * Which of these bulbs has a Hue-compatible smart option? I can't find any.
   * Are there smart switches I can use instead that will match each of these lighting styles?
   * Is there a way to just turn these dumb switches+lights smart? I found the [switchmate](https://www.mysimplysmarthome.com/) but from what I can gather the ""Google Home"" support is kind of a sham - it's supported via Google Assistant as a ""skill"" -- and can't be included in routines.

My ultimate goal is to:

***Fully control lights and climate through Google Home/Assistant routines.***

Each time to fix it, I had to start from scratch - like removing it from SmartThings account, re-adding it and re-adding all devices (switches, outlets, etc) to it as if it was brand new hub.

dtcmyz,1573202643,I made a proof of concept of non-cloud 2-way wifi control of LG SmartThinQ / ThinQ appliances. You can help!,"**NO WARRANTIES, DESTROY YOUR APPLIANCES AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
 
TL;DR: LG ThinQ appliances have an undocumented serial interface. This can be used for local 2-way control, eliminating the ThinQ cloud-only integration.

I'm new to home automation and not really sure which forum has the widest reach so I post it here. It is my hope that this basic start inspires others to collaborate via other more permanent venues, so we can collectively cover the entire set of ThinQ commands and package it nicely in a WiFi ESP8266 or something like that.
 
The unit I am interfacing with here is an LSN120HSV5, but I suspect this work can be applied to any LG ThinQ AC. Some LG ThinQ fridges use the same module as well, so the same approach might work for any major LG appliance with the ThinQ module.
 
Inside the outer shell of the AC there are two interesting ports which are described in the service manual:
CN-REMO: This is a 3-wire connection used for wired control panels. I would have needed to buy the $200 control panel to reverse engineer it, so I ignored this.
CN-LINK: This is a 4-wire connection used for the wifi module. You have to unscrew and open the black box next to the LED display which contains the module.
 
The module is a basic WiFi/MCU all-in-one job. It has FCC ID BWJ-LCW003, internal name TWFB-E301D, and it uses a Qualcomm QCA4010 series SoC. The module contains all the cloud stuff and communicates with the main AC controller over a basic command set. The AC and IR remote work fine without this module installed. The module has CN-LINK plus three other unpopulated connectors. The datasheet says these are some combination of UART, JTAG, and USB. It's all coated in a clear epoxy but there is a lot of potential.
 
CN-LINK pin 1 (red wire, and the pin nearest the 45-cut corner of the PCB) is VCC at 5V, though the datasheet seems to say it runs at both 5V and 12V (?). Then it is (2) UART RX, (3) UART TX, and (4) GND. The connector pitch is smaller than 0.1in/2.54mm. It seems bigger than 2mm but I don't have any on hand to try, maybe it's 2.2mm.
 
CN-LINK is 115200 8N1. An FTDI 5V TTL serial/USB cable worked, I used an XBee for wireless control too. As a proof of concept, I figured out the on/off commands and was able to replay them:
 
    POWER ON: 04 00 00 00 65 02 01 01 08 7d c1 7e 40 7e 80 7f 80 42 36
    RESPONSE: 04 00 00 00 87 02 10 01 00 44 d1
 
    POWER OFF: 04 00 00 00 65 02 01 01 02 7d c0 05 76
    RESPONSE: 04 00 00 00 87 02 10 01 00 44 d1
 
I was also able to querying/change some operating parameters, but I don't understand exactly how the full command set works yet. The format seems to be the same in both directions:
 
* Preamble: 04 00 00 00
* Command/Response data
* Checksum byte: CRC16_CCIT_ZERO, or at least the top byte of it
 
When I sent unrecognized commands it usually ignored them, or beeped a few times if it didn't understand. The ThinQ app got confused at one point, but doing a reset on the AC (turn off AC's circuit breaker, wait 30 seconds, turn on, push power button on AC under vane) fixed it.

dth91y,1573228201,Will Nest or Ecobee Thermostat Work,"Hi all. I finally bought my first house and want to start making some parts of it a smart home, starting with the thermostat. I have attached a picture of the wires of 2 of the old thermostats. Can you please advise if it will work with the Nest E, Nest 3rd Gen or Ecobee Smart Thermostats. And if so, how I would need to connect the wires or what I need to do to make it work. Thanks a lot.

dthliu,1573229625,Looking for a smart doorbell that records wirelessly to a NAS,"Nest, Ring, all these companies license security and footage to you. I already have an alarm system. I'm wondering whether there's a doorbell that hooks up to wifi, records video to a nas and alerts you of movement or when it's been pressed, via phone, email, whatever. Plus a microphone and speaker.

A friend was about to purchase an Accfly doorbell because it was on sale on Amazon. It might be good, it might not. If it's going to be done, let it be done properly. Like I said, there's an alarm, so security doesn't matter as much. I guess the alert feature, and maybe talking over the phone while you're in bed might b the most important feature. 

There's an old wired doorbell that works half the time, because the lever switch is bad. I could dismantle it and run the AC (or DC, not sure) to the new bell. That's ideal, rather than relying on batteries. The dimensions are 5.5x9.75cm box, with 2 vertical screws 7cm apart and bottom screw 1.25cm from the bottom. If I got  a doorbell with those dimensions (especially the screws), I wouldn't have to drill any holes in any walls.",wgolding,/r/homeautomation/comments/dthliu/looking_for_a_smart_doorbell_that_records/,29,homeautomation,13

I also have the SmartThings hub, the Wink hub, and the Hubitat hub to see which I liked the best. I have each hub connected to a few of the dimmer switches - just to mess around with them and see which one I like for features etc. 

Issue is:
If the lights in a room are dimmed to say like 20%, then I turn them off, and then turn them back on with SmartThings - the lights go to 100%. This only happens on the SmartThings hub. The Hubitat and the wink will turn the lights on at whatever dim level was last set. 

Can anyone shed light on this? 
I tried excluding the light dimmer to the SmartThings hub then including back again thinking maybe I had the wrong switch type but still same issue.

dtiiwn,1573233494,HTD For Whole House Audio?,"I recently bought a house that was apparently set up with AudioAccess (circa '97) whole house audio. All of the equipment (amps, controllers, etc. ) is gone. I'm left with speakers set up in 6 zones, a doorbell that does nothing (it was routed to the AudioAccess), and wall plates that are pretty much obsolete.

I don't want to spend thousands....I'm Ok spending up to $1K if the system does what I want. I stumbled across HTD and they have a controller and amp combo for about $800. I can also get a wifi adapter that would allow me to use their android app to control the source, volume etc on a per zone basis. 

This is what I'm  looking at:

This solves all my problems but the doorbell, but I could work around that with a standard transformer/chime mounted at the hub point of the whole house audio.

dtk1ai,1573239847,Looking for advice about combining a 120v smart LED dimming switch with LED dimmable shop lights (tube lights),"Hey all,

 I currently have 2 pair of non dimming LED tube lights that I replaced my old school florescent tube bulbs with about two years ago in my garage. They are in the typical garage/shop housing that still has a ballast. I never bypassed the ballast because the tubes I got from Costco didn't require it.

Fast forward to now...I want to replace those with dimmable LED tubes and a LED smart dimmer switch. Since that isn't the most common set up, I had to do a ton of research and learned that now there are 120 volt dimmers that work with LED dimmable tube lights, but you have to bypass the ballast in the fixture. I read that back in the day there were 0-10volt additional wires that controlled the dimming functions of the earlier generation of these tube lights. As in there was an additional control wire.

So my plan is this. I want to used these bulbs and bypass the ballast:

Since it's a Chinese Amazon smart dimmer switch model it isn't in the recommended switches listed in the Toggled recommendations for model number D416-50321, but should that really matter?

 [https://www.toggled.com/dim.aspx](https://www.toggled.com/dim.aspx) 

I also need to check to make sure I have a neutral wire in the box, since my house was built in 1985. 

I'd love to hear any advice on this setup, or any issues anyone has ran into with dimmers and LED's, specifically these garage/shop style tube bulbs. My goal is to be able to tone down the brightness of the bulbs in the garage as I have a mancave setup with TV's for watching sports and not have to turn them off completely.

I have added a link to a photo of the wiring of the old thermostat.

Will maybe the nest or a different smart Thermostat work but just with less wires and less function. Like only temp change or something?

dtxmy4,1573314717,Whole home AV cabinet layout feedback please.,"Hello,

I posted the same in Homelab but no reply and to be honest this question maybe better suited here.

I have a Control4 system, well I’m installing it all soon as my new Cabinet arrived recently (I currently use a small 12u open frame for just networking and server but that’s going when I move the gear). I don’t need a 42u one but it was on eBay and new (surplus stock and they still have some I think if anyone in the UK is interested?). I could of got away with a 36u cabinet but was more expensive, plus I may go down 4K video matrix at some point. At the moment I will have Kodi with Plex backend at each TV for now hence lack of input sources.

I have planned out my Ethernet (Cat6) and also speaker wire as there is 5 audio zone via ceiling speakers from the centralised Matrix and separate Amplifier (both in cab).

This is what I thought would be a good layout in terms of weight, temperature and cable management:

Cabinet details:

* 19"" Floor-Standing Rack and Cabinet
* 42u
* 800X800mm
* Black back and sides with glass frontage

Proposed layout:

* 1u Fan Module (will see what temps are like before buying)
* 1u UniFi Cloud Key 2+ rack mount
* 1u UniFi Security Gateway Pro
* 1u 24 port patch panel
* 1u UniFi 24 port Switch
* 1u 24 port patch panel
* 1u UniFi 24 port POE Switch (250w)
* 1u Space
* 1u Control4 EA-3 on shelf
* 1u Control4 HC800 rack mount
* 1u shelf for Vero 4K + and Apple TV 4K
* 2u shelf for Xbox One X
* 1u Space
* 5u Shelf for Pioneer LX-503 AVR
* 3u Control4 8-Zone Power Amplifier C4-AMP108
* 3u Control4 Audio Matrix Switch C4-16S2-E-B 25
* 1u space
* 4u Unraid Server 
* 1u Furman M-10LX E Power Conditioner (12A outlets)
* 2u APC SMT1500RMI Smart UPS 

Any layout changes you can see needed? I was thinking of maybe moving the Power Conditioner higher maybe?

du2pmw,1573338046,"[Help] Installed Lutron Caseta dimmer as a 3-way with Pico. Lights turn on, but the switch is unresponsive (no indicator lights or functionality)","So I installed a Caseta dimmer in my dining room. This is my third Caseta dimmer install. The first was single-pole, super straightforward with no issues (besides fitting it into the box, lol). The second was a 4-way in my foyer, a little trickier but still successful. For some reason, this install is stumping me. After reading through some old threads on Lutron's forum, I got the lights to turn on by switching the position of the ""tagged"" wire in the [instructions](https://www.casetawireless.com/Documents/0301710a_Caseta%20Advanced%20Inst.pdf). However, the switch itself is totally unresponsive--no indicator lights, no visibility in the app, nothing. I made sure the tab on the bottom is totally pushed in, all of the basic troubleshooting steps. My fear is that I ruined the switch while messing with wire combinations  and rendered it useless, but I wanted to ask for some input before giving up and buying a replacement!

Some suggestions I've read on Lutron's forum:-pigtail the hot wire connections (not sure how this would change things?)

\-cap the ""tagged"" (hot) wire in the second box (with the pico) separately from the other wires so there is only one hot wire in the bundle. (I might have tried this? Honestly I was at it for hours last night between the foyer and dining room so I don't remember everything I tried lol)

And the only other thing I can think of is that the wires on the switch itself are looking pretty rough from being twisted and untwisted so many times...but I'm hesitant to cut and strip them in case I need to return the switch or something.

[Here is a photo](https://imgur.com/a/mWBWXlX) of the combination that finally allowed the lights to turn on.

1. If the Bosch EasyControl app can be used from a phone to control the heating system over WiFi *even when the internet is off*?
2. Has anyone tried to figure out how the EasyControl works, e.g. by port-scanning or trying to analyse the network connections? e.g. does the smartphone app talk directly to a boiler or to Bosch servers?

In the corridor, the lights are LEDs fixed to the ceiling, and there are three switches from which I can control the light. Opening each of the switches I found they are a simple switch (two cables, line in and line out). Once I substitute one of this switches with a Sonoff Mini, the lights stop working for the other switches, only the one with the Sonoff can turn on and off the corridor light (but only after two presses). I have also observed with a multimeter that the line out cable presents 124V at all time (independently if the switch is open or closed) instead of the expected 0V on every other switch when this is open (here the line voltage is 240V).

Looking around I found that this may be caused by the use of a transistor as a controller of the corridor LED lights and therefore this would explain the 124V seen in the L\_out cable.

While looking into what is even out there, I've come across products like Snips.ai and Jeedom, and I'm trying to figure out what I want, what products suit my needs, and where to begin implementing them.

My main goal is to be (mostly) functional without internet connection. (A great plus is the privacy that comes with not sending all my stuff to a cloud.)

I get that to stream music or video, I'll need internet, and our connection should be strong enough for that. I don't want to have constant error messages when I just want to turn on my lights.

I'm open to moving away from Google assistant, but I've already got several devices and it would be great to integrate what I already have, but it's whatever. I'm also willing to build things if needed. I have a raspberry pi that's been looking for a project.

Can anyone help me know what it is that I should be looking into? Even a general flow chart of devices/services would be super helpful. Will I need a home server/home network? How useful will my Google homes be?

Thank you anyone for your time and information.",cmcrom,/r/homeautomation/comments/duddsg/trying_to_learn_about_home_automation_that_doesnt/,63,homeautomation,64

dulbz5,1573437526,"For anyone in Ontario, Canada looking for a well priced, HomeKit enabled smart thermostat.","At Canadian Tire right now, the Honeywell (Lyric) T5 thermostat is on clearance for $124.95 plus an additional instant rebate at the cash of $45 (Ontario rebate).  Total price is 79.95 plus tax!

I’ve wanted a smart thermostat for awhile now, but hated the price that was associated with them. Plus, with the Google acquisition of Nest products, there is very few options for HomeKit enabled versions. I find the google smart home lineup of devices and their interface for controlling/adding new devices is a total convoluted shit show at times. I have exactly zero interest in going down the Alexa path and since so much of my home is already Apple, I wanted to have easy Siri control and painless integration with the Home app. This Honeywell thermostat is perfect for my needs and given the huge discount, I couldn’t pass it up.

I will state a few key details though:

1) Canadian Tire only has the original T5 unit boxes (Not the T5+ with the special low voltage power adapter) but they have been retro fitted to include a special jumper wire. (More info on this below) 
2) This T5 model is meant for those existing thermostats with a 24V ‘C’ wire, but if you’re somewhat handy, patient and use common sense, the included wire and instructions will guide you through modifying your system to accept this unit if you DO NOT currently have a ‘C’ wire.
3) You will need to remove the access panel on your furnace control and move some wires on the terminals. DO NOT attempt this unless you are confident in your ability to do this and ALWAYS flip the off switch on the furnace and kill the breaker on the electrical panel first. I also have a small electrical tester just to ensure all power is indeed cut off. If you have a handy friend or one that is an electrician or apprentice, maybe you can shoot them some pizza and beer (or even just $50 cash) to perform this 10 minute job for you. With all of the savings on this device you have money to spare ;)
4) The Canadian Tire website, cash register and price tags all say “T5+”, but this is not true, however, by performing the above you will get the same result as is achieved with the T5+.

) I’m sure my message here is not very clear, so hit me up with any questions you may have - especially if you are hesitant about the wiring aspect.",tpickard,/r/smarthome/comments/dulbz5/for_anyone_in_ontario_canada_looking_for_a_well/,0,smarthome,1

dulybz,1573440463,Lutron Caseta vs Homeworks,"I just moved into a new (builders) home a few months ago. While there were many upgrades that we did through the builder, one of the upgrades that they did not offer us was the ability to install any smart light switches as part of a broader home automation solution. I am now looking through my options in terms of how I can better automate the lighting in my home.

At first, I was interested in the Lutron Caséta line, as it provides a very easy and simple way to replace my existing ""dumb"" light switches with new smart switches - I had originally planned to upgrade the switches that control my exterior potlights, such that I could keep them on a timer or assign scenes via HomeKit. But then, after exploring the Ceseta product line, I am thinking of eventually upgrading all of my light switches to this system.

My only concern is that the system uses its own bridge rather than your own wi-fi. I have a Amplifi Gamers Edition mesh network which provides a pretty stable and solid wi-fi connection (up to 20,000 sq ft) which I would rather use, but instead Ceseta forces you to use their bridge, which only provides a connection up to 30m. My home is 4400 sq ft, so I'm not sure if 30m range will be good enough if I store my router at the far back end of my home and have to control light switches at the front of the home for potlights.

Then going on the Lutron website, I started to learn more about their other types of products, including RA2Select, RadioRA2 &amp; HomeWorks QS - I am wondering if I should go with HomeWorks instead? I understand that HomeWorks is much more advanced system, but perhaps it may be able to provide me with better range and capabilities, especially if my plan is to eventually upgrade my entire home to these smart switches. I think it will be especially important to select the right system as I don't want to have to switch over later on, and nor do I want to have a mismash of different home automation solutions. At the same time, I do want to be able to install these switches on my own (ideally) - I understand you can do this with Ceseta, but not sure if it can be done with HomeWorks. I also want to ensure compatibility with HomeKit.

But I'm a little new to the smart home stuff.  I used to have a home theater with some smart lighting in it, but things have changed somewhat since ten years ago!

For the life of me, finding a smart home style LED controller/companion app that meets my needs has proven to be more difficult than I thought it would be. And I also need to think about my wife controlling it, and she has different wants.

Here are the main requirements:

• RGBW LED tape (I have this already), so four channels of control.

• Multiple ""zone"" control.  Will likely be two zones, so probably two controllers.

• Prefer the ability to dial in any color, using a separate slider or something for each of the four colors.  Most of the apps I have found seem to just scroll along the fully saturated RGB mixes.  Maybe I want pale blue.  Must be able to have the white LEDs controlled separately from the RGB LEDs.

• Must be able to store some presets containing all the zones.

• Ideal control is over iOS app.  Preferably bluetooth, but could use wifi.  Wouldn't be opposed to some sort of home control hub.

• Should be simple to open the app, choose the light, and change color/brightness.  No fumbling around through a myriad of pages.  

All the above seems like something so basic and simple, but I'm having trouble finding an app that meets these needs.  Lastly...

• Wife really wants the ability to use our Alexa Dot to say something like ""Alexa, turn on the top cabinet lights"" or activate a preset.

Anyone got any leads here?  Here are some things I have looked at:

duuaax,1573487795,Google Ecosystem Woes (G-Suite w/SmartThings &amp; Home),"Hiya Reddit,

I've been wrestling with this problem for the last year or two and keep hoping that a software update will magically solve it for me, but aggravation has got high enough that I wanted to ask your advice.

Our setup:

\- Samsung SmartThings hub, three rooms with smart bulbs configured to various 'scenes' that set brightness

\- Google Home Hub (1st gen) with 3 Google Minis

\- Nest thermostats

\- MyQ garage door control

\- Amazon Key on the front door (doesn't work with Google things, which is fine)

\- Konnected alarm setup through SmartThings

All of these work just fine when using their native apps, but Google Home can't consistently trigger SmartThings 'scenes' when they're configured through Home Routines. For example, if we set up a scene in SmartThings with low lighting, and then set up a Home Routine to trigger it, it will work maybe 2 out of 3 times. The rest of the time, one of the Minis will just play a piano 'thonk' sound and do nothing, or else it will complain that there's a problem and I should set that routine up again.

We could just set the Home routines to control the lights directly, but the trouble with this is that the Minis like to acknowledge requests like that with OKAY, DIMMING SIX LIGHTS, which at nighttime or in a nursery with a sleeping baby is just as desirable as you'd imagine.

The biggest culprit here is that my 'regular' Google account is an old G-Suite account and so it isn't supported by Google Home. I had to get a regular Gmail account to use Google Fi anyway, so I just set everything up under that, so my phone has both accounts. I suspect that part of the problem is that, when any of the Google devices hear a voice command, Google Assistant gets perplexed about whether it's coming in under my G-Suite account (which Home doesn't know about) or my Gmail account (which it does) ... except that my wife, who just has a regular Gmail account, has the same problem.

I posted about this on the Google forums last year and it didn't go anywhere. I feel like I'm being punished for doubling down on Google: if I didn't have G-Suite, the problem would at least be a lot more simple, whether or not it would go away entirely. 

I'm wondering whether I should just toss all the Google devices in favor of Amazon. I won't be penalized for having a G-Suite account. The minis we have were all sent for free over the last couple years as part of various promotions, so I'm not really out much money. All I really care about is that whatever 'local' devices we have (in place of the Minis now) will talk to SmartThings seamlessly and not announce proudly that they turned off a $#!$! light every time they do it.

duwo2m,1573497396,Lighting control setup Q,"In my ongoing quest to make my house smarter I want to automate the garage since it's small and not much work to do in that area. I have the garage door opener taken care of.  Simply enough the lights should go on when the garage door opens, lights go off when the garage door closes. Maybe introduce a motion sensor at some point. 

I have 5 overhead shop lights and each is plugged into an outlet. Of those five, one has its own dedicated switch over the workbench. The other four lights and their outlets are controlled by two switches so I could essentially turn on half the lighting on at a time. 

So now to the part my brain has been wrestling with...What's the best way to smarten up the lights? I could do this one of a few ways

&amp;#x200B;

**Put a smart plug on each of the outlets**

* Pros 
   * Fast, easy install and uninstall. 
   * Modular - Provides control over individual lights. 
   * Least expensive option (4 pack +1 VOCOlinc smart bar $77.98)
* Cons
   * Adds 5 more devices to my network and SmartHome setup
   * If someone flips a switch the lights/plugs go dead

**Replace each dumb switch with a smart switch**

* Pros
   * Fewer additional devices (3 instead of 5)
   * Lights can be controlled via switch or HomeKit
* Cons
   * Most expensive option (around $50 each switch)
   * Will require running neutral wires
   * Most time intensive installation

So with all that I'm not really sure if one way is actually better than the other. There are some trade offs either way and I don't know which one actually makes more sense.

I've been reading up on using machine learning to perform object classification.  It's something I'd like to do, but want to get recommendations on hardware and software platform.  The outcome I'd like is to be able to point a camera out the window and grab data such as:

* How many squirrels appeared in front yard?  Compare squirrel sightings this week with same week last year.
* How many cars passed in front of street?  Compare car traffic this week vs. last week.  Maybe even classify SUV vs sedans.
* How many people came up to the door.  Send MQTT message when people detected in certain frame.

So, I'm looking for a generalized object classification model mostly.  I'd like to have the data ultimately sent over MQTT maybe to something like Grafana for time series charts.

**Hardware**:  Probably Raspberry Pi 4 or Nvidia Jetson Nano w/ a Pi Camera?  Somewhere in those price ranges.

**Software**:  I'm not sure.  I've read articles using Tensorflow Lite w/ MobileNet, and XNOR.  The company XNOR has a generic object classification model is optimized for the Pi.

I don't have any familiarity with the process, except with using Hue and Arlo stuff, as well as configuring Ubiquiti gear. Here we go!

Current control platform is iOS/iPadOS so we would love Siri/Siri Shortcuts/HomeKit support to keep it aggregated.

**Current Hardware (if there are better options than what we have, please let me know):**

* Amazon Echos (x3) around the house for music/ home control
* HomePod (currently in the office)
* Google Home Hub (for the office as well)
* 20-30 Phillips Hue bulbs. Most are the A19 (?) white bulbs, we also have 4 color bulbs and two light strips behind the TV. One motion detector in the bathroom
* Arlo camera system with 5 cameras for indoor/outdoor surveillance
* 1 x Ubiquiti Unifi nano HD and 1x 24 port non PoE Ubquiti switch

Concerning the voice systems, we like the ability to control things via voice and the integrations they have. I'm not sure if Echos or Nest Hub/Google Home are better for integrations with multiple systems.

**What we would like to add (and would like recommendations on):**

* Smart Thermostat (heard that Ecobee is better than Nest for HomeKit support, not sure on Siri Shortcuts)
* Notifications on washer/dryer
* robot vacuum/mop 
* sprinkler control for either yard
* Smart Blinds (IKEA? I know these can get very very pricey, so this may be the only area we go slowly with/ place in only specific rooms)
* Doorbell with smart camera
* smart door lock
* temp sensors/leak sensors
* garage door opener?
* anything else that would improve/be a nice

dv38gj,1573524758,"HDMI, USB &amp; IR through wall","Hello,

Im just moving my rack cabinet into the garage which houses all my networking and AV etc. I have two questions/problems:

\- In the cabinet I already have quite a lot off gear but its going now going to almost fill a 36u cabinet. Examples of items include my Networking gear (UniFi modem, POE Switch, etc), AV stuff (Pioneer AVR, Vero4K+ running Kodi), HDHomerun, etc), Unraid Server (Plex, Blue Iris, Gaming VM etc), Control4 gear (Controller, Audio Matrix &amp; Amp, etc) and other rack items like Patch Panels and UPS etc.

All the Cat6 and whole home speaker cable is sorted and being distributed from the cabinet around the house. First floor cabling either goes outside the house (hidden) or under the floorboards. All first floor wiring goes straight up from the garage up into the attic then fed down through the walls. 

My living room is next to the garage so I'm feeding the main TV direct from the cabinet and only having the TV and Xbox One X in there. It would be slightly easier to pop the AVR in the living room but I want to keep it all centralised and as some games are on disc I have to put the disc in to play. As all my sources are in the rack its also easier to put the AVR in the same place also.

So getting HDMI (that's the second problem), USB (for keyboard and mouse while using gaming server and main TV), IR emitters and Cat6 to one side of the wall is fine. Also, the Cat6 will fo into 4 modules in a faceplate so networking is fine as it will have a second faceplate and modules on the living room side, its just the HDMI, USB and IR that's the problem. How can I tidily get them through the Garage Wall, Outside house wall, Cavity, Inside house wall and plaster without making a mess?!

\- My second problem might help fix the first problem as from the AVR (in the cabinet) to the TV is around 15-17 meters running around the wall so I may need a HDMI HDBaseT extender which means I could use one of the Cat6 cables for the HDMI and also the IR as most HDBaseT extenders. This just leaves me with the USB but my possible idea was to run USB to one side of the wall and attach a wireless dongle which hopefully range should reach the sofa (about 3 meters away and through the wall)? I have a Corsair Lapboard so slobbing on the sofa so if the range works it should be ok, if not, any other ideas for a today finish (even though it will all be hidden behind my Samsung 65"" QE65Q8DB).

\- Sorry, one more question. I will also need to get the Xbox One X HDMI output to the AVR in the cabinet, I take it all the HDMI extenders are all one way only? If so then any other ideas instead of buying two extenders?! Going into the garage to change game is not an option until I put a door straight through as at the moment you have to go outside. I would even go as far as to take the Blue-Ray drive out and extend that as it would be cheaper than a HDBaseT extender! A other option would be to use the SPDIF output but I don't think it does Dolby Atmos etc? What about a HDMI cable with booster and just using the Xbox One X Audio out as maybe that would require less throughput/range?

dv474m,1573529379,Nest-E + space heater,"tl;dr at the end...

I have a Nest-E running my boiler that feeds hot-water baseboard heat.  My kitchen and dining room area is woefully short of baseboard and always the coolest room, and my thermostat is just down the hall leaving the dining room, so it gets a somewhat cooler reading than it ought to.

I have a portable electric oil heater with a built-in thermostat in the kitchen to supplement the baseboard heat but of course it has no idea what my Nest wants the temp to be, so when the Nest is at my low (away weekday/overnight) temp of 63, the heater is still trying to maintain something close to my high (home weeknight/weekend) temp of 68. 

What I’d like is a setup with a smart outlet/plug that will turn on when the Nest flips to my high temp period, and off otherwise.   I presume IFTTT can be used somehow to orchestrate this. 

Otherwise I suppose I could just get a smart plug that responds to an Alexa routine/schedule that is the same as my Nest-E, as I don’t use the adaptive Nest features, it’s on a schedule. 

tl;dr  can I have a smart plug turn on when my Nest-E asks for 68 degrees, and off when it wants 63 (or at least less than 68) degrees?

dvc6e4,1573575560,Sensor that can be trained to listen for a specific sound?,"I have a toilet in my basement that I never use personally, but gets occasional use from a tenant who parks her RV on my land and comes inside to use the bathroom. If the toilet develops a bad flapper seal, stuck open flapper, or float that gets stuck and won't rise high enough to shut off the incoming water (all things that have happened over the years), I can't hear it from upstairs and it could be hours or even days before I notice that the toilet has been wasting several gallons per minute unchecked.

As a big picture solution I'm looking into the Flume water monitoring system along with a Z-wave smart valve at the main water line and Pani monitors on the showers, so if the water is running for more than 5 minutes straight and nobody is showering the water to the whole house can be shut off and an alert sent to me to investigate.

That's a comprehensive solution but will be several hundred dollars to implement, so in the short-term I was looking for something less expensive that I could hook up to the one toilet that has been responsible for 90% of my undetected water leaks that could detect a continuously running toilet and shut off water to it automatically.

So far I've only found one sensor that can detect continuous running (since it doesn't produce water on the floor that most leak sensors look for), and it's a ""dumb"" sensor that just triggers an audible alarm:  [https://smile.amazon.com/nth-Solutions-LLC-LeakAlertor-6000/dp/B01N3ARQOL/](https://smile.amazon.com/nth-Solutions-LLC-LeakAlertor-6000/dp/B01N3ARQOL/ref=sr_1_29?keywords=smart+toilet+valve&amp;qid=1573574120&amp;sr=8-29)

I already have an Insteon hub and it works admirably; should I stick with Insteon or will I face major issues in the future?

First off; I goofed when I started getting into home automation. I was really excited and didn't do nearly enough research before making purchases - so now I have Wemo light switches, TP-Link and Wemo and Insteon plugs, an Insteon hub, a couple Amazon Echo Dots and an ecobee thermostat.

I should point out that a big reason I'm considering going all-in with Insteon is that I inherited the 2nd gen hub from family. I'd prefer not to shell out on a whole new hub when I have a perfectly fine working one already for free.

dvk681,1573608356,Help me wake up please!,"Hello all! I have crippling insomnia which results in a near impossible time getting up in the morning. It’s gotten so bad that I have started sleeping through really important events (sometimes even sleeping through things that start at like 1pm). I’ve tried everything I can think of with my Alexa Spot (routines, a million alarms, smart bulbs, etc.) and nothing is working because if an alarm plays twice in two days, I’ll get used to it immediately and it has no affect on me. 

I want to use a skill where she asks me math questions in the morning, or requires that I find a specific random item (from a list of pre-entered ones) in my house to show her the barcode (had apps before that did this), or makes me do a task, or whatever. I need it to be relatively positive but the more random it can be, the better. For instance, I’d set the alarm at 8am and at 8, ideally, she’ll choose whether to ask me math questions, make me find a thing, make me recite a long text, etc., and within those options, she’ll mix it up each time (different math, items, and so on).

Anybody know where I should start? 
  1) Not interested in making any money but would gladly make available for others.
  2) I know next to nothing about coding but am a quick learner if there’s a starting template or something.
  3) Willing to find a way to make it worth your time if you make this for me (dm!). 
  4) Totally fine with using a skill that’s already out there that I can’t find.
  5) I only own an Alexa Spot and smartbulbs in my bedroom; don’t wanna buy any more devices if I can avoid it.

dvm4n3,1573617964,Help automating heating for heated garage,"Hi, I need a little bit of help finding the best way to use the space heaters that I have to keep my garage heated this winter while still utilizing the garage door. The limit on this is related to the power draw on the garage circuit breaker -- this is an old house that I am renting and have recently moved into. 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem: When I open or close the garage door, if 2 of 2 heaters are on, there is maybe a 50% chance that the circuit breaker to the garage will trip before I can open the door, drive in/out, and close the door again. Sometimes the circuit trips after opening the door all the way, occasionally it trips before getting all the way open or closed. My fear is that it will partially open and I wont notice and drive into the door. Also its a massive inconvenience to see the door fail to shut all the way and have to go reset a circuit breaker when you are trying to leave your house. My garage is not physically connected to my house.

&amp;#x200B;

goal: power off the heaters (if they are on) for 3 minutes automatically if the garage door opens (or some variation upon this; no heaters while door is not fully closed would also be acceptable). Then return of heaters to thermostat control either after a few minutes or 60 seconds after garage door has closed (to prevent heaters from powering up before garage door motor has powered off)

goal #2: switch-based triggering of 3 minute interrupt. Trigger the script causes the heaters to turn off (if on) and prevents them from powering up for 3 minutes, then automatically returns to thermostat control of heaters.

&amp;#x200B;

Heaters: 2x1500 watt space heaters.

sensors: aeotec 6 multisensor, smartthings motion sensor. 2x Inkbird temperature sensors that control the switching on and off of the heaters by temeprature and by cutting power on and off as needed.

System: Smart Things hub, wink hub, home assistant running on my NAS (newbie, just getting started)

&amp;#x200B;

Can this be solved just be putting a smartthings outlet on the outlet the thermostats plug into? Can Smartthings outlets handle that much current or will this make the garage circuit breaker even less stable?

I'm currently struggling with a routine that I have, and I'm wondering if anyone can help me out with some ideas.

I currently have a mix of Hive, plugs and bulbs and smart life plugs and bulbs, all controlled with my google home.

I have a hive door sensor, and when the door is opened between 16:00 and 00:00 my front room light comes on for 5 mins and my living room light comes on permanently. This way when I get home in the evening I can walk in my door and I have sufficient lighting for me. However the problem arises if I leave the house at say 17:00. I open the door again and my front room light comes on as does my living room light. Now the front room light is not a problem as that will switch off after 5 mins, but my main light will stay on until I arrive back. I have just been switching it off via my app when I get in my car, but I was wondering if anyone can think of a way of having it turn off automatically if I leave, but not when I arrive.

Now at the same time I have another routine where I'd like some or all of these lights to turn on by motion detection events.

dw6zrw,1573722686,"Developing a witness sensor, would love to hear if it interests people, and how you would use it","^^^^\(Posting ^^^^for ^^^^a ^^^^friend ^^^^and ^^^^asked ^^^^the ^^^^modteam ^^^^first)

Hi r/HomeAutomation ! We are a team of students in general management in Switzerland and for the last year of our master we work in relationship with a center of microtechnics and electrotechnics that developed a technology and we must find applications for it. But to do that we first want to know what people even expect from it and how you would use it!

   

But first a presentation of said device:

--------------

Our device is a sensor that measures and monitors different factors such as air quality, temperature, humidity, light and it can also use a camera to take pictures. The device is plugged on a flexible photovoltaic cell (PV cell) that can also generate power in non-direct sunlight (inside a room, house, ...). The PV cell is built as a sticker so you can basically stick it wherever you want. The device works in ultra-low-power (ULP) and communicates the data through Bluetooth LE. 

Photo of our sensor: https://i.imgur.com/93joHc8.png

We can integrate different captors (visual, sound, infra-red, chemical) it holds a battery, a memory chip and a small processor that can support an already trained IA or another basic program.

The consumer buys the number of “PV stickers and sensors” that they needs. They can use one by room to monitor their interior. Then the data can be sent (encrypted or not) to their phone / computer or monitoring device. Our goal there is to save energy and its costs by monitoring your interior simply and efficiently.

Since the device can support an already trained IA we wanted to make it open source so that any customer can create their own program and share it with the community. Which is where you might be interested?

--------------------------------------

   

We're looking for opinions, inputs, etc on this tool, especially from people with programming background (but from everyone really).

What do you think about this technology? Would you have use for it? What would you make you want to use it? And how far would you go with this?",Milleuros,/r/homeautomation/comments/dw6zrw/developing_a_witness_sensor_would_love_to_hear_if/,78,homeautomation,73

* Philips Hue lights;
* HomeKit / Google Home;

* iPhone and Apple Watch;

I started with the simplest of the ideas: once the last bedroom light is turned off, check if the iPhone is charging, and if not, do something (turn on my bed side light maybe, probably after a few minutes to give me time to put it on the charging mat).

But I often turn off all the lights and read on the smartphone to fall asleep, so that doesn't really work...

Was quoted $22,000 to do a Control4 setup to control everything and add panels in the walls to control lights and audio. I started looking into Sonos, [Brilliant.tech](https://Brilliant.tech) lightswitches, and a simple Harmony remote and figure I could replicate what they are offering for a cost of about $7500 of electronics with the ease of my being able to add speakers on my own, and I could personally do a lot of the install but with outdoor wiring and mounting I'd probably just prefer to have someone do it. I've contacted dealers that are on the Sonos website but it looks like they typically work with Control4, so are they going to work with me on something like this and not charge me an extra several thousand for a day of labor? I kind of figure these guys are going to charge for ""Design and planning"" when I've got the working plan set and I could do programming of the electronics myself. Is there a considerably cheaper way to approach things?

&amp;#x200B;

Basics of what I'd be working with. Onkyo receiver would be in a closet and just want a way to easily include additional inputs later down the road because we'd want TV to be on a wall on its own cleanly with nothing below it (if there's a better option to get multiple inputs to the TV I'd consider that). So Cable box connects to Onkyo receiver, receiver to TV, TV to Sonos Playbar which also plays on Sonos 1s for inside zone. Then create a second zone with the Sonos Amp and Sonance speakers for outside.

LG TV                             $1500

Onkyo TX 9.2                $680

Sonos Playbar              $700

Sonos 1s (3)                  $600

dwnefw,1573803511,Sensor to recognise vague motion gestures,"Hey friends,

I'm interested in your opinion: inspired by the hitchhikers guide through the galaxy, I'd like to build a control scheme which aims to make sure that "" all you had to do  was wave your hand in the general direction"" - mainly for the fun of it.

To be precise:

* can differentiate between direction of motion (up down left right)
* works with at least a few cm distance (bonus if distance can be configured variably)
* Bonus\^2 can differentiate the direction in which the gesture is made (e.g. two sensors in a distance of 30cm reacting differently depending on the sensor I'm motioning towards).
* Bonus\^3 can differentiate between gestures (but then I'll most likely dive into cameras which I'm hesitant to do atm)

I thought about a raspberry pi with several ultrasonic sensors but then I thought it's smarter to first ask around for opinions and ideas :) both DIY and of the shelf is interesting as long as it works without Cloud Services and has some API to make it implementable with OpenHAB or Home Assistant or the likes - the coding part won't be the show stopper :).

dwvqf8,1573846710,Finished My Illuminated Stairs Project!,"More pics and video of them turning on and off in the imgur link below!

Replaced the quarter round trim on my staircase with LED strip V shape aluminum extrusion, with a opaque cover. Ordered 2 sets of 5 meter long LED strip lights to be mounted in the channel. Roughly 1200 LED's in the whole setup. Drilled through my floor into the basement and ran wires down the wall in the basement. Hooked up a 12V DC power supply and a dimmer. Ran the Power supply to a GE z-wave smart switch to control with Smartthings. Had to add an outlet to plugin everything, luckily I had a box nearby I could tap into for power.  

Set it to come on at sunset, and shutoff at a set time around bedtime. Also comes on in the morning when my alarms go off, to make it easier to see going down the stairs to let the dog out. If I'm not home, they aren't on. Makes a nice low light at night making it easy to move between upstairs and downstairs without needing any other lights on. Also nice at top of stairs for when we have guests over so they can see their way into the bathroom at night without needing any other lights. 

Currently having it running at a very dim 6 watts, so it is not too bright to look at when going up stairs. Smart switch only does on/off currently. May look at doing 12v dimming in the future, but for now I really didn't see the need.

1. Know if they've left my home
2. Be able to find them if I misplace them (e.g. if I can't remember where I left my keys)

I'm envisioning something like what you'd see in stores for theft prevention where items have a tag that sets off an alarm. Except instead of setting off an alarm I want to be able to respond to events through another device. E.g. a Pi or other SoC mounted near an entrance/in a handheld scanner which will log when an item enters its proximity.

I've been looking into doing it with RFID stickers but everything I've seen so far has a range of only a few centimeters which is not adequate - I'd need at least a meter. I've looked into a few other solutions but they seem comparatively quite expensive.

I'd like to tag many different household items - basically anything that has any value or utility or is easily misplaced (including things like, e.g., pairs of scissors). I'm even toying with the idea of tagging long-lasting food items so I know when they're nearing expiration and need to be replaced. Therefore the cost per item must be low (ideally &lt; $1). I am willing to spend more (\~$100 or so?) on the core system, though.

Has anyone attempted something similar/does anyone have suggestions how I might go about this? It doesn't need to be RFID tags specifically.

Now I have pretty much everything I need I have decided to keep tabs on my progress as I move stuff from my current 16u cabinet to my new 42u Canovate cabinet and add my gear which I have bought and either not racked or opened.

So when it’s finished I will have a centralised Control4 System, UniFi networking and other manufacturers. It will include Whole House Audio, Video, Lighting, Climate Control (well only heat as in the U.K.!), Security and (hopefully) more convenient!

The cabinet I bought a few months ago was an amazing deal on a surplus stock [42u Canovate Inorax-ECO Series Rack Cabinet  ](https://canovate.com/product/inorax-eco-series-network-rack-cabinet/).

I moved into the House in July and been looking forward to doing this for some time.The cabinet is going in the Garage as it’s not used for cars. It will be split in two with 40% being a clean area with carpet, the cabinet, shelf’s, a desk etc., mini open rack I’m currently using is in the office so it’s bloody noisy mainly due to the server.

The server is a custom Unraid build using a 4u case, Supermicro X9DRH-7TF motherboard (has onboard SAS controllers and 2 x 10gbe network cards) , 2 x E5-2690-V2 CPU’s, 64GB ECC Reg RAM, Nvidia 1080Ti, 2 x 240GB SSD’s, 8 x 8TB hard drives with 2 drives as parity (unusable), Blu-Ray reader and a few PCIe cards like USB 3.0 etc. It’s used mainly for a Plex Server (Movies, TV Shows, Live TV &amp; DVR), RIP and strip UHD’s, Music (for native Control4 playback, metadata etc), Virtual Machines for various things including gaming), Time Machine backups etc

The garage is attached to the house and insulated. Heat may be a problem in the cab during summer but I’m leaving room for a 1u fan extractor and also spacing every so often.

I’m not putting anything else in till the lockable castors are put on and the garage is tidied completely. I’m also half way through wiring the Cat6 in and around the house which is powered from my switch for ethernet sockets behind TV’s, outdoor cameras including one in the dog kennels 😁, Doorbird video doorbell, sockets for my office as I have a 10gbe thunderbolt adapter for my MacBook. I’m also in the process of wiring 6 rooms (Living room, snug room, kitchen, Master bedroom, main spare bedroom and bathroom) with ceiling speakers, one of which is a single stereo for the bathroom, I never knew single stereo speakers existed! In the summer I will also be adding a outdoor zone.

Kit list for the cabinet is below followed by a few photos (might be subject to change and also will be adding a second AVR (Pioneer SC-LX501) so I have a 5.1.2 Atmos setup for the main TV (Samsung QE65QE9FN) in the living room and a 5.1 setup for my (Samsung QE55QE6FN) in the snug type room.

Inside the Cabinet:

* 1u Fan Module (to be bought)
* 1u UniFi Cloud Key 2+ rack mounted
* 1u UniFi Security Gateway Pro 4
* 1u 24 port patch panel
* 1u UniFi 24 port Switch
* 1u 24 port patch panel
* 1u UniFi 24 port POE Switch (250w)
* 1u Space
* 1u Control4 EA-3 on shelf
* 1u Control4 HC800 rack mount
* 1u Control4 HC800 rack mount
* 1u shelf for Vero 4K+, Apple TV 4K and HDBaseT 4K@60Hz Tx with USB(connected to AVR output)
* 2u shelf for Xbox One X (Controllers range is fine)
* 1u Space
* 5u Shelf for Pioneer LX-507 AVR
* 3u Control4 8-Zone Power Amplifier C4-AMP108
* 3u Control4 Audio Matrix Switch C4-16S2-E-B 25
* 1u space
* 4u Unraid Server
* 1u space
* 1u Furman M-10LX E Power Conditioner (12A outlets)
* 2u APC SMT1500RMI Smart UPS

Will do a network diagram at some point which I will find helpful. I have access to Visio on my friends laptop so may borrow that. I also really need to sort out my IP address's and make them in some kind of order and not randomly static.

Any positive/negative feedback to make it better would be great,

I have a couple of Wyze and WeMo smart plugs lying around I can use.  (I think they can all handle the amperage.)  The heater will turn on to the setting I want as soon as the switch turns on, so that's easy.  

What I'd like to do is put some sort of temperature sensor in the room and have the heater turn on when two conditions are met: when it's between 7pm and 8am (when he's sleeping) and when the room temperature falls under a certain threshold.

I have some Google Home Minis, a Sonos speaker with Alexa, and a Harmony Hub.  I imagine I will have to use some sort of IFTTT integration.

I'm looking for the best option for temperature sensors.  I have an Ecobee thermostat with room sensors, but from what I understand, you can't trigger something from an individual sensor (only from the entire thermostat).  I'd be happy to be wrong about that.

The SmartThings Multipurpose sensor seems like a decent choice.  Unfortunately, I don't have a SmartThings hub yet and I don't think the sensor works with the Harmony Hub (although some SmartThings do?  I'm not yet sure how all that works).

I've also seen the Sonoff TH16 recommended, but I don't know if I can use that with a schedule.  Unless I do something ridiculous like plug THAT into the Wyze plug... which seems silly.

Right now, I have a philips hue full colour starter kit with a dimmer switch and an Amazon Echo.

What I'm looking for, is an LED light strip that I can put along the back of my desk that I can add to my entertainment zone in the Hue Sync app along with a pair of Hue Play lights to go on the back of my monitors. It needs to be compatible with both Alexa and Apple Homekit as I will also be mounting a spare iPad onto the wall beside my bed and would like to get control through that too.

I'm also hoping to keep control of each component in the Hue app as well as I've got a plugin for my Elgato Stream Deck that lets me switch between Hue connected scenes.

I've looked at the Hue Lightstrip plus but I'm concerned about how far apart the LEDs are, that I'll be able to tell by the light against the wall where each LED is exactly. My desk is going to be 1.8m wide so a 2m set is pretty much perfect but there's SO MANY options and even after a days research, I'm still not entirely sure if Hue Sync will even support lights outside of the Hue range.

I was also consider the idea of hooking up a motion sensor under the desk so that it all lights up when I sit at it and when I leave, after a few minutes it shuts it all down.

(I was also looking at some Nanoleaf lights because of course I was but in the last 24 hours it looks like they now only sell it with the rhythm adaptor, any version without has vanished from Amazon and their own site. Fun.)

dxaoxz,1573929514,Is there a thermostat system that can progressively turn on and off individual electric heaters linked to a single thermostat zone as needed instead of switching them all on and off at the same time ?,"Quick note : this is for electric heaters, and I’m in Europe. Temperature will be expressed in °C :D.

Hi, I’m considering the purchase of infrared heaters for the living room in my appartement (in Paris, Fr.). Some examples of such heaters : Redwell, Heat4All, etc. Note : these are not the sort of old school, short wave heaters you would have found in older bathrooms. They basically look like flat panels, some of them look like a whiteboard, and some brands are more creative in terms of shapes : [https://www.redwell.com/en/](https://www.redwell.com/en/)

I’m already using a single one in my bathroom, linked to a thermostat for that room only, and I particularly like the radiant heat they emit, with rather minimal convection (a bit like a tiled stove).

However, these heaters work optimally in terms of radiance / convection ratio when their surface temperature reaches a certain degree (somewhere around 80-100° Celsius) and when they radiate heat continuously, meaning that it’s best for them to be turned on for long periods of time instead of being repeatedly turned on and off. This is where traditional thermostat systems just don’t cut it.

Let’s imagine a room with four 800 W heaters named A, B, C and D, located in various parts of the room.

Thermostat systems that I know of will turn on and off ALL heaters linked to a particular thermostat in this room (A+B+C+D) at the same time (A+B+C+D on, or A+B+C+D off). If the overall wattage in the room is way higher than needed at a particular point in time (for example, during late autumn or early spring) this will result in short, repeated ON / OFF cycles - something perfectly fine for heaters with lots of inertia, but not for infrared heaters which may struggle to reach the optimal temperature in such quick bursts and will never truly work continuously at their optimal temperature in terms of radiance / convection ratio.

An ideal thermostat system for infrared heaters would turn heater A first, and if it isn’t enough, would only then turn heater B, then C, then D. Only the last heater (D) would repeatedly turn on and off to maintain the proper temperature across several hours. The others (A, B, C) would continuously stay on until warmer days - to maintain them at the optimal temperature for long periods of time.

Do you know of any thermostat system capable of this sort of logic or am I searching for something that doesn’t exist or can’t be done ?

Thanks for your help !

I already have a cat 5e/6 run to every corner of my house with POE switches to run my wifi APs.

It seems like a huge missed opportunity since POE gives both power, and rocksolid bandwidth to any device that needs it, even in hard to reach places where cameras are mounted.

The house has a few ""floors"", which are like one/two step stairs into other rooms as well as pretty high doorsteps between most rooms. It seems this is something of a problem for many of the ""smarter"" robots as they need to keep track of the different floors without the possibility of driving around to map everything out. 

I have been looking specifically at the Roborock S4 (don't really believe the mop is up to my standards), but its only available through [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de) here in Europe and the price is almost on par with the S5 (none-Max). 

For now I am mainly thinking about if my intended use is possible. I would place the base station in our biggest room. Assuming it cannot go over the door steps, then I would move it around the rooms one day at the time and have it clean then. Is this even possible while still using all the nice features of mapping the rooms, no-go lines etc.?

(In b4 ""Just google dickhead"", it takes someone with knowledge 10 seconds to respond, it would take me hours upon hours if I take the wrong direction while I'm gathering knowledge. Thanks!)

1) For a network of devices (bulbs, sockets, microcontrollers) (probably around 25 devices), should I look into setting up a bluetooth network or make sure everything has a wifi-interface and use my existing router as the main-hub? (Which is easier to set up? What is better (and why)? When would I choose which?)

2) Smart sockets (I'm sure this is a common discussion): What is the cheapest yet reliable smart socket option? I'm looking for something that can switch on/off, monitor power (though this isn't absolutely necessary), and has wifi or bluetooth interface for remote on/off (based on results from question 1).

I got access to Fibaro ID and changed user credentials, app worked great but then I wanted to reconfigure scenes and names of rooms and of course the credentials to the admin access were lost. So support removed the HC2 and asked me to re-add it, mentioning that this will lose all configurations and I would need to add them again. Really looking forward to prying open all sockets and switches... Right now the HC2 seems to work (motion sensors trigger lights like before)

From Fibaro ID I remember there were two remote accesses, one offline (had same name as on app) and another was the HC2 that was removed. There is an older iPad that has the old Fibaro app and that discovery shows two HC devices, whats the deal? is one hidden, even if so why would there be two?

Questions:

* Can I somehow discover z-wave devices because I don't actually know what the house has to full extent?
* Any suggestions on the transfer part? Is there a workaround not to lose the config? 
* Previous setup was done by local home automation company, any tips and tricks installers use (some markings or best practices) that would guide me?

dy4kjb,1574090633,"PSA to people looking to get started with automation during the holiday sales: Voice assistants and hubs are not the same thing, and Google's Nest hub is NOT a hub","As we approach Black Friday, a piece of advice for people looking to get started. 

A voice assistant is not a hub. It may mimic some the the same functions, but it's simply a server side aggregator. It's the mouth and ears of your smart home, but a hub is the brain. 

If you are just getting started, save yourself some pain and frustration, and buy a real hub now. Build yourself a system that is expandable, instead of one thing at a time that technically *should* work with your voice controller. Buy Zwave or Zigbee devices instead of WiFi when possible. There's half a dozen hubs out there that support those protocols. These protocols are universal. So it doesn't matter which manufacturer you pick, you can mix and match different brands. They can't be rendered obsolete and stop working because the company that made them chose to stop support, or goes out of business (WiFi devices can fall to this, and several have).

SmartThings is a good jack of all trades, cheap, entry-level hub. It supports a huge variety of devices and server side integrations so your voice controller will work to control your devices still. But, popular choices also include: Hubitat, HomeSeer, Indigo, DIY a HomeAssistant set up, and others. 

Also, when doing lighting go for switches instead of bulbs. The only time bulbs make sense is if you are renting, have a home without neutral wires, or you *have* to have color changing capabilities. Switches are cheaper because they control more than one bulb generally, they let you use bulbs that are cheaper to replace as they burn out, and guests know how to use them intuitively. They don't remove existing dumb functionality like bulbs do. They still work as a normal switch, but have the ability for smart control on top. 

And for Google's Nest Hub, that's not a hub. They are playing fast and loose with the term hub, in a way that's misleading and irresponsible. It would be like a company introducing a new SUV called the ""Hill Climber AWD"" but for Max fuel efficiency it's a 2 wheel drive car and they never tell you that anywhere.

dy4q0u,1574091334,"PSA to people looking to get started with automation during the holiday sales: Voice assistants and hubs are not the same thing, and Google's Nest hub is NOT a hub","As we approach Black Friday, a piece of advice for people looking to get started. 

A voice assistant is not a hub. It may mimic some the the same functions, but it's simply a server side aggregator. It's the mouth and ears of your smart home, but a hub is the brain. 

If you are just getting started, save yourself some pain and frustration, and buy a real hub now. Build yourself a system that is expandable, instead of one thing at a time that technically *should* work with your voice controller. Buy Zwave or Zigbee devices instead of WiFi when possible. There's half a dozen hubs out there that support those protocols. These protocols are universal. So it doesn't matter which manufacturer you pick, you can mix and match different brands. They can't be rendered obsolete and stop working because the company that made them chose to stop support, or goes out of business (WiFi devices can fall to this, and several have).

SmartThings is a good jack of all trades, cheap, entry-level hub. It supports a huge variety of devices and server side integrations so your voice controller will work to control your devices still. But, popular choices also include: Hubitat, HomeSeer, Indigo, DIY a HomeAssistant set up, and others. 

Also, when doing lighting go for switches instead of bulbs. The only time bulbs make sense is if you are renting, have a home without neutral wiring, or you *have* to have color changing capabilities. Switches are cheaper because they control more than one bulb generally, they let you use bulbs that are cheaper to replace as they burn out, and guests know how to use them intuitively. They don't remove existing dumb functionality like bulbs do. They still work as a normal switch, but have the ability for smart control on top. 

And for Google's Nest Hub, that's not a hub. They are playing fast and loose with the term hub, in a way that's misleading and irresponsible. It would be like a company introducing a new SUV called the ""Hill Climber AWD"" but for Max fuel efficiency it's a 2 wheel drive car and they never tell you that anywhere. So, many people find out after they bought the car that AWD is their marketing term for being ""Always Walking Distance"" from your goal. And as a consumer you should have researched that ahead of time and just known that their AWD isn't what everyone expects it to be.

dy714o,1574101236,Power Monitor,"I needed to be able to monitor whether there was power at a certain location, and be able to control smart devices and get notifications based on a change of status. I couldn't find anything like that so I made one and thought it might be useful to share.

My use cases were as follows: 

1. I have a Tesla Powerwall backup and when we lose power, I wanted to be able to shut down a few high demand loads that are on backed up circuits. Fortunately there are non backed up circuits too, so I plugged the device into a non-backed up outlet and when the power goes away, it trips an automation in ST that turns off whatever devices I want out of the equation.

2. I am on well water, which is stored in a 5k gallon tank. Occasionally, if something goes awry, the tank will run out of water, which causes the pump to run dry, frying an expensive pump. It's also useful to realize that the water level is low before it becomes an issue. The first pass solution was just a blinking light on the side of the well house, but unless you're home and looking that way, it's easy to miss. I added an outlet on the same circuit as the blinking light which is only powered up in a fault condition.

So what I came up with was a ST multipurpose sensor, and replaced the normal magnet with a small electromagnet powered by a USB cord plugged into a phone charger type power adapter. As long as there's power, it says the sensor is closed, and if it loses power, it says the sensor is open. Create automations in ST hub based on whatever condition change makes sense (closed to open in the first case, or open to closed in the second) and then you can have it do whatever you want.

Not sure if this is the best place to ask this, so sorry if it doesn't really fit,

She originally had planned to do the standard bayonet socket in the middle of the room and get a LED bulb to go in

However I floated the idea about getting some led strips and putting them aroudn the edge of the room, hidden, to be able to create a more dynamic lighting  
My idea was facing up to bounce light off the roof, but also have some smaller strips under furniture and such so we can light the floor without lighting the whole room for things like movie nights where you want to be able to see to get food and walk about but not have the whole room lit up.

And it got me thinking about the other advantages and disadvantages of Single LED bulb vs strips

Would power usage be a factor? Power draw for 1 bulb vs a strip  
Keeping in mind the strip wouln't have to be nearly as bright to keep the room lit

The app and control experience of the ecobee is more feature-rich and useful, especially for remotely managed properties with the alerts.  Nest looks and feels more high-end (glass + metal vs plastic) and the colors integrate into the decor better than black and white.

* Why did I buy both?  My home is nearly all Amazon, but the cabin is 100% Google.  But it only matters in some edge cases (e.g. if you have Nest Protects). Where Google wins is the Google Home app can manage multiple properties, each with multiple rooms/device groupings.  Alexa only understands device groupings so you can't have a nest of nests.

* Packaging, included accessories, was slick with both.  Nest was more elegant and included a screwdriver and drywall friendly screws (no anchors required) for a ""no extra tools required"" install.  The screws provided with the ecobee look like the need the provided anchors.  I didn't use them and instead used drywall screws as I find anchors will even loosen over time. ecobee plastic material feel is cheaper top to bottom.  Nest feels like metal and glass.  The colored rings and backing plate of the Nest better integrate into your decor.

* Physical install process was equally good.  Wire labels, optional backing plates, great instructions.  App-based installation instructions for both were almost identical.  Slight nod to ecobee for having videos as part of the app install instructions but I never watched them.  The wire clamps seemed a bit stronger on the ecobee baseplate.  I had some trouble with one wire slipping out of the Nest backing plate. ecobee does provide a power extender kit whereas Nest doesn't require a C wire in most cases where there isn't one.  

* Thermostat power-up and setup was easier with the ecobee since more could be done via the thermostat itself as it has a touchscreen, so entering alphanumeric characters on a virtual keyboard is easier than the Nest's jogwheel.  

* Display.  Tough one.  ecobee display is dim and pixelated but it displays so much more info and is a touchscreen.  If you're not going to touch it much, the Nest looks more elegant with a bright crisp display that can be read across a room and higher end materials, but it is very minimalist.

* App functionality is where the two diverge and ecobee being easier, more features, and with nice surprises.  For instance, on the ecobee you can set a min/max temp range restriction so people can't accidentally set the heat to 90F for instance.  ecobee can send notifications for low/high temp and humidity which I love as I've experienced the occasional furnace failure.  ecobee can cycle the fan every hour to redistribute air if you'd like.  I didn't see these features in the Nest app.

* Learning modes.  Our patterns are not regular so I'm not using the learn function on either thermostat.  ecobee is much easier to set a weekday/weekend schedule like old school thermostats.  You can set up all weekdays in one step whereas Nest requires you to copy days over.

* Voice.  If you have no other voice devices, the ecobee with voice is handy.  But I have voice devices everywhere and both thermostats can be controlled from either Alexa or Google.  I wonder if the Alexa integration made a c-wire mandatory with the extra power requirements.

* Sensors. I didn't order extra sensors for the Nest based on reviews here which said they were useless as they didn't average the temperatures or move based on occupancy.  The free sensor with the ecobee is handy as we put it in the room we spend the most time in.

* Support. I had zero need to contact support.

So far, I would recommend ecobee over Nest because of the feature richness.  I would only choose Nest if you care more about looks/feel.

That's it for now.  If people find this useful, I'll provide an update in a week once history data and so forth populate and I've lived with the two.",gmcturbo,/r/homeautomation/comments/dyfsbs/installed_a_nest_3rd_gen_ecobee_smart_w_voice/,37,homeautomation,15

I'm thinking about getting started in Home Automation.  I've got, well, next to nothing right now, aside from a few Google Home Mini's.

My biggest grievance right now is around HVAC -- I'm in an older home with just baseboard heat, three zones (one for all bedrooms, one for all common areas, one for the basement), and my window AC's in the summer aren't thermostatically controlled at all.

Obviously I know I've only got 2-wire thermostat cables and will have to replace them to get just about any smart thermostat installed.

But I notice a lot of smart thermostats now have remote room sensors, and that got me thinking.

I'm looking primarily at the Honeywell T9 right now, but I'm open to Ecobee and Nest if it can do what I'm thinking:

 - Install one thermostat in the master bed (HVAC zone 2)
 - Install remote sensors in each of the two other upstairs beds (HVAC zone 2)
 - Install another thermostat in the living room (HVAC zone 1)
 - Install remote sensor in the dining room (HVAC zone 1)
 - Install Window AC's in each bedroom, living room, dining room.  All my AC's automatically turn on when power is restored from an outage.
 - Put smart plugs on each of the AC's
 - **Use the thermostat and remote temp sensors to control the AC's in the rooms where they are located.**

dykpor,1574171731,I don’t know why I’m automating,"My setup:

- 4 google home minis (bedroom, living room, nursery,tv room)
- 1 google home nest “hub” in the kitchen
- 3 TP-Link switches connect into lamps in living room
- 1 TP-Link switch connect to lamp in bedroom
- 3 Logi Circle 2 cameras (one window mounted at front entrance, one outside overlooking backyard, third being used in nursery)

I just bought a SmartThings hub with 3 multipurpose sensors and a button. 1 sensor is on the front door, the other on the back door, third is attached under baby mattress to detect vibration and temp in there. Button is used to “arm” the “security” app because I don’t know what else to do with it. 

I don’t know why I have this stuff. I’m not at all worried about the security of my home. We live in a safe neighbourhood and a pretty good community of people looking out for one another. 

The cameras were neat to see some wildlife walk by the front door every now and then (by wild life I mean cats, a skunk, a possum). 

I did see a guy bike up and check the door on my car once but the video didn’t show any useful info about him and honestly I’d rather not know about these minor attempts to steal from our cars. We lock our car doors anyways and have nothing of value in there. 

The door sensors trip all the lights on when the security app is armed but I really don’t expect for that to be the thing that wakes me up. More like breaking glass or kicking the door in. 

The SmartThings hub seems to have a gap between the SmartThings routines and apps I can easily setup, vs learning to code for WebCore. I want to do more than what’s natively available in the app but I don’t have time to dig into webcore. Like I want the security app to trigger my google home speakers if the alarm is tripped but I can’t seem to easily set that up. 

My home is small and it’s easier to flick a light switch than use a voice command or app. 

I’m mostly happy with just google home and it’s music/radio streaming across the house and the lamps being turned on and off with an easy voice command or daily schedule. 

I feel like there’s potential to do stuff, I just don’t see what it is or why it might be necessary.

I was recently fortunate enough to move into a rather large UK based Victorian townhouse. It has 7 bedrooms across 3 floors with a large basement. One of the issues with a house of this size is heating (particularly as it has very high ceilings and single glazed wooden sash bay windows on the front elevation).

I am a software developer so having to tinker with config etc is not a problem (arguably it's a bonus :D ), though the rest of my family (particularly my wife) is less technologically comfortable so whatever I setup has to be stable.

I have currently got a Hive Active Heating system in place with Alexa devices in most rooms and have also been tinkering with (though i'm not too fixated on) [hass.io](https://hass.io) running on a homelab VM currently coupled with a Phillips Hue bulb, Ikea Tradfri (gateway, motion detector and switch), knockoff Aqara heat/humidity sensors and a conbee 2 on a raspberry pi.

Before I start getting too serious about lighting and sensors I would like to add smart TRVs to the mix as I'm certain it could save on my heating bills. One option is the Hive TRVs as it will play nice with my Hive Heating, however my understanding is that I would need the Hive repeaters in order to get the signal throughout the house (for comparison I have 6 ubiquiti in wall wireless access points to get good wifi throughout), and Hive doesn't seem to play well with other non Hive devices.

If I went for another brand I could potentially add them to the existing stuff I have been tinkering with using [hass.io](https://hass.io) \- but will it play nicely with the Hive Heating, and what's the best system in terms of TRVs and extenders that will work on any generic zigbee mesh? (I think I'm leaning towards the conbee as the master controller rather than tradfri as I have more control over it and range seems better).

Frankly the fact that repeaters don't repeat multiple mesh networks feels like a design flaw when every provider is using their own proprietary controller hub and interoperability is limited (particular for OTA firmware updates).

Is there a solution to bringing all this technology together in an open standard way, or am I asking too much of today's technology and should I just accept I am going to have to have multiple meshes with multiple repeaters on each mesh?",LloydPickering,/r/homeautomation/comments/dynmqm/zigbee_repeaters_multiple_meshes_and_trv_heating/,1,homeautomation,1

A few things I now know I want/don't want through the basic internet research I've done;

* wifi will not reach the attic, so a smart switch relying on wifi is not ideal
* as mentioned before, we would like a physical switch to attach to the wall
* at this point we have bigger fish to fry than investing in smart home devices (new windows, new flooring, new kitchen, etc.) so comparability with Alexa, Google, etc. not necessary
* the simpler the better - looked at Philips Hue smart bulbs, but don't want to have to get the Hue Bridge for 2 lights

The instructions and everything I could find online suggest there should be two traveler wires, one that runs to the other switch and one to the light.  The wiring in my home only has one traveler wire in each switch, so I'm not sure what do to.  When installing the smart switch I tried each traveler wire from the smart switch to the traveler wire in the box.  One of them the smart switch turns on and I can connect to it through the app, but it doesn't turn the light on/off and the other switch doesn't work.  The other traveler wire from the smart switch - smart switch doesn't come on/connect in the app but I can use the other switch to turn the light on/off.

Any ideas?",xris831x,/r/smarthome/comments/dyri58/trouble_installing_a_treatlife_three_way_smart/,0,smarthome,5

I posted a tablet survey two weeks ago, and have compiled the results into a google doc.

The purpose of the survey was to gather information tablet usage in home automation. What people are using in their home automation setup, how they've mounted it, what apps they're using, how happy they are with the results, etc. This was in anticipation of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals approaching.

There were some options in there that were HomeAssistant related, mainly because I designed the survey with that ecosystem in mind. 

I hope this helps you with your own decision making!

dz2x1f,1574260805,Home Assistant and Google Assistant control of dedicated local music server,"I have an unusual need.  I have a player piano that is driven by custom audio tracks, of which I have hundreds.  These tracks have one channel for the piano, and one for optional mono audio accompaniment to play through a speaker.

At present I have a linux box that drives this, with the music in Rhythmbox, said box hardwired to the piano and a speaker underneath. Long ago I set that up to do airplay so it could be controlled from a cell. It works.

I now have a home controlled by Home Assistant, and initiate most functions by commands to Google Homes scattered about, as well as automations in Node Red.  That all works great also.   With Google Assistant I can also play selected tracks from Google Play Music to any cast device or google home.

Ideally, I would like a local media server I can control by voice commands \_and\_ home assistant automation, and that would run on linux. Linux because there's other piano stuff on that dedicated box like custom music sheet reader, and midi player. I do not want to mix the piano music and regular audio on Google Play Music as if you play the piano music on an audio device you just get a loud squeal.   I don't think I can have two GPM accounts (tied to the same home for home assistant). 

Plex has a module (Phlex I think) but I see more bad about it than good.  Plus Plex carries so much baggage, and for this one device my needs otherwise are really simple -- maintain songs, playlists, and play to one output.  No syncs, no multi-device, multi-users, etc. And that seems to be about it.  Are there others I should consider?  

Side note: I have been using and liking MediaMonkey, the V5 beta does google sync, but doesn't appear to have any voice integration.

 \*  When using the moreHeat, lessHeat, moreCool, and lessCool thresholds based on an outdoor temp sensor or weather station, the check\_if\_hold\_justified() routine will take into account the null values to revert the adjusted setpoints if needed.

 \* Added more tracing in the code for those use cases

dz3t81,1574264778,Caution about Twinkly Christmas Lights,"Hi all!

With Christmas right around the corner I wanted to take a minute to let people know about my experience with Twinkly in case you were thinking of getting their fabulous looking Christmas lights.

I will say that right from the moment I saw these lights I knew I would love them!  Fast forward to a few days later and I am cursing and swearing and contacting support etc.

Bought these last year, I had two sets of the 150 lights.  Long story short.  If you want these to work you will want to have only one set.  After so much troubleshooting myself returning different strands, getting new ones etc.  It appears as though once you have 2 sets on your network they start to go crazy.  Even if added a new separate network they would not play nice anymore.  Randomly they would disconnect and not be pingable.  I would be running a consistent ping and would do nothing to the network and you would see the lights come on be pingable for a few sec, turn off come back on etc.  If you remove the 2nd set there wouldn't be as much up and down and they would work, but randomly stop and then start again with a different programmed pattern etc.

I also went as far as to remove my current router, install a new router and only put the lights and my phone on that router just to make sure it wasn't something on my network...still the same issues.

Support is a complete joke.  They will only respond via e-mail, weeks if not months in between e-mails.  They want you to do the normal reset, repair etc.  I had all the technical details that I could collect myself.  Ping tests, the exact time the lights would go offline etc.  Provided all this information to show them it is their lights that is the issue and nothing.  I have been waiting since June for a set of replacement lights.  I e-mailed just the other day asking where they were and I was told that they are being prepared to ship.   They have been prepared to ship for months.  So I know I will never see the replacements.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of these lights are great, but it seems as thought they haven't figured out the technology yet!

So this year I purchased the NOMA smart lights from Canadian Tire - They do work with multiple strands, but the grouping is not well thought out.  If you have them hung across the front of your house and you have a cascading effect happen it will start at opposite ends of the lights and meet in the middle instead of the start at end 1 and finish at end 2.

If anyone knows of anything similar to the twinkly lights for a tree please do let me know.  These NOMA ones I bought are good for outdoors, but they will not be good for a tree.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE - Thanks everyone for responding.  I finally got a response last night from Twinkly and I have a shipping label created now!  The timing is rather interesting..almost like someone saw my post =)  They are coming from Italy so who knows if I will get them in time for Christmas, but I will update and let everyone know if these are any better.

dz3tix,1574264810,Specific question about home automation hubs,"Hello all! 

I am hoping some of you can provide some clarity in helping me select a hub. My goal is to build out automation leveraging boolean logic based off variables both internal to my network (ie; status of devices) and external (perhaps via an API or IFTTT - ie; the weather outside). 

I'm looking for an option whose interface enables me to build something like this: 

IF sensor detects door opening 
AND (local time is within an hour of sunset or after OR ambient light levels are low)
THEN wait five seconds, turn on smart plugs, turn on hue bulbs, play music from spotify at volume level X 
ELSE leave lights / outlets off, only play music

This is only an example, but I have many ideas similar to the above that I'd like to set up and get working together. I love tinkering with stuff and am technically inclined. 

I've done a fair bit of research, but can't seem to verify which of the hubs can do something like this most effectively. These are the devices / services I currently use, and ideally I would find something compatible with all of them: 

- LG c8 TV
- Apple iPhone household
- Philips hue bridge &amp; ~12 bulbs
- Kasa TP Link smart outlets

dz677b,1574275015,Here's how to use Wipro's Smart lights with IFTTT (India only),"Sometime last year (or the year before that) Indian IT company Wipro launched Wi-fi enabled smart lights in the market. Apart from the fact that they are some of the cheapest smart lights in the market as of now, one thing that attracted me towards Wipro was that they are the only company to have a [20w tubelight](https://www.amazon.in/Batten-Compatible-Amazon-Google-Assistant/dp/B07P7JNQ56). All other companies are only selling 7-12w smart bulbs, which are not very useful for regular sized rooms, unless you put at least two. Besides, Wipro was also advertising compatibility with IFTTT, which was a major advantage in my point of view, having been a long time user of IFTTT. So I ordered a smart bulb for my bedroom and the tubelight for my living room.

I was in for a major disappointment. IFTTT didn't seem to have Wipro's service listed. Not only that, Wipro's app is a huge letdown. On my phone, there's a black bar on top which covers the essential buttons in the app, rendering the app practically useless. I was fairly annoyed, having just spent close to ₹2000 based on false advertisement. However, I decided to keep using the lights as they were working well with Google Home and Alexa (installed on my phone). 

But being curious, I decided to dig around, hoping to find a way to improve the experience. After some searching and reading, I discovered that Wipro's software is basically just a licensed version of [Tuya Inc.](https://en.tuya.com/)'s app. Now Tuya Inc. makes another app named Smart Life, which is compatible with IFTTT. So I decided to give this app a try.

I reset my Wipro bulb and tried pairing it with smart life. And voila, it got paired just as easily as with Wipro's app. Next I tried pairing the LED Batten. Worked well for that as well. 

Now this app is fully functional, it has zero bugs (so far) and has more functionality than Wipro's app. Also, IFTTT has a service called Smart Life which I could now use to control my Wipro bubl. So I connected the service with IFTTT and it worked like charm (well, not exactly, but it worked, eventually).

There's another problem though. While the tubelight shows up in IFTTT, for some reason, the bulb doesn't. This is not a Wipro problem, but a Tuya Inc. problem as I found this mentioned in other posts as well, which were talking about Smart Life app. However, that doesn't mean you can't control your bulb with IFTTT, it's just a 2-step process.

Step 1 - In the Smart Life app, first define some tap-to-execute rules which control the bult

Step 2 - Execute this scenario with IFTTT instead

et voilà! You are now using the smart bulbs the way they were really meant to be, not in the stunted state Wipro has managed to sell it in.

Bonus tip: If you use Tasker, you can use webhooks to trigger IFTTT tasks and control the smart bubs through Tasker as well. 

**tl;dr**

Wipro imports bulbs from China and licenses software from a US company. While doing nothing, it still manages to fuck up the app.

So buy Wipro lights, **don't use Wipro app,** download Smart life app instead, and enjoy an actual smart light experience.",magestooge,/r/homeautomation/comments/dz677b/heres_how_to_use_wipros_smart_lights_with_ifttt/,11,homeautomation,7

I would like to replace this switch with a WiFi switch (Kasa probably) and then change out the lamps with Philips Hue bulbs.

I have an artificial christmas tree with LED lights that was on the tree when I bought it. 

The wiring has a foot switch, a power supply and a small controller that lets me set five different light levels.  
This is fine, but I want to connect it into my home automation (I use HA) system and thought that I could be able to connect an ESP8266 to it and simulate button press on the controller.

But, I need some help figuring out how this thing works. What I have learned so far:

* Output from power supply is 31VDC
* Foot switch is on/off
* When cycling through the different steps on the controller, voltage out goes from approx. 31.18-30.78VDC in these five steps

What I need help with is:

* When I use the rubber button, the controller cycles through each voltage, all good. When I try to short the switch circuit with a screwdriver, it seems like I am cycling two steps at a time. What is the reason for this?
* What would be the best way to simulate a button press with a microcontroller?
* How does this board work exactly?

dzfeqc,1574318970,That's it. I'm adding robot repair to my resume.,"So I've got a roborock S50, had it for about 6 months, and love it. And then a few weeks ago, it suddenly stopped. Error 1. Check laser head. No amount of checking would resolve it. While technically still under warranty, the local supplier I bought it from is known for being very dodgy when it comes to those kind of things, and frankly, it looked like a lot of work. But really, what could be wrong right?

So i pulled the top part apart, and found a rather fascinatingly modular laser positioning system. Didn't take much to get to it, and it just pops right out. Watched some youtube and googled around a bit, and found this is actually a relatively common problem. Most people seemed to be fixing it by replacing the whole module, but at 1/4 the cost of the machine, that seemed a bit extreme. 

So, i dug into it a bit more. \*why\* wasn't it working. First thing I noticed was that it wasn't spinning. The LDS needs to spin to scan the room as it moves, but it wasn't. So I checked out the motor that spins it by a belt. Moved freely by hand, but didn't when the machine tried to power on. So popped it all out and got my tools. Multimeter across the motor showed \~0v. Well, that'll do it. Unplugged the motor, and traced back those pins. Turns out the motor power comes directly from inside the vacuum, it's not powered/controlled by the LDS module. 

With the motor unplugged, I can now read +5v on the pins, so that's great. Tried assembling again, reconnect motor, now it's 0v again. So it's the motor. Progress. More googling suggests others have indeed also got to this point. Some even had some luck by applying a more solid 5v PSU to it, to 'unstick' it internally. Even found a report of a guy using a 9v battery to ""kick"" it over. Tried both, but sadly, no luck, neither would make it run either. 

So found out, I can get spares for the motor alone. A lot cheaper too. About $20AUD delivered, give or take. Well, the part turned up today! So time to re-assemble!

Replaced the motor, perfect fit, plugged in, and fired it up on the bench, didn't even need to test for 5v now, she's spinning and almost immediately tries to run off and clean my desk!

Shut it down, and reassemble the lot, put it ALL back together nicely (no spare bits left over, always a good sign) -- and ... Error 1. WHAT? it was just working!

Pull it apart again, and check it out, nothing too obvious. Then I check the motor. Oops. Ran the cable on the wrong side, looks like as it drops into the cavity. it's quite a tight fit, and very thin wires, they'd snapped off 1/2 up the cable. Fine. Rejoined, soldered and taped off, then reinstalled the motor the correct way, ran the cabling better and reconnected. This time i restarted its cleaning process after each step assembling. About 6 in all. Worked perfectly now. 

And well, it's back off and cleaning agian now! And if myself or my wife ever doubted how much it cleans, lets just say, 2-3 weeks with it out of action was beginning to become noticible around the place.

dzlkd9,1574352898,Looking to begin converting my home to a smart home. (Advice wanted!),"Hello everyone!

Since smart controls and features came out I immediately wrote them off as spy devices and something I do not want to install in my home. I still feel this way about cameras and any device that ""listens"" in to receive commands.

However, I have recently looked into many smart devices and am interested in upgrading my home with some. I'm not sure exactly what I want to do or what is even possible with the tech out now but here is a list of things I want and need advice on. Any research / reading materials you can point me to that explains this stuff would be great. I consider myself tech savy, better at hardware and software than networking, but I can figure stuff out. This being said, think of me as boomer level knowledge with how smart devices function and network. 

Things I am wanting to definitely have:

* LED lighting strips in kitchen under cabinets and maybe above that can be controlled remotely and change colors etc. 

* I think I want smart light switches / bulbs so I can control light level and turn on / off remotely. Maybe color options for some rooms buy dont need multi color lights in all rooms. 

* I already have an Orbit B-Hyve 4 zone sprinkler control I installed earlier this year. I love using it and the app is great. If the hub i eventually purchase and install supports their products this would be a plus to me.

dzlkkr,1574352925,Upgrade security camera to smart home,"Hey community,

As Christmas is rolling around the corner, I was thinking of a gift for my parents' place. They had a video security system installed about 7 years ago and although the cameras work, they're connected to a hub which no one knows how to use. The cameras are displaying live feeds on a computer and that's it. 

I wanted to upgrade them to a Smart Home configuration so that we can record the footage and monitor the feeds through our phones. However, I want to know if there is a way to use the existing cameras since they were expensive at the time and the installation on the exterior a 3-floor home is a nightmare. I see many video kits but they come with their own cameras. Is there anything that would work where I can salvage the old hardware?",athanc,/r/smarthome/comments/dzlkkr/upgrade_security_camera_to_smart_home/,2,smarthome,5
dzlpq4,1574353506,Looking to begin converting my home to a smart home. (Advice wanted!)," Hello everyone!

Since smart controls and features came out I immediately wrote them off as spy devices and something I do not want to install in my home. I still feel this way about cameras and any device that ""listens"" in to receive commands.

However, I have recently looked into many smart devices and am interested in upgrading my home with some. I'm not sure exactly what I want to do or what is even possible with the tech out now but here is a list of things I want and need advice on. Any research / reading materials you can point me to that explains this stuff would be great. I consider myself tech savy, better at hardware and software than networking, but I can figure stuff out. This being said, think of me as boomer level knowledge with how smart devices function and network.

Things I am wanting to definitely have:

* LED lighting strips in kitchen under cabinets and maybe above that can be controlled remotely and change colors etc.
* I think I want smart light switches / bulbs so I can control light level and turn on / off remotely. Maybe color options for some rooms buy dont need multi color lights in all rooms.
* I already have an Orbit B-Hyve 4 zone sprinkler control I installed earlier this year. I love using it and the app is great. If the hub i eventually purchase and install supports their products this would be a plus to me.
* I want a smart doorbell with an app and real time alerts. I do not want a subscription and local storage is ideal for me. I've been looking at Eufy and I think Blink also meets this requirement?

Other than this, suggestions for devices / things I can do are always welcomed. My budget right now is fairly flexible and I can afford an initial investment into these things probably up to $1000.

dzluxa,1574354086,Does smart light bulbs work on other app (not google home),"Hello,

Short version:

Does smart light from one company work in other smart light apps which are not Google Home?

&amp;#x200B;

Longer version and my confusion: 

A lot of smart light pulp works on their own app and on Google Home (great! Awesome, you only need one app to control)

I just dont find the Google Home app so useful as some of the other apps provided by the smart light manufactures. 

This have now brought me into a hassle. I have lights from SmartLife (which also work in Google Home), but what if I buy other smart light from an other company which also support Google Home, will that also work in my SmartLife app? (I know it will work in Google Home)  


Im kind of wondering: by allowing it to go on Google Home, it kind of opening up, so it will work like open source or something like that. Or do the manufacture choose only their app and Google Home. 

E.g. Bluetooth, one device with bluetooth i allowed in many app and controlled by a lot of things. Is that the same with smart light? 

Im sorry if my explanation is confusing, but I really dont know the right words for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just hate that I need to stick to one smart company. I know Google Home solve it. I just like the other app better.

There are benefits to conduit definitely, but depending on your layout, does it really make sense other than a few key areas? (This question is for low voltage only).

I'm renovating a two story house with attic and crawl space (key fact) which will provide plenty of access to run wiring in the future to any room. It seems to me that the only areas that conduit adds real value in this setup is in a network closet from the crawl space to the attic, and maybe one or to other fixed media locations to the attic or crawl space.  Pre-installing empty conduit around the house for possible future needs fixes you to locations you may not want later, and with attic/crawl access, doesn't provide much benefit to just running a wire when you know you need it. 

Related to that, if prewiring runs around $100 per run, you can save quite of bit of $$ to spend on fun equipment running it yourself later when a specific need arises vs. guessing and running wire all around day 1. This of course assumes you are ok with DIY, but I find some fun in that.  In my scenario, prewiring with the walls open seems to only make sense for first floor ceiling runs (WAP, audio) and probably security/sensors to windows/doors on both floors.

People have a different balance between $$ for a 3rd party and their own time/labor, but running cable as needed from the attic or crawl space doesn't seem too bad to me if that option is available.

&amp;#x200B;

My main goal is to have lights/temperature/cameras controlled by the system and anything extra is a bonus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently i'm working with 3x google homes, 2x smart globes, 1x smart powerpoint and have been tinkering with home assistant on a raspberry pi. The new place will also have an aircon unit that is controllable by wifi(simple api that I should pretty easily be able to monitor/plug into). 

&amp;#x200B;

My first questions are relating to raspberry pi/ha. 

1) I'm currently running hassbian on the pi as I found it easier to control/install other services, will the machine be ok with other things running in the background or is it normal to leave ha to its own device and run things like pi-hole on another?

2) If i'm using the raspberry pi with ha will I also need to get a hub to control my devices? My aim would be that everything would be neat and tidily controlled in the once place but if I need to spread around a few hubs that shouldn't be an issue(relates to next question)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been eyeing off some of the aqara/xiaomi smart items as they seem decent for the price, i'd probably mainly be trying to pick up temp sensors/body sensor and maybe cameras/light switch. 

3) My understanding is they will require the hub which operates on the zigbee protocol but they are able to be changed to mqtt using zigbee2mqtt? I've read a little into this but nothing more, would this be advised or is just using the hubs the easier way to go?

4) Should I end up going the hub route is there much difference between the aqara vs xiaomi products? I've had a hard time finding much difference between the 2 lines.

&amp;#x200B;

Final 2 questions,

5) doorbell cameras, is something like ring the best option or are there equivalent solutions that just don't put the same effort into marketing and being everywhere like ring seems to?

6) Simply switching over the panel for a light switch to make it smart seems like the smartest way to go, i've never done any wiring or electrical work, is this something that i'd be able to do or will I need to get in an electrician for this type of thing? And do I need to take note of the country for products like light switches or will most work across the globe?

&amp;#x200B;

It is adjusted the temperature according to weather.

It is very easy to integrate any digital device with this device due to easy connectivity. Now Many New Models come in the market which having voice command listeners also able to integrate with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. It is also making alarms for maintenance and other related things.

This is little costly than the other two types of thermostats but due to lots of good qualities this is one of the best in the thermostats industries

dzz8uq,1574418787,Noobie questions regarding Smart switches and Yeelight color bulbs.,"Hey guys,

I started to slowly turn my home into smart home, but I do have a few questions, especially for people living in Europe.

I got Chromecast and Google Home Mini, it all works pretty good and now I'm waiting for Yeelight LED strip which should arrive shortly. My questions are related to smart switches.

Personally I wouldn't need them since I don't have a problem controlling lights with my voice or if I have to be silent due to kid sleeping, via my phone. But since my mother-in-law is babysitting him in our apartment every day, I have to find a way to keep ""old school"" functionality, meaning she has to be able to turn the light on or off without even thinking about smart homes and technology.

Since I have a box with 4 light switches one beside the other in my wall, I would like to use  Vimar switches which should be compatible with my current box so it should fit well.

[https://www.vimar.com/en/int/catalog/product/index/code/03906](https://www.vimar.com/en/int/catalog/product/index/code/03906)

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are following:

1. If I don't have smart switch, what happens if i turned off the light via command, and someone turns the switch off and on again. Will it get power and just turn on 100% or will it remember last command and stay off regardless of the power?
2. On the switch I linked above, I'm not sure if I can put two different lights on that switch? Not sure if I can use channels A0 and A1 as a replacement for one of the current switches and B0, B1 as a replacement for another. I have 4 switches which means I should be able to replace them with 2 of these from Vimar if I got it correctly.
3. Having smart switches should hopefully help me get my smart home functionality while still enabling my in-laws to use it as they are used to, by just turning lights on and off via switch.
4. Will my Yeelight Bulbs work with Vimar switch, cause Vimar is advertised as Friends of Hue? I don't think that should mean it's not compatible with anything else, but I want to be sure.
5. Does anyone have good or bad experience with Yeelight E27 color bulbs? Just don't tell me to go with Philips Hue ecosystem cause it's the most expensive out there and I don't have that much to spend.
6. Does anyone have any experience with D Link DSP W115 smart plug? I have EU version and I can't get it to work. I have the app downloaded, it's powered on, I tried to reset it after every fail but it just won't connect to my network.

I hope this covers the basics. I could go on and on, asking about doorbells and smart locks, but that will have to wait, I just want to set up lightning for ambience and I've set up Home Mini and Chromecast for functionality. I should get my Harmony Elite tomorrow. My old Harmony died after 12 years so it was time to upgrade. I'll use Harmony Hub to control my PlayStation and my Logitech Z5500 Digital 5.1 speakers.

e01bym,1574431169,The absolutely cheapest solution for smart light switches?,"I'm a brazilian college student living in a 35m^2 apartment and I'd like to get started on Home Automation. I've recently done some minor fixes to the electrical installation here and now that everything is working fine, I want it to also work smart :)

I don't actually have that much I can do, but I'd like to have light switches that work remotely and automatically, but this kind of stuff here is way more expensive than in developed countries, so ""final products"" are a no-no. I've been doing my research on how to make multiway switching, using a relay and stuff, and so on, so that I can start approaching some actual implementations.

I don't really have experience on programming Arduino, or anything like that, but I do have a lot of software experience and some pretty decent handyman-skills (also I can go a long way with the correct tutorials).

My imaginary setup, for now, involves wiring some kind of small transmitter in every light switch, making it all converge to an Arduino, than going through the router to my phone. There, I could use tasker or some more specific app. Also I ideally would like to set something up that could be expanded to other areas if I'm able to someday.

What I'd like for you to tell me is if this is a viable ""setup"", some cheap kinds of hardware and some software (preferably free/open-source) that could be used for this and what further reading I should be doing (I've taken a peek at the wiki, but its waay, too thorough for my small project, haha).

e04u9u,1574446457,Lutron Compatibility Confusion,"Helping my folks with intelligent lighting in their new house. My dad has led lights chosen that he's set on (Lithonia WF6 wafer LED), and I'm trying to design a Lutron system that will work best. Initially I was leaning towards RA Select as he doesn't really have any interest in trying to do lots of complicated triggers and such- pretty much just lights , scenes, and some occupancy sensors here and there, but it's a big house, beyond the scope of Caseta. I have an RTI control system that I'm putting in as well for some stuff.

The issue- I looked up the LED light on the Lutron compatiblity tool and noticed that there is no RA Select family dimmers listed whatsoever. There is the Radio RA2 CL dimmer, and the standard maestro dimmer, as well as some others that are all compatible, but no specific Select ones.

I called Lutron and got some conflicting / confusing information. One guy told me that according to test data he pulled for the WF6 light, the select dimmers did not ""pass the quality standards"". I later spoke to another guy from the Radio Ra2 team, and he told me that the RadioRA2 dimmers are basically the exact same as the  Select... which has me confused as to why the Ra2 CL dimmer supposedly works but the select ones dont?

What would be so different between the Ra2 and the standard maestro dimmers and the Select? There's neutral wires in all of the receptacles in the house so I was leaning towards the Select neutral LED dimmer (rrd-6nd) or the Pro version. Evidently the pro version has not yet been tested with the WF6 light, so I have no idea if its compatible or not. Basically at this point I""m just really confused and not sure what direction I should be looking towards.

I've been able to answer these questions with googling and browsing, but I haven't seen what happens with a software or firmware update, company bankruptcy, or a company deciding to EOL a product.

Could anyone recommend a camera that does the following things:

* records video or still images when it detects motion
* can see in a dark room
* doesn't need an app to view the images or configure the camera, i.e. a plain web server would be perfect
* doesn't try to store the images on the cloud to force me to pay a subscription
* doesn't send data off to China or elsewhere

If a web server isn't possible, then recording to an SD or microSD would be great, I can just read those no problem.

Some home automation functions would be nice, but it's not a dealbreaker if they're not available. Getting an alert with a link to the video/stills would be cool, but I'm guessing that the cheaper cams won't support that. I have a Google Home mini, an Ecobee thermostat, and a Wemo smart plug. I'm not Mr Automation by any means, but if there is something that could integrate with that mess, that's great.

e0a2oq,1574468510,Interest in custom switches,"Hey all - I'm wondering if a smart wall switch exists that will do presence detection of your person (bluetooth devices?), and can be automated as such - triangulation or otherwise so when you're in a room it will turn on.  There is of course a million ways that something like that can ""go wrong"" and turn your lights on in the middle of the night, but is there such a thing that links with MQTT so you can set up rules?  I've had a thought of just paying someone to design something, but they want $10k for it overall.  

Here's my thoughts and what would make it ""worth it"" to me:
- Opensource firmware, can be customized easily and made by each person
- Triangulation let's me be lazy and saves power when I leave, assuming the IFTT type of rules keep the lights off when they should be
- Less ""automation"" work and more systematic intelligence

Currently I'm running some China KS602S' But had trouble finding 3 way swtiches that would compliment them with look and feel, and I hate having different switches all over the place.  They are all ""custom"" firmware that I wrote most of and uploaded to them.

That process, although it took a long time has been completely worth it, as I was able to set a long press that turns the light off after 10 seconds.  I realize that all of these things can be solved by pulling out a phone and tapping a button, but isn't that what we're all doing this for, to make it automated, or am I the only crazy one?

Tasmota has been interesting as well, and while I may not be smart enough to figure out the wireless flashing, I don't really care to use tasmota anyways.  At the risk of sounding paranoid, I'd rather everything talks to my own server or my phone, and I don't have time to read the tasmota code to verify what it's doing, nor do I care to set up vlans at this particular junction and blocking all internet access.  So my own firmware it is.

Moral of the story, does such a thing exist in the $50-100/switch range?  Is there a way to get a full blown home automation without spending a million bucks on lutron?  Maybe my research is all just going the wrong ways.

Appreciate all of you and your posts!

With these types of split devices, are most people setting up some routines within Alexa and others within SmartThings? How can you make a routine that would include a device that doesn’t explicitly state that it works with SmartThings?

Sorry if I’m not explaining this well, but I’m happy to answer any questions.

e0d489,1574483982,Got my 1st SmartThings Hub Today! Automations seem to have some quirks...,"So obviously new to this... but thought I had an easy first automation for my new SmartThings v3:  Have my Ring Doorbell activate on motion and turn on the front yard lights if they are not already on (they’re controlled by two Kasa switches). 

But here’s where it got strange. There seems to be a few quirks with setting up automations. Here’s what I was trying to do:

- Have the front lights on automatically each day at sunset. Then turn them off at 11pm. This was easy to do as two separate rules (and the Kasa app already does this for me).
- Next, if somebody walks up to my door in the middle of the night, and the lights are off, turn them on for 2 min and then off. I quickly learned here that I can’t have the switch as an “if condition” as well as a “then action”. This seems really strange... if I want to run the condition and flip it, then that should be up to me. Anyone know why this is?
- So next I figured to get around this, maybe there’s an order of precedence... if the lights were already doing one automation, then maybe the next won’t occur. But, I was wrong... when testing it, the lights would stay on and then promptly turn off 2 min later, even though it wasn’t 11pm yet. 
- To get around this next hurdle, I figured that since I have two switch for two sets of front yard lights, I set the if condition to check if the other set was on, and if so then don’t activate. This works... but it seems really kludgy and open to a race condition.

- Lock or unlock house doors with app, even when not home
- Open and close garage doors with app
- Front door camera with app and notifications
Some kind of motion sensor at the end of the driveway that plays a chime or something when a car turns into the driveway. 
- Ability to play music by voice command
- Adjust thermostat by voice command or app

I also want it to be budget friendly. If some of the features I listed above are super pricey or complicated, I would just go without most likely.

Admittedly I have been dinking around with smart house stuff for years, and my house is spacious and there are a few outbuildings I mess with, but I swear I’ve looked everywhere. I thought maybe it was a phantom of something I tried to install and removed, but it turns on and off reliably (according to the app) so that makes me think it’s real. And it’s not like I have tons of Z-Wave switches. I think I have 5 that I know of, and two of those are three way. I’m at a loss. I do also have some outlets and plug in switches too, but I feel those are all accounted for. 

So obviously you can’t tell me where the switch is, but I have three questions:
1. Is it possible that despite it showing up and reliably turning off and on, that it isn’t actually on the network?
2. Are there any tools, like network tools or whatever, that might help me narrow down its physical location?
3. Despite being named the default GE Wall Switch, could it be a plug, or something else? I wouldn’t have renamed it that, so it has its default name.

I also have a WEMO Dimmer for my bedroom. The WEMO has always worked via the app on my IOS devices. So I finally decided I wanted to integrate my house and get it set up so I can add more devices and eventually set up some ITTT stuff. So I bought a Google Home Mini and a Samsung SmartThings hub. I was able to get the WEMO working with the Google home, I can voice the lights on/off/dim without an issue. But when I try to get the Yale deadbolt to connect to the SmartThings hub via the app, nodda... nothing. I have searched and cannot find any info on the Yale lock and SmartThings other what is covered in the SmartThings app.

When I bring up the SmartThings App, click ADD DEVICE, scroll down and select Yale, select Door Locks, select Yale Z-Wave, it downloads something, them goes to the get started screen. I select Start, then select the hub and the room the device is in, then it gives me instructions:

1. Begin with the device locked. If needed for touchscreen modles, place your palm on the screen to wake it up.
2. enter the 4-8 digit master pin code (of which I do have) followed by the # or gear key.
3. Press 7 followed by the # or gear key.
4. Press 1 followed by the # or the gear key.
5. Wait up to 60 seconds.

When I finish the last step, the key pad waits a few seconds and then flashes and beeps as if it was a good code, not the sound it makes when you enter in a wrong code. But the hub and app do not find it, the app ends up showing me ""There was a problem connecting to the device. Try adding again.""

As for my set up, I am running a Linksys WRT2900AC, the Google Home is connected via 2.4 wifi, the SmartThings is also currently connected via 2.4, but I did have it connected to my Netgear 10/100/1000 switch. The router is located in the lower level of the house, along with the switch, the Google Home and SmartThings are both located on a level above at the entertainment system in the family room. The SmartThings hub is located about 20-25 feet from the Yale lock.

If ive left out into that will help just let me know and Ill try to provide it.

Yes the Yale has a Z-Wave cartridge installed. It was installed when we bought the house, and from what I can see it was apart of an AT&amp;T security package. I dont know if that matters or not. In all honesty I have no idea if it works because there is no way of testing it.

Anyone here use Melnor Rain Cloud?  The app and uptime has been sketchy over the last 2 years, but it generally worked. I put up with it because there was nothing else out there similar besides building my own (usually that’s what I’d do, but recently had a kid when we got it). Now their system has been offline for for over two weeks and the last update we got was that they just found what the problem was after a week of investigation. 

&gt;Although it took longer than expected to pinpoint, we have identified the cause of the problem. There is an incompatibility between our software and the third-party provider that connects your RainCloud to the cloud. Now that the cause has been identified we are exploring options to correct the issue.

So they don’t even know how to fix this problem and they’ve known the cause for over a week.

I’m in IT and the thought of one of my services being down for an hour even makes me have a mini panic attack because that would mean a lot of contingency plans had failed and something really bad was going on. Makes me think they have a highly unskilled team running this platform. Maybe they should stick to sprinklers, those are pretty good.

So to my reminder/warning: keep as much local control as you can. I started out hard core local only and eased into cloud a bit. This is why I started out that way and what is going to push me back. This thing is a paperweight now and I have to manually water my plants.

If I understand correctly, if you do bulbs only, you can turn them off and on with the physical switch, but when they're off they can't be controlled digitally because they have no power. I want both to work in tandem. 

And I'd like them to also work when the internet is down (but the router is still up to connect to locally).

I have ""Litter"" as a named socket on a [power strip](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07G179ZWS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). Google Home recognizes it, and responds to ""turn on/off litter"". 

I have ""couch lamp"" as a named [single socket](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07PZ7VVGC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). It also responds to the basic ""turn on/off"" command.

Lastly there's ""Desk"" as a named socket on a power strip. It used to be on a single socket that I renamed to ""Loose Two"". Because Google Home is confused about the name change, Desk does NOT work with voice control. 

&gt;Ok turning on desk... Sorry, Loose Two is not available

That was annoying, so I renamed the ""Desk"" socket to ""Edward"". Google now understands how to turn Edward on/off with voice commands. 

All the sockets are set up via the SmartLife app.

So my ideal set up would be to have all three of these sockets that work independently grouped into a routine so I can toggle them with a single voice command. 

To do this, I'm ensuring that all my sockets and the lights are on. I go into GH Routines, add ""popular actions"" and then go into ""adjust lights, plugs, and more"" and select Litter, Couch Lamp, and Edward to get turned off. Everything else is ""don't change""

When I test the voice command, only ""Couch Lamp"" and the single socket turn off. Desk/Edward and Litter remain on. 

&amp;#x200B;

What am I doing wrong? I would love to chalk it up to my own incompetence or lack of understanding, but there's no reason this simple routine should be this difficult to program.

2. Build a module that would serve as the water outlet. Something like Raspberry pi + water pump + water tank. The module would attach onto the vanilla dock as an extension, and refill the water tank whenever the robot is docked on to the vanilla dock.

e16jr7,1574636798,Thoughts and questions on physical buttons,"Since I moved to a new place a couple of weeks ago I'm thinking about automating my lights. My old place used smart lights and I used a cheap Amazon dash button if I didn't want to use voice commands which had worked well for me. Unfortunately my partner has on multiple occasions used the physical wall switch instead of the dash button which resulted in the smart light rebooting and throwing my automations for a loop.

In the new place I want to have my physical wall switches married to my home automation system and I've been mostly looking at Shelly 1. For the people that are not familiar with those: they are a wifi enabled relay switches. They are small enough to be mounted behind the switch plates and will make a ordinary wall switch into a smart switch. But then I thought ""then why do I even need smart lights?"" and soon after ""what if I want smart light functionality like changing color etc which can't be controlled by a single switch"". So my thought is that I don't actually need my light switches to actually switch the current for the light on and off. I only need something that will publish an mqtt message (or can be flashed with Tasmota) that can be mounted behind a switchplate. I know there are commercial light switches like the Sonoff touch but they don't integrate well with the light switch and outlet combo that we use in Switzerland.
I guess there is probably a way to get the Shelly to only send mqtt messages instead of actually cutting the power when I switch it off but that just seems like I'm spending money on functionality (the relay switch) that I don't need. Am I missing something? And if no is there a device like that?

e1a094,1574652402,Looking for advice for a basic home automation wiring for future proofing a new build house.,"We are in the process of rebuilding our house after a fire.  It will be brand new from the ground up.  Neither of us are into the whole smart home / home automation thing.  As it's not something we're really excited about, we're not looking to put too much into the system at this stage.  On the other hand, we know eventually we're going to move and now is the best time to do some future-proofing in terms of wiring.

What we are planning to add:

* Video intercom entry system to front and side door (corner lot)
* Wiring for security system to all windows and doors as well as some motion sensor here and there.
* Security camera system
* 2 ""CAT6"" lines, co-ax and phone lines to all rooms.  A few spare CAT6 in the garage for outdoor connections.
* CAT6 and power run to the shed in back corner of the lot with a 1 1/2"" conduit.
* Wiring for electric blinds in the stairwell windows
* Sound system for ambient music on the main floor.  Some ""OK"" speakers with a few zones just on the main floor (probably living room, dining room kitchen and family room)

&amp;#x200B;

* All lights will be wired with normal switches, but we might add some ""smart switches"" later on
* We are not thinking of adding a home theatre system since the ones we've looked at are beyond our budget and we're not TV people.  Also, the layout of the rooms could lead to a few good locations for the TV, which makes it hard to figure out the surround sound speaker locations.

We've talked with 2 companies that we met at a home show and they just get too pushy and don't seem to comprehend that we don't have an extra $50k to throw at this.

I'm looking for suggestion as to what are some ""must have"" items for a new build? Either just the pre-wire or the actual equipment.I'd like to hear from people who are kicking themselves that they did or didn't do X while the walls are still open.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions.

The wife has made 1 request: motorized shades.   There seems to be several options out there, from motorized out of the box, to conversion kits or add ons.  Not sure what my best choice is?

&amp;#x200B;

Some things to consider: 

Would prefer app based controls rather than remote's we'll lose, we're an apple family so we have iPhones/Siri.  

However I have not yet selected a controller such as Alexa, Google Home or Apple HomeKit so I'm not tied to any single one yet. 

Would love it if there was some central control like Harmony Hub that I could use.  IFTTT integration would be cool but not a must.

e1do7y,1574674171,newbie questions about hubs,"Hi there,

So i stumbled across home automation when I bought a Sonos One, which is Alexa enabled. I wasn't planning on setting up any home automation, but then I also purchased some smart sockets just for fun. And that's how it goes: Now I'm constantly thinking about how to make my home even smarter.

The next thing I want to get into is smart heating, but I don't really understand why I need a hub for this. In my logic, smart home works something like this:

* You have a WiFi network that covers your home
* You connect all your smart home devices to this network (bulbs, sockets, thermostats, etc.)
* You use Alexa as input method to control those devices

So, why do I need a hub for my heating system? Why can't I just exchange my thermostatic valves with smart ones, that just connect to my WiFi? 

As far as I know, a hub establishes it's own wireless network that is different from my WiFi network. So how does that work in a house with two floors and a basement? It was not easy setting up a WiFi network, do I have to make the same efforts again for a smart home network? That would just suck.

Also, choosing a hub would also mean that I am dependent on one manufacturer, right? If I chose for example a hub from tado, would I still be able to use my cheap chinese made noname sockets, or would this cause problems?

Well, quite some questions I have there, so I would be glad for some enlightenment. Thanks!",scnr83,/r/smarthome/comments/e1do7y/newbie_questions_about_hubs/,5,smarthome,4

Me and my girlfriend quite like turning lights on and off, and although I am very technical, I do not want to be blamed when things don't  do as they should, I get enough of that at work!

Currently I have a few stand lamps with Standard warm white 2700k LEDs in, all with either pull chords or inline switches on the flex.

\- Turn lights on at Dusk (without having to change times throughout the year) and at specific times(ie 7pm at all times of the year)

e1vyc8,1574762754,Best Smart ecosystem *not* using voice commands?,"I'll be moving to a new apartment soon and I'm planning on adding a few smart devices. Mainly I want to add some kind of smart thermostat so I can control my temperature, a few smart plugs with things like lamps and such plugged in, maybe some smart lightbulbs or bluetooth speakers, and also a smart deadbolt (which will be used along side a regular dumb deadbolt/door lock) etc.

I plan on doing all of this via the use of PC or smartphone apps, timers, and physical switches that aren't directly on the device (like being able to turn 2 or 3 floor lamps on and off using a wireless wall switch as well as on a timer). I just don't want to use any sort of Alexa, Google, whatever voice commands at all and will not be installing any kind of Echo Dot or similar device. Also, Apple products are a no-go. I've seen all sorts of different smart devices on Amazon like switches and plugs from GE, thermostats from Nest, and dozens of others and I'm not sure what all works together, what requires what other hardware, etc. 

I would like everything to be able to work together using either a smartphone app, physical switches, or the use of schedules/timers. Bonus points if there is some kind of programmable hub device that can run said timers and schedules instead of relying on my phone sending it commands. Or if the devices can be programmed for those schedules and then run them themselves. Basically I want to be able to control them from my phone, but not *have* to rely on my phone always being on and in service in order to work. I travel in areas that lack cell service quite a bit and a big part of it is that I want to be able to do things like lighting and temperature control on a schedule while I'm away for a few days or at work for both security and money saving reasons. Start heating my apartment an hour before I get home, turn the lights on 10 minutes before I get home or periodically while I'm away, that sort of thing. Plus I'm paranoid about locking my doors, so while I always use regular door locks and deadbolts, I would like a second I can lock from my phone in case I freak out and think I forgot.

I went and bought a Wink Hub 2 to try and bring it all together, then bam... Life got in the way. My focus got redirected due to some life issues, my kids NEVER use the bulbs in their bedrooms and game room, my grandmother lives with us so she doesn't understand technology (still uses a flip phone), etc...

Fast forward to today. Due to little to no support for the Wink hub, I'm looking to change it up. I'm reaching out here to get some direction to get started AND for future upgradability.

Everyone here uses Apple products with family sharing (iphones, ipads, my iMAC in my office, daughters Macbook Pro) and my wife has the lone Windows 10 box for her needs.

I want to see everything in homekit or another program that will allow full access and functionality, and I want it all voice integrated with Alexa.

  \-Have homekit sync with my AppleTV 4k

  \-Install Raspberry Pi 4 and run homebridge to allow homekit expandiblity and cross talk with Alexa

The space between the ceiling and the start of the glass portion of the top window is only 3"" and most battery shades I've found would cut into many inches of the glass area. Ideally, I'd have a shade that is 34.5""wide (width of metal window frame) and 82"" long (ceiling to bottom 2nd window frame). 

The blackout does not need to be completely leak-free on the edges... it just needs to cut the vast majority of the light that comes through the windows (I record videos and need to reduce natural light so I can have consistent studio lighting in the area that starts about four feet to the right of the windows.

To mitigate this, I am considering getting some ZigBee Smart Switches and a Philips Hue bridge. I checked the switches from Philips Hue, but I quite dislike the idea of using batteries on them, if possible I'd rather have them connected to the mains and forget (similar to a dumb switch).

I also want to keep maximum options with the Philips Hue App (w/ or w/o bluetooth) as well as controlling the lights when out of home, so I figured [this setup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QqNk8i-iIZKHtkTmZE_jBco6iTwDh4wY/view).

1. The heater would be need to have knobs, is that right? and those knobs needs to be set to ""High Heat"" for example then the smart plug would just turn it on at certain time.
2. What type of smart plug should I be looking into? I saw that  Xiaomi Mi Smart Plug can handle up to 1800w which is enough plus it has a built in temperature sensor which would be an extra layer of protection.
3. Any extension cord that would be enough for heaters? I know I know, not ideal but I heard that some heavy duty construction related extension cord should be enough.

Wall of text:

So let's begin — like all good stories — at the beginning. Since it's black week and the USA kindly enough imported it to Europe especially Germany I've bought a lot of stuff and will buy even more. Mostly stuff I always wanted, but always hesitated. 
One of those items was an echo dot bundle with 2 Phillips hue white bulbs ( the new ones with Bluetooth ). And I instantly fell in love.

I always tinkered with the idea of home automation but never felt it necessary or thought it would be expensive as hell. 

Well if I would have just looked at the hue options, although they are beautiful and really easy to work with, I still would have thought it was too expensive for the benefits they give.

But what I didn't thought that while maybe not necessary, they are a lot of fun. 

Like the totally **addicting** type of fun!

Right after setting up my 2 bulbs with Alexa and the hue app I looked for a deal for my mainroom/bedroom since they need gu10 bulbs and went and bought a set with 3 RGB gu10 bulbs (not the current version but the one before without BT) one light switch and one hub from hue for 80€.

After thinking about it and doing some research I will refunded them since I want a setup for the long run and don't want to invest too heavy in to the hue ecosystem. I hope that wasn't a bad move but I would probably get the same deal again if I would reorder it.

So since I'm pretty much without a hobby right now, with the only one in planning being a Plex media server which would integrate great with the home automation I would think, I want to use this as my new long term hobby. So I don't need everything working from the beginning, but I still have some long-term goals and questions to my setup.

**\1. What's with the hub**

So I've done some research and there are a lot of options.
The 2 which peek my most interest are the **SmartThings** hub and the **Home Assistant** DIY one. 

\1.\1 The SmartThings hub:

The SmartThings hub is not only recommended heavily and has a lot of functionality, it also integrates nicely with my Galaxy S9 and my **Galaxy Watch**.  Being able to use scenes from my SmartWatch without having to rely on third party tyzen support (who am I kidding with tyzen apps anyhow) or some sluggish tasker shortcuts is perfect. For anyone with a galaxy watch I don't have to tell how awefull some app support on tyzen os is.

As I see it it also supports a lot of devices from the get go.

The only downside to it is cost right now as I see it.
It's about a 100€ for the hub alone and I can't find used ones or good bundles in my region (Germany). I also don't think there will be a black Friday deal, since Samsung itself already has deals for all their devices online and it isn't much found on a lot of German markets or sites. If I'm wrong and there will be a deal (or even when there is one right now) I'll probably go ahead and buy it instantly. Just for the galaxy watch support I'm thinking about buying it without a deal.

\1.\2. Home Assistant DIY:

The benefits of this are pretty clear for me. Even though the setup time is a lot more, you regain this time in flexibility. And I don't really count the time needed to setup and tinker with the setup as a huge drawback, since I want to use this as a hobby and I kind of like to do things the hard but accomplishing way.

Since I already have a server which I will use for my media server which has 24/7 uptime, I also don't have alot of hardware to buy. The only things I would need is a single for ZigBee and I would be good to go. Just putting in another docker instance with Home Assistant and I will be good to go.

I would also not have to rely on Samsung keeping their servers up for some services even if I think they are heavily invested in to the whole SmartThings thing.

The downside is mostly app Integration and maybe initial setup, since I would like to use a solution in my mainroom pretty quickly. But I could probably use my smartphone as a controll in the meantime. Or setup my Harmony Hub since it also supports ZigBee and Bluetooth.

**\2. Switches and Bulbs:**

PSA: I have a neutral wire

So I've seen some posts and advice saying to mostly use switches instead of bulbs. And after using my two bulbs for about 3 days now I can see why. Not being able to use the normal switch without having to turn it off and on again is a huge pain in the ass. Not only because of guests being irritated, but also because of usability. 

I have a normal switch on my front door where one of my bulbs is and it's pretty much unusable right now. If I leave I have to shout at my Alexa in the next room to turn that light off or use my phone. Otherwise if I come back I won't be able to use any form of automation or smart control of that bulb since it pretty much is dead until I turn on the switch again.

A lot of automation and sensors could probably do the trick but still would be a hassle for guests and muscle memory for myself. Not everything has to be smart anyway sometimes you need a switch.

\2.\1 Do switches support color in anyway or do I have to use both bulbs and switches if I want to use color? 

I've seen some switches which don't have to be wired and they control the bulbs via the hub or direct connection. This seems like the only setup which would use both advantages. 

How is the cost on that instead of the wired ones?

For now I would probably only need this functionality for my bedroom since I would like to still use a switch but also want color for setting the mood etc.

Most of my other color bulbs I have in my mind won't even have a switch and would only be used by automation, a button, alexa or my smartphone.

Those would mostly be LED Strips or highlights at the wall for some eye candy and not my main source of light.

\2.\2 Does every bulb and switch work with my 2 options of hubs?

I would love to start with some basic bulbs and switches. Nothing out of the ordinary. When I move again next year into a bigger space I can reuse them for low attraction places or fun projects. It seems like everyone on here swears on ZigBee and zigwave but they are pretty expensive.

For me the advantages considering my current situation don't outweigh the cost. 

My current router supports up to 40 WiFi devices and my apartment is so small I have a good signal everywhere. So I don't need the mesh functionality and if I ever move into such a huge space that issues of range would occur I would probably need WiFi extenders or a mesh router anyway.

The only concern I have is hub support. Do my choice hubs support most WiFi bulbs? If not does flashing solve this issue? 

\2.\3. Flashing bulbs:

As I understand flashing bulbs is used to gain control over the device instead of having to rely on 3rd party cloud support. The devices would talk locally over the MQQT (don't remember the exact name) protocol. 

\2.\3.\1 Do my hubs support this protocol?

\2.\3.\2 Would this make bulbs usable for my hub if they weren't supported before ?

\2.\3.\3 is flashing really that hard ?
As hobbyist it seems really intriguing to go really bare bones onto the hardware.

\2.\3.\4 With flashing in mind what are the benefits of ZigBee and ZigWave not considering range or the small difference in kw/h?

\3. I also have a harmony hub to integrate my TV and reciever as well since they only support IR. It also has ZigBee. The usability of this as a main hub is not on paar with my 2 options right?

\4. What deals to look out for in the coming days? (Germany / EU)?
For now the only deals I've seen in the last 2 days were on some hue systems but nothing which put them on paar with the normal cost of cheaper bulbs etc. Can I expect more of them on Friday ?

For the Germans or Europeans what sites are you looking on to see for good deals in the coming days? 

\5. Anything I've missed?

I know that was a lot of text and for everyone reading the whole thing thank you a lot ( I know I've said a lot alot ^^) for using your time to do so. I was trying to be as thorough as my typing on the phone would allow so I could give you the best picture of my situation. Still I probably left some things out which I forgot while writing all of this or even never thought about.

If you have any other tips or tricks I should need I am open to everything. Also any questions just shoot them out I will try to answer everything to my best knowledge.

Thanks for your time and help and to all Americans have a Happy Turkey day this weekend.

e2h010,1574866098,WORKING - GOOGLE HOME WITH RING,"Alright - This is for all of you who were asking if you can use Google Homes as a notification / doorbell for your Ring doorbell. Here's the thing - for now I can only get its broadcast sound and it saying any text you set. Mine is setup as DING - Ring said ""Someone rang the front door"" - MOTION ALSO WORKS! This is NOT as good as an integration as it is with nest, but here goes.

MATERIALS REQUIRED -

Ring

Google home

Smartthings

A PC that can stay on 24/7 - doesn't have to be a good pc.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, heres how its done.

Step 1) Set up WEBCORE.

\- [https://wiki.webcore.co/](https://wiki.webcore.co/)   DO THE GitHub Installation, its easy, trust me.

Step 2) Connect your smartthings to ring

Step 3) Install NODE.JS

Step 4) If you don't want to use your own google account (this involves authorizing a project google cloud and API) then create another google account and connect it to the google home. Also another reason you might want to create a new google account is to change the name, so it can say incoming broadcast from ring, so something like that.

Step 5) Set up assistant relay - v3 (There are no video tutorials on how to do this, but its pretty straightforward. Ask me if you are stuck at any point. It will guide you through each step.

[https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-assistant-relay-v3-google-home-audio-notifications/176402](https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-assistant-relay-v3-google-home-audio-notifications/176402)

This is the direct github link - [https://github.com/greghesp/assistant-relay/releases/latest](https://github.com/greghesp/assistant-relay/releases/latest) \- install and extract [release.zip](https://release.zip)

Then open cmd , type cd then that file destination

Then run

    npm i
    npm run start

After thats done i believe it will open a browser and it'll help you continue.

DO NOT CLOSE CMD

At the last step, you might have to copy and paste a link from the cmd, but you might not. I didn't, my friend did.

If everything is correctly setup you should hear a ""BA DING! ASSISTANT RELAY IS NOW SET UP FOR \_\_\_NAME\_\_\_""

Once that is all set up, there should be an IP address in your browser and it'll give you a few options. Press sandbox. Check the Broadcast and converse. These are two things the relay checks for, it'll help us later. Leave user blank. Now type a command and pres broadcast. If it works, then you're in good shape. If not, ask me and i'll try and help you.

Step 6) Webcore.

Now that webcore is set up, go into the app, smartapps, webcore, then settings, available devices, select your ring.

Step 7) Go to co.webcore.dashboard . On the smartthings app, if you go to the webcore icon and press regester a browser it should give you a code. Enter the code and go through the first time setup.

Step 8) Create a piston. Make and IF THEN block.

BEFORE THE IF BLOCK put a define.

Define a string , Command. Value is your thing you want it to say

Define a string , User. For me it was blank.

Define a Boolean, broadcast. Value can either be true or false. Select True.

Now to the execute block. if select device - ""name of your ring""  button pressed , any button (it thinks there are more than 20 buttons, ignore that) pressed

Then THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART

Make a POST request to VALUE (THE IP ADDRESS FROM THE WEBSITE YOU SET UP , colon, port number on the website)/assistant -  it'll look something like this, \*xxx/xxx/x/xxx:3000/assistant\*       Then JSON. Select variables that you just defined. Press save.

Then save the piston and voila! Ring should work with your google home.

FOR MOTION - Its the exact same thing. Instead of create new piston crate a duplicate. Then instead of When the Ring BUTTON is pressed, make it say when motion IS.

ALSO you have to change the define, command. to say Motion

If this worked, let me know!

e2hjfj,1574868478,How to use an echo button as a trigger/toggle (but it is not pretty),"So I have had a few friends ask me if you can use echo buttons as a toggle (especially with current discount), as they can only get it te be for turning stuff on or turning stuff off.  
And since I haven't seen the solution online, I thought I would give it.  
It is not pretty, I don't like it and takes 2-3 seconds to work. This is too long for me, so I don't use it, but someone out there might want to anyway.  I use wifi lights/plugs currently, so might be easier with Zigbee/Zwave (don't have them, so can't test)  
**BUT** it is possible. Buckle in and let us go (will explain some choices at the end)  


Ok, so first off, what you will need.  Obviously your amazon stuff, including buttons.  IFTTT, SmartThings classic app (important that it is classic, also **don't** need any SmartThings devices), Conrad Connect (kind of a replacement for Stringify).  
What you do is create a virtual switch in the SmartThings app (sure there are ""how-to"" out there).  
this you can now import into the Alexa app as a switch.  
Then you link the echo button to trigger the virtual switch.  
You then need to set up an IFTTT that triggers on the virtual SmartThings switch turning on, and it sends a webhooks to Conrad-connect.  
in Conrad connect you a project that does 2 things. turns the virtual switch back off, and toggles the light/plug (conrad connect has toggle log built-in).  
And there you go. an echo button that acts as a toggle.....with about 3secs delay.  


So why did I do some of the things?  
Alexa cant use a skill, etc as an action, so we have to set something that can be externally monitored (in this case the virtual switch). I went for the virtual switch as I didn't have spare plugs/power points to use for as a trigger, so needed to be virtual. Might save time in the delay by using an actual plug (no talking to SmartThings ).C  
Conrad connect can connect to SmartThings , but for some reason, buttons are not supported as sensors (action), maybe soon.  So had to use the IFTTT.  
And all the layers means lots of communication, which causes the delay.  
So things might change, that will enable some steps to be cut out, but right now this is what I am stuck with. And as mentioned, not good enough for me. but maybe it will help someone.

I've got a Google Home, three GH Minis, a Chromecast and a Chromecast audio. I've also got a few cheap smart plugs.

I've moved to a bigger place now and feel like branching out a bit. I'm also in the situation where I'm becoming more and more pissed off with Google. Commands not being recognised; routines half done; Google randomly changing behaviour or completely removing products/support. The kicker for me was when they discontinued the Chromecast audio.

So I'm wondering if I can hand roll my own solution.

Would it be possible, with a collection of Raspberry Pis; connected mics and speakers; open-source libraries and a bit of know-how (I'm a software developer) to achieve a similar kind of setup?

The one thing I can see being a struggle is playing Spotify in the whole house. There's a Spotify client API that can handle playback controls, but I can see it being difficult to sync playback across multiple devices.

I have some outdoor up/down lights around my home which I wanted to enhance with smart bulbs.

However, I’ve installed the two bulbs at the front of the house, and the bottom bulb keeps losing connection.  I’m assuming this will be linked to the metal surround of the up/down light - but why would this be only affecting the bottom light and not the top.

So my sister and her husband are getting ready to close on a house (2000sqft, 3 level townhouse) and we want to get as much work done as possible on it before really moving in. As I (26M Software Engineer) am the de facto tech support of the family, I have been asked to see if I can think of anything that we might want to do, including smarthome features. I've introduced the ideas of lighting, HVAC, window shades, locks, and a security system - all to very interested ears.

I'm not exactly new to smarthome tech as I've got some of my own stuff (Nest, Hue, Echo, Roborock). That said, I haven't really been keeping up with smarthome tech for the past year or two, doing research on all of the different products/compatibility/integration would take a lot of time, and I don't want to be stuck as tech support for someone halfway across the country if I don't have to. 

So here we are! I've begun looking into a few different companies (Control4 &amp; ELAN) but I figured you all might have some pointers to get me going in the right direction. Ideally, I would rather not have a subscription service and then just schedule tech support as needed (though I sense that's probably not very feasible for what I want). I do want to have the ability to integrate new technologies as they come out/budget allows/priorities change and have an all-in-one OS/app for control. Hopefully, it should be easy enough for a non-techy person to use.

Any thoughts or suggestions for me regarding companies/contractors to look at?

Questions/concerns I ought to be thinking about?

Features I might want to look at or avoid?

e2q0j7,1574902450,Are there any good wifi remote switches?,"So I'm no expert or electrician, but I'm pretty sure one of my two travel wires on my 3-way switch is broken. Before with the dumb switches, the light only works in one of the 4 positions, line box on load box on, and not in the off/off position.

I got the Leviton wifi dimmer (DH6HD) + remote (DD00R). The confusing part is that the written instruction have one setup (with the remote on the line box), while the youtube videos have a completely different setup (with the remote on the load box). I tried all four wiring combinations of the two setups and two travel wires.

In the first setup, no combination ever turned on the light, and only one of the two combinations turned on both devices.

In the second setup, one of the two combination of travel wires finally turned on the light, but the remote is just flashing endlessly. I'm assuming it's just failing to communicate with the main switch.

I do wish I had tools to test the connection between the wires, but at this point I'm fairly sure one of the two travels is broken. So now I'm wondering if there's any clever wiring technique to make this work, or a wifi remote I can use to match the state of the main wifi switch. I have an extra DW6HD, is there any way I can wire it and have it just get power and connect to wifi, then mirror the state of the other switch?

I'm comfortable coding and messing around with microcontrollers.

e2yzme,1574952670,"Getting started: 3-state lights, dimmable, physical AND digital control, works without internet","Basically title is what I need. My basement lights are controlled by two switches. I want to have two smart switches instead, I want the lights to be dimmable, and I want the physical and digital control to work together in concert, even when the internet is down (but LAN is up).

I'm starting to thing Philips Hue is the best way to go... I can get a starter kit with 4 white bulbs and the hub for $90 + tax (CAD) right now. Then I'd need two switches, about another $50 CAD. I'd probably 3D print a cover to go over my original switches and stick the hue ones over top. 

It's a high buy-in price, but it seems very slick. Does anyone have any alternative recommendations that meets all of those requirements? The TP-Link HS200's almost do, but aren't dimmable. And all of the dimmable smart switches I can find seem to start getting into the same price range as the hue starter kit + switches. 

I'm drowning in options here and getting analysis paralysis. Is this the best way to go?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: After thinking about it some more, I realized I do have one more requirement: I'd like to be able to use RGB bulbs. Knowing that, I think Philips Hue is the main way to go. Otherwise, I'd still have to get smart bulbs &amp; separate smart switches, and it occurred to me that using dimmers on a 3-state switch could be weird, I'm not sure that even works? So it seems like it makes the most sense to go with Hue since the light's state will all be stored in one place, and basically just toggled from the switches. 

THAT SAID, the main reason I care about RGB bulbs is this is going in my home theater, and the ambiance settings would be sweet. When it comes to the rest of my house, getting a separate hub that supports zigbee and/or zwave, and using smart switches with that, then controlling both hubs with Home Assistant or something, is definitely on the table.",I_Love_That_Pizza,/r/homeautomation/comments/e2yzme/getting_started_3state_lights_dimmable_physical/,2,homeautomation,9

There is one porch light on the entryway shared by both apartments, and it is controlled by a wired switch inside one of the apartments. I’d love to find a way to allow for residents in either apartment to be able to operate the porch light without having to add additional wiring or another fixture. 

I have to believe that with the wide variety of smart technologies available—fixtures, bulbs, switches, hubs, apps—there is an elegant solution to this problem. Ideally, either apartment will be able to turn the light on, but won’t be able to turn it off if the other still needs it on (which may not otherwise be communicated.)

Existing technology: The house has wi-fi and both apartments have (older) Nest thermostats. There is no general smart home system in place; I’m not particularly motivated to build one but would consider it if the benefits are there. I will not use voice control systems such as Alexa.

e30rut,1574960665,Running LEDs under my bed for a sexy light show... but a buzzing power supply is ruining my life. Please help.,"Hey there!

I'm having an issue with some RGB LED lights I ran around my bed.

The power supply keeps making a buzzing noise. I'm 21, so my hearing is still fairly decent and it's absolutely driving me insane. The more I dim the lights, the quieter the buzzing gets, so I have a feeling I need a stronger power supply... maybe?

I have tried a 12V 3A Power Supply, a 12V 5A Power supply, and a 12V 6A power supply. All of which have the buzzing.

They are 12V LEDs (RGB, not the ones with the W [I'm assuming the W means white])

I tried to compile everything together so it would be super easy to understand my setup.

Can someone point me in the right direction here? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

First I'll list what I'm looking for in a smart switch solution so you know where I'm coming from.

I need it to not be wi-fi, and to have options for single switch, single switch with dimmer, and 3-way with or without dimmer. The 3-way ones also have to be able to work with dumb switches in the same circuit because that will save me buying an extra 5 switches.

What I've tried: TP-Link Kasa switches. They're...ok. I really like the aesthetics with a dim light on when the switch is off. However, they don't have a 3-dimmer, they require a smart switch in every position in a 3-way setup, and they're wi-fi and I don't need an extra 10-20 wi-fi clients connected just to run my lights.

I'd prefer a Z-Wave or Zigbee solution so I can just get a SmartThings hub and then do some other stuff with it as well, but from poking around on Amazon only the Insteon switches seem to definitely meet my needs based on listed specs and reviews. However, the reviews on the hub say it's total garbage...

We're just closing on a house next week and I've been getting ready to automate everything. There's a deal on Inovelli switches/bulbs right now and I want to go all in, but I want to make sure of some stuff:  
  
1. How easy is doing electrical in terms of hooking these things up? What if the wires aren't labeled?  
2. My home was built in 2007 - How likely is it that neutrals are present?  
3. Since the Inovelli switches don't require neutrals, if there are neutrals present in the wall, do I just leave 'em hanging instead of plugging them in?  
4. Unfortunately my entire new house uses the standard toggle style switches which means I'll need to buy entirely new plates. Many of them are 3-4 gang plates. Is the sizing for all of these switches standardized? Will I easily be able to remove the old switches, insert any switch, and then buy any standard rocker-style plate? Will I need to cut into drywall?  
5. There are ceiling fans in a few of the rooms. Any harm in using a dimmer switch for those? What about the gas fireplace (uses a standard switch)? Am I better off just buying non-dimmer switches?  
6. I've read that there are places that may not have enough power for the switches, like bathrooms with multiple vanity lights. How common is this? How do I test this beforehand?  
  
Also, what switches would you guys actually recommend? Seems like these Inovelli switches are the ones I see people talk about most, but they're a bit pricier than others.",ChromakeyDreamcoat,/r/homeautomation/comments/e36fou/new_to_homeanything_few_questions_about_smart/,3,homeautomation,13

This seems like something that would be easy enough to solve, but I’m stumped...

I have three Kasa Smart Plugs in my place, all connected to lamps. I’m looking for a switch similar to Philips’ Hue Dimmer product which is battery powered, doesn’t need to be installed in a wall with a neutral wire, and can be programmed to remember five different scenes. 

Kasa’s switch products all have to be wired in to replace a previous paddle switch, which I don’t want because I’m trying to control smart plugs, not a light.

e3e58s,1575030516,UE Boom plugin for Homebridge,"Everyone, I made a Homebridge plugin for UE Boom speakers.

I was able to sniff the Bluetooth data from the official UE Boom app by using Xcode's PacketLogger. Turning off the speaker is not yet possible as it requires `rfcomm` and I've been having some issues with it. As soon as I have time I'll work on it.

You can find the package at: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-ueboom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-ueboom)

You can contribute at: [https://github.com/alessandroaime/homebridge-ueboom](https://github.com/alessandroaime/homebridge-ueboom)

**Short explanation of how it works**

Since more than one person asked me how this works and that the speaker doesn't connect to the Pi after being turned on, I thought I could spend a couple of words about.

`gatttool -i hci0 -b $MAC_ADDRESS --char-write-req -a 0x0003 -n 4098ADA356C401`

This is the command that does the whole work, everything else in the code is the home bridge plugin boilerplate. The `gatttool` command turns the speaker on but doesn’t associate the speaker with the Pi. The speaker connects to the latest paired device (in my case my iPhone).

I don't know the exact specifications so this is a pure, but I think very accurate, speculation: the speaker itself has the usual Bluetooth 4.0 module that allows to stream music, in addition to that there's also a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) module that for its own nature is always on and allows to turn the speaker on and off remotely (within range).

I’ve got a section in my kitchen with my coffee maker, microwave and toaster. They are all currently plugged into a protected power bar l but I’m looking to control it with either a smart plug or outlet or power bar so that they aren’t always drawing power.  Ideally it needs to be compatible with smart things. 

So far I’ve looked at the TP Link Kasa power bar and also the zooz Zen but kinda pricy for me. 
 I’m open to suggestions if there are cheaper alternatives.  Or maybe I don’t need a smart power bar at all and can get away with a smart plug plugged into it or even just a smart outlet?

e3hduv,1575047006,Smart Home noob: Help/Advice needed,"Recently decided to smarten up my home, it seems to be extra difficult because I’m using iOS devices and my partner is using an android one.

So far we have:

Hardware:

Fire TV,
Samsung Smart TV,
Xiaomi Dafang Camera,
Doorbell Camera (some cheap one but runs from an app called “iCSee Pro”),
5 Philips Hue Bulbs w/ bridge,
2 Smart Plugs (again some cheap ones but these run on eFamily).

Software:
Alexa,
Hue (and a few third party hue apps, recommendations welcome?),
HomeKit,
SmartThings,
eFamily,
IFTTT,
Shortcuts,
Xiaomi Home,
iCSee Pro,
Ring.


I have also just bought a Ring Doorbell and pre-ordered their indoor cam to replace the Dafang (to be used mostly to monitor the dog when left alone).
I am contemplating and very willing to buying an Apple TV and/or HomePod.

Biggest issues at the moment:
I want the Fire TV to show the cameras (including the Echo Show), this doesn’t seem to be possible
Alexa keeps adding multiples of all my Hue bulbs
Multiple accounts don’t seem to work well on some of these. I’ve set up a shared email address so my partner and I can both use one. Are there any issues with doing this? Any way to add a third “adult” account to Alexa?
Can the Echo Show be used to show the cheap cameras?

Its a commercial garage door, so nothing like a home system and doesn't have the typical no doorbell style, but instead has three buttons, one up, one down, one stop.  The buttons are hardwired to the motor and I measured 24v AC across the contacts.

e3qag2,1575086173,Automating MTH Trains,"I'm not sure if this a post for homeautomation, programming, whatisthisthing, or somewhere else, but here it goes. 

I finally purchased a train set for my Christmas tree this year. I could have  purchased an easier solution, but for a variety of reasons I wanted a train made my MTH - an O guage train with their DCS system. This train system has a box called a ""DCS Explorer"" that interacts with the train on the track - controlling the trains movements, sounds, etc -  and the box is controlled via a mobile app. I was hoping it would be a REST API and easy to decode but no such luck.

The app is called Wi-Fi DCS in the app store.

I did some packet captures between the app and my phone. It looks like the app starts up a telnet session to the DCS explorer on a strange port (37357).

It sends a variety of commands, but I think if I can get the initial handshake between the app and the DCS explorer down I can build some automation for the train. 

&amp;#x200B;

The initial handshake has the app send 'H5\\r\\n' to the explorer

The explorer returns 'H5 (some HEX looking code) okay'

The app then sends 'H6 (some other HEX looking code)'

Both HEX codes change each time the app handshakes with the explorer.

If I open a telnet session to the exporer and send H5\\r\\n I do get the 'H5 (some HEX code) okay' response, so I'm pretty confident that if I can figure out how the app is deriving the code it sends back to the explorer I can take it from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've attached a couple examples. Any have any ideas what these codes are? I thought maybe HEX encoded decimals or dates but nothing seems to be right.

Assuming what I am saying is accurate, can you help suggest a reasonably priced unit (perhaps with black fridy cyber monday deals) to meet this need?

It would be okay if it was only recording when there's movement, but there's a night shift and day shift so it'd see movement pretty much the whole time anyway.

e41zz7,1575142360,Went crazy on black Friday. Mistake?,"My wife and I have google pixels and one goggle home mini.  So far just some smart lights and switches, and a security cam.

Yesterday I bought a nest hub, nest thermostat and a smart Lock.   I'm new to home automation but was really excited to make my home ""smart"".

Was Google home the wrong way to go?  It's so hard to find an answer to this.  I'm just reading about ifft and all the things it can do.  

Would an Alexa have been a better choice?

I read you can't group devices in seperate rooms and Google home needs voice commands to do most things.   If it seems I'm driving home there isn't a way for the thermostat to know?  Or use the motion sensor to detect someone's in the home? 

Home automation and some security are my desires.  I don't really like talking to the Google home if I don't have to.

However... I found a deal this morning I couldn’t pass up on. Nest WiFi kit (router and point), Nest Hub Max, Nest Thermostat E + Heat Link &amp; a Nest Mini for £310. Yes... £310...

To clarify I just got into the Nest/Google Home Smarthome after years of being with Amazon. 

I’ve already got 3 Nest Hubs, so the Nest Hub Max will go nicely in my kitchen!

This is where I’m questioning if I should go with the Nest E over Tado. How much of a difference does the TRVs make? I wouldn’t be surprised if Google release some TRVs in 2020. I quite like the look of the Nest E over the Tado! Also not having a subscription for geofencing like Tado has would be nice.

On the back of the manual it shows the programming code, and two user codes (user code A and user code B). All default straight from the box. 

I then added a user code for myself for the lock. So all good up to this point. My code works but then the original default codes from the back of the manual also still work. 

My question is: 
Should I delete the default user codes manually? Or were they supposed to be deleted automatically when I added my own code and maybe I didnt do it right? 

- I guess my issue with it is if someone finds the manual then they would know the default code to get in or if the default user codes are somehow tied to the serial number then maybe a criminal could figure it out or if all the default user codes are the same or a sequence of the same.

Hive thermostats are provided by the builder, but from research I need some sort of bridge to actually connect it to an app?

Things I want eventually are; 

• Connected heating 

• Colour changing lighting 

• Motorised blinds 

• Doorbell with 2 way communication 

• Music streaming (Probably Alexa but flexible) 

• A couple of sockets to turn on/off as needed
