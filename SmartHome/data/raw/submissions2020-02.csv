ewxpje,1580516288,Best option for white LED strips with color temperature adjustment that can integrate with Home Assistant?,"To be honest I don't really care about RGB. I have a few already and 99% of the time they're just white except for holidays.

ewzl8v,1580525172,Advice for someone just starting out?,"Hiya. I've been bitten by the smart home bug, it started out simple. Just a few lights on timers. Next it was hue white bulbs in the bedroom... then an alexa to give us voice options. 

Now we have hue lights in nearly every room (some are even color!), wifi smart plugs have replaced my timers, I have wyze sensors and cameras inside to help run routines and keep an eye on the house demons while we are out. Sheesh, I'm researching robot vacuums! This is fun! It's past time to step it up a bit. I need a hub. 

I've been lurking and reading and trying to figure out which one would be best. I'm probably not up to setting up Home Assistant on a Pi, at least not yet. It's probably going to be either the Smart Things or Hubitat. I'm leaning towards Hubitat as it's local..but I have a bunch of questions.   

 Has anyone used both of these hubs personally? Any advice here?

I don't want a ton of devices plugged into my router, these just replace the hue bridge, right? Would one even replace the Arlo bridge?

I rent and cannot install anything. Do they actually make smart plugs that are safe to use with space heaters or AC units? Speaking of.... are there any unsafe hub-controlled smart plugs I should avoid? 

Anyone have a favorite home security set up they'd like to share? Non-wired and self monitored is fine.  I currently have Wyze sensors set up to trigger lights/cameras and such, wouldn't mind a bit more though. 

One of the things I would love would be to have our home arm and disarm itself or even have a personalized welcome based on who was entering. Is this possible?  I had an idea that something like Tile could be used like this. If a person's Tile was home then the house wouldn't be armed. If all tiles were gone, house is armed. If a known tile was walking in the front door then the house gives them the right greeting. Or is that too complex?

A retailer here does one, however it only allows you to turn the light on or off, ideally I'd want to be able to adjust the motion sensitivity, or have it send a prompt if the light was turned on (so for example then I can say ""if the sensor light turns on, then switcht these other two lights on as well).

ex1ctr,1580534333,All smart devices useless after power outage??,"THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED...see edit

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a whole lotta fun!  Had a power outage for about 1-2 seconds today afterwards all the smart devices were boned.  I figured whatever this sucks but i'll just reconfigure, no dice everything I try to reconnect just says installation failed.  I have reset every single device per instructions get the exact blinking lights it says i'm looking for but continues to fail every config regardless.  I figured well maybe it's wigging out on the access point, so I setup another access point and still same issue.

After trying 3 smart plugs, 2 smart lights, and a smart surge protector all failing installation I thought to myself hey I have a couple more smart plugs that have never been used I'll try that.  Bingo works perfectly, tried it on both access points works great no issues.  So here I stand every single smart device that was connected during the power outage is seemingly fubared and every smart device that has never been used works perfectly.  Did a power flicker kill every single smart device in the house or am I missing something here?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I originally attempted unplugging one of the units for several min and retesting to no avail.  Out of frustration I removed all the smart devices and set them aside to test later.  After I cooled off I retested the units and all are configuring correctly.  It seems they needed to sit unpowered for some unknown period of time.  I am fairly sure I waited at least 60 seconds before reconnecting the unit I tested earlier but I can't be sure.",TheRainbowPilot,/r/smarthome/comments/ex1ctr/all_smart_devices_useless_after_power_outage/,12,smarthome,4

ex4n9v,1580555282,Remote control radiator valves,"Hi,
I am in the middle of renovating my apartment including the piping. I am installing eight new radiators. One is electric and seven are connected to the building's communal hot water central heating system. Pipe is 15mm.

I have bought new cast iron radiators with thermostatic radiator valves (TRV) valves. 

I would like to add a second valve to each radiator to allow me to switch flow on and off by app to each radiator.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a suitable valve? What is the easiest, most future proof way of doing this?

Ideally the remote valve would be as discrete as possible.
It also doesn't necessarily need to be smart (display etc).
I am envisaging it only having an on/off role. 

Also, just to clarify, I don't have an individual boiler. It is a building wide communal system so I can only reduce flow to my radiators. Also I would rather use my own RSVs that are more decorative, rather than a Netatmo etc, and simply have a second remote operated valve to turn the system flow on or off.

I'll list all items with the link, price, and a quick review (after 3 months of use)

 

* [Schlage Sense™](https://www.schlage.com/en/home/smart-locks/sense.html):  + [Schlage Lock Front Entry Handle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00COR0U7A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

The lock is high quality, works everytime with either HomeKit app or touchscreen. It has great add-on features like automatic lock after certain seconds. The main reason why I went with Schlage is because it was the only smart lock that has a key. You can't trust technology too much. I had to get the entry handle of the same design as well. They both look amazing.

**Price : $170 for the lock and $80 for the handle.**

* [Aqara Light Switches](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32878073541.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000023.9.156ed870OlGixg) \+ [Aqara hub](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32912322984.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.12.44196a9cHwZlEg&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_6_10065_10130_10068_10890_10547_319_10546_317_10548_10545_10696_453_10084_454_10083_10618_10307_537_536_10902_10059_10884_10887_321_322_10103,searchweb201603_58,ppcSwitch_0&amp;algo_expid=2a598268-7aa9-408c-b87b-b90715cfa57a-1&amp;algo_pvid=2a598268-7aa9-408c-b87b-b90715cfa57a&amp;transAbTest=ae803_5): 

While Aqara is not the best in the market, they required no neutral wiring and the reviews were great. They are simple on that wall and have a really nice touch to them and are easily installed. Among all other devices, they were the ones that show the ""not responding"" error SOMETIMES, whenever they do, I just re-check after a couple of minutes to find them back online. It doesn't bother me much. I would have loved to have one with a dimming feature. Other than that, they are functioning as they should. I also got the wireless switch that I got on my bed table. I have it automated to close the shades and turn the lights off when I go to bed, and open the shades when I wake up in the morning ( single tap, double taps)

**Price for 3 switches, the wireless switch, and the hub: $160** 

&amp;#x200B;

* [SomaShades and Soma Connect](https://www.somasmarthome.com/collections/soma)

These are the most expensive of the entire list. I got 3. Two for my bedroom and one for my living room. When you install them, always make sure that the chains are as tight as possible. Otherwise you'll notice with time that they over-close or half open. The chains must be tight as the device relies on calculating the ""dots"". They take time for opening and closing which people hate but I really like. It gives my eyes a bit of light doses in the morning to wake me up gradually. Make sure that solar panel that charges the device are installed on the most sunny angle. One of my windows is on the eastern side of the tower the sun only touches the far angle of the window. I had to re-attach the solar panel on that angle to get it charging. It's worth saying that when the panel was attached where there was no sun, it had 4% which kept the shades working for 4 days. (1% per day? :D)

**Price for 3 shades and the hub: $533**

&amp;#x200B;

* [Sensibo](https://sensibo.com) Smart A/C: 

It is hot where I live so telling Siri to turn the A/C on 15 minutes before I get out of work makes the afternoon nap so special. Easily installed, works perfectly everytime. 

**Price for 2: $250**

&amp;#x200B;

* [Fibaro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M2YTQ13/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) Sensor and motion detector: 

Just a fancy eye-blinking ball to keep at the living room. Didn't find much use for it, really.

**Price: $69**

&amp;#x200B;

* [SwitchBots](https://www.switch-bot.com) 

I got these for my Nespresso machine. I usually like to press the coffee button twice to get everything out of the coffee capsule. Asking Siri to ""make coffee"" for a press then saying ""make it a double-shot"" for Siri to simply press the Botton again always impresses my friends :) 

**Price for 2 Bots and the hub: $140**

&amp;#x200B;

At last, I needed a brain to connect all these fancy tech, I conclude my list with the beast version of Siri: 

* [HomePod](https://www.apple.com/homepod/)

I think it has some sort of deep learning. At first it was horrible always asking "" Who is this"" whenever I give her any order. Now it literally obeys commends while I'm in bed and the HomePod is at the far end of the living room. (8.5 meters away). It's great not only for connecting my smart devices, but for shouting regular Siri tasks like reminders, etc.

**Price:$400**

&amp;#x200B;

**The overview of this experience is amazing, I believe that home automation is the earliest version of the Internet Of Things that will conquer the world when the fourth industrial revolution kicks in.**

[Here is the manual for the controller](https://1drv.ms/b/s!As_YagEFqp5xoZlUO7nbOUBLpmn5aQ?e=VA5D8t) (English version starts at page 18)

I have checked the behaviour of the old system and it seems as if pressing one of the buttons (Up) activates the Start function (close/open depending on current state). I could wire up my relay to simulate a button press. However that would require some soldering and I would prefer to do this project without actually modifying (/soldering anything to) the original gate controller.

If you read the manual on page 28 at the top it says something about the possibility of controlling the gate with external devices, but I'm yet to figure out if it's some special serial connector for their controlling devices or just two connectors that can be connected to each other for the gate to open. On page 34 it shows the connectors and their function and based on that I think simply connecting pin 3 with 5 would trigger the opening/closing of the gate.

But still I would like to ask other people here of what they think, because I really would prefer not to fry this pcb.

ex9n0w,1580578718,Stelpro Maestro Baseboard Heater Smart Thermostat Review,"I've seen some discussion on here about smart thermostats for baseboard heaters, and while most on here seem to recommend the Mysa, its not usable in 2 wire 240 V setups (my situation).  I got a Stelpro Maestro controller and a few satellite thermostats, and I figured I could give a review for anyone who couldn't use the Mysa or wanted to try something else.

The setup is very easy - wiring with 2 wires is pretty simple, and connecting the satellite thermostats to the controller was as simple as clicking a few buttons in the app and on the thermostats.  

Temperature control with the maestros is a bit frustrating.  The thermostats don't display the actual ambient temperature they measure. There's some algorithm in them that uses the measured temp to estimate the temperature at the center of the room they're in, and then the heaters adjust to that estimated temp.  Its actually in the FAQs, I just missed it (https://www.stelpro.com/en-US/faq-maestro). I tried contacting stelpro to see if that feature could be turned off, but was told no.  For me, the estimated temp is generally a few degrees above the actual (measured with a thermometer), so while I can adjust around it, its just frustrating that I paid for a device to tell me the wrong temp.  

The app is intuitive enough, grouping thermostats to control heating zones is easy, and programming a schedule using those zones is also very straightforward.  The geofencing feature is pretty hit or miss, and it misses often enough that I end up just checking the app every day to make sure the temperatures drop when I go to work.  I think my favorite part of having the maestro is the energy tracking feature.  My house is a tri-level with a pretty open concept.  I generally don't go to the downstairs, so I'd been heating just the main floor I live on and letting that heat rise to the upstairs bedrooms, with some expensive energy bills from the main floor heaters running all of the time.  Using the thermostats together I've been playing around with the best mix of house temperature settings to minimize daily energy usage.  

Overall, I think I've seen better reviews for the Mysas, so if you have the wiring for them I'd go that route, but the Maestro is capable enough despite the temperature accuracy problems.",PackersBuffaloes777,/r/homeautomation/comments/ex9n0w/stelpro_maestro_baseboard_heater_smart_thermostat/,23,homeautomation,14

I went to a local retailed Blinds To Go (in US) and they have motorized blinds with batteries and motor built into the roller. A wand with 2 buttons (up and down) connect to the blinds via Micro USB. The wand has a Micro USB input as well for charging the battery. I was informed that though the blinds are motorized, they aren't smart and can't be controlled remotely. 

Well, I figured, it's Micro USB, probably a serial port device. I was going to hook up the wand to my computer, find the device and read the commands it sends when a button is pressed. Then I was going to use NodeMCU or a Raspberry Pi to hook up to the blinds and control them remotely. However, when I hooked up the wand to the computer, no new device showed up (lsusb in Linux). Also, no tty-related messages in dmesg. 

Has anyone ever encountered these kind of blinds? My next step probably will be to hook it up to a micro USB breakout board and read the pins. Maybe it just uses the micro usb for the connector style, and just has 5V and GND for power, and the buttons simply short D- / D+ to 5V. I was hoping to get some advice before I go down this path.

-Have lights adjust temperature based on time of day
-Have same lights be dimmable at the light switch

Constraints
-Wife is picky about switches and wants them to look and operate as close to 'normal' rocker switches as possible (ex: Caseta switches are a hard no. TP-link is ok). I know this is a pretty vague requirement.
-Wife never wants to open an app to turn on lights/dim lights

I have a pool light with a breaker in my pool sub panel and a switch inside my house. 

The switch in my house has a single 3-wire cable (black * 2 and ground). 

The sub panel has a cable coming into the panel through the wall in the middle of the box (strange if you ask me). That cable has black, white, and ground. Both of these (black and white) seem to be neutral because the black is wired to the white/neutral of the low transformer for the light and the white is wired to the circuit in the load neutral connection. The hot wire from the breaker connects to the blue (14v) source cable on the transformer.

There are two black cables coming out of the transformer (along with ground), and they are connected to black and red wires going to the light. 

I cannot see the wiring at the light and I am not 100% sure how the switch, light, and cable coming into the panel from the wall are laid out. 

I want to put a Z-Wave switch in this box because there is no neutral at the switch in the house (and the panel door says not to use a dimmer which is the only way to power a switch without a neutral wire). 

Questions:

* Does the wiring look normal (perhaps other than the cable coming through the wall)?
* What is the most likely wiring layout between the panel, light, and switch (e.g. cables from panel wall and switch both go directly to the light and the switch is put in line on the neutral wire)?
* Please help me understand why there are two black wires coming out of the transformer instead of one (hot). I understand line and load for a switch but in this case it seems like both are line.
* How would you wire a smart switch in the panel? Ground to a bar in the panel, neutral to white from the transformer, line black from the breaker and load blue into the transformer? 
* Can I just hard-wire the wires in the switch box inside the house, or do I need to do something (is it possible with existing wiring) to turn this into a 3-way?

I'm starting my foray into home custom RGBW lighting with a large display case lighting project. I have 4 Ikea Detolf displays around my house that I want to move together side by side and light up. A friend gifted me two [Home Depot RGBW](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/78e69c2d-74ec-4c12-82de-4dea86a10040/svn/white-commercial-electric-strip-lights-17898-64_1000.jpg) that I would like to mount under each shelf, however the connectors they are packaged with are too long and there are not enough of them.
 
I want to buy some wire and connectors to solder and customize, but I am not sure where to start or what to do. I noticed that the strips come pre-made with [male/female pins](https://imgur.com/a/QE07J3N) on either side but online I see most kits have snap on connectors/open solder points. What i would like to do is buy some 12mm 5 pin cable and some male/female pin heads and make the extensions between each self running up the length of each cabinet [like so](https://imgur.com/yhwnOb8)

Can anyone give me some tips on what I should by/ how you would route this? Further more, I was wondering about how I should route each cabinet. Right now my plane is for 4 of them to be side by side and bolted to each other and the wall. Since each one has 4 shelves, I was wondering if it would be better to run 4 set of 4 strips in a series in parallel to each cabinet or route all 16 strips in a series going up and down through each cabinet?

Either way I am pretty sure I need to buy new power adapter and IR control. The strip package says it powers up to 6 strips and is 12v 1A. Since I would want 16 powered would I want to get a 12v 3.5 amp adapter and similar IR controller as the output is rated 1amp for the one in they came with?

Thanks for any help/advice you can give me. I will try to answer any questions and give more info if needed.

**TL:DR**
I want to route 16 RGBW LED strips along 4 detolf shelves for display case lighting. The strips I have have female/male pin connectors rather than bare copper for soldering.

eyh2ve,1580775980,Why is there no middle ground?,"Maybe I'm just missing something fundamental here, but I doubt it. Here's two examples of what I'm talking about:

Automation 1 - blink my lights when I get an email

IFTTT will do this, integrating with Hue and gmail. however, it blinks ALL of the lights, literally 12 times, in bright white only. No option to say if I get an email, blink *these* lights *this* color *this* amount of times. If I want to use this, I need to get a hub. Why? the first option is unusable. someone in my bathroom doesn't need a seizure if I want to know I have an email. My porch light doesn't need to inform my neighbors of email either.

Automation 2 - turn on the backyard lights when I open the front door

IFTTT will do this, integrating august with ewelink. however, it will only do one switch at a time, and you can specify person unlocking the door, but not the time. I don't need the lights to turn on every time I open the door, only when it is dark. there's also no way to have them turn off once autolocked. Why can't the flow be if front door is unlocked by user after *this* time, turn on *this* switch and *this* switch. If front door autolocks, turn off *this* switch and *this* switch.

these seem like..very minor alterations. the variables exist in the API. I just don't want to code everything. why is everything half assed? you can get an app to do most of what you want, but if you want anything that make the automation useful, you need to install a hub and fuck with APIs.",Nebakanezzer,/r/homeautomation/comments/eyh2ve/why_is_there_no_middle_ground/,0,homeautomation,15

I google a lot in my attempt to find an open source project that could help me but english isn´t my native language so I have no idea which are the best keywords for this search.

I own a ZACO V5S Pro vacuum robot that uses the random priciple to vacuum. It just folows random paths until I turn it off or it\`s battery drains and it goes back to it´s charging port. A long time ago I saw a post on the internet of a guy who programmed his robot to do a bunch of stuff so I wondered myself if there aren´t any open source projects that have an app or something similar so that you can control your robot and also change his behaviour so that it doesn´t just randomly work anymore but follows a map and vacuums every square cm of my home.

I have found open source projects to build your own from scratch but I don´t need that and they all use the random principle so their code isn´t usefull either.

I know it is much to ask because programming an app and an arduino(probably) to do all this stuff takes a lot of time and effort but maybe there is someone out there who took the time and you guys can help me find them.

eyqdym,1580824575,Aqara Sensors on Smartthings,"Hello!

I have 6 Aqara sensors connected to my ST Hub - all through routers (Anchor Vetaar outlets which I added as generic Zigbee switches - they claim to be Zigbee 3.0 and show up as routers on ST). 4 of my sensors are temperature sensors and 2 are contact sensors. I used bspranger's repository to add all of them.

The temperature sensors appear to be working - they were a bit glitchy immediately after I added them and only reported their battery but started ""working"" afterwards. They now report battery, temperature and humidity though they are not regular - when I use the graph function on the new ST app it only shows a 2-3 of entries for temp and humidity whereas there're literally dozens of check ins under the events tab and one would assume each check in event contained all the temp and humidity details. 

The contact sensors are the worst though - they've been stuck on open ever since I got them and I can't get them to update. I've tapped the reset button to manually get them to report and while each tap is reported under the check in tab on the app, the status does not update. They, too, show their battery levels but that's about it.

I've googled around a fair bit and haven't found anything. Everything was working perfectly on my HE (using the same devices as routers etc) until it decided to stop booting 2 weeks into the whole thing. I live in India so while the in-warranty replacement was approved and the replacement hub has reached my friend in the US, I won't be getting the hub until June or July when he comes back to India. Figured I'd use my ST hub which I had lying around but little did I know I'd run into these many complications. 

Could someone please help me?

eyqepa,1580824672,HomeSeer vs Hubitat vs Home Assistant,"I've been dabbling with home automation using SmartThings, Hue, Tradfri, and Aqara hubs and devices, using HomeKit and HomeBridge to tie them together. We are looking to move to a new house and it seems like a good time to start fresh. I'm seriously looking at HomeSeer , Hubitat and Home Assistant. I'd love to get everyone's opinion on these options.

My primary drivers are:

* Local Processing, which all these do
* Reliability
* Ease of setup
* Device support

HomeSeer appears to be the most reliable, and easy to set up. The lack of native ZigBee support is concerning, but not a dealbreaker. I haven't invested so much in ZigBee devices that I can't pivot to pure zwave, or to set up zigbee support later.

Home Assistant appears to be the most powerful with the most device support, but also the most work to set up. I'm at the point in my life where I no longer enjoy spending hours figuring out how to get things to work, so that's a big one for me. I'd love to have something that works ""out of the box"".

Hubitat appears to be a middle ground. Not quite as stable as HomeSeer, but easier to set up and manage than Home Assistant. It also supports Z-Wave and Zigbee and should support all my existing devices.

Cost is a factor, but the lowest one on my list. If a z-wave door sensor costs $30 vs $10 for a zigbee one, that's a pretty minor cost over the lifetime of the system imo.

What does everyone think? What would you go with, and why?

Where I’m stuck is I’m assuming that switch/dimmer isn’t compatible with the kit I was looking at and I have no idea what I need to connect it to Alexa.

eyy5i9,1580854378,Robot Vacuum Update,"A couple of months ago, I posted a question about robot vacuum suggestions here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/d6k493/robot\_vacuum\_reccomendations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/d6k493/robot_vacuum_reccomendations/)  I said I would come back to give an update, so here I am. I ended up getting a Neato D6. It happened to be on a lightning sale on Amazon a couple of weeks after I posted my original question, so I just went for it. Boy, am I glad I did. I have had a few hiccups, so I will talk about those first. My biggest complaint is about the WiFi connection. Some days, it just randomly decides not to connect. It doesn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to it, and by the next day its totally fine. I also think it is kind of confusing to re-connect it to WiFi. But maybe that's just me. It also randomly stalls in between my bathroom and dining room. The weirdest thing about that is that I never get a notification about it being stuck, like when it is physically stuck on something. But I just press the resume button and off it goes. So, strange, but whatever. I have had to re-map the house once after the first run, but that's not a huge deal either. The positives outweigh the cons in a big way. The magnetic strips it comes with are totally discreet, but if you still don't like them, you can just throw a rug over them. Way better than Roomba's virtual walls. The No-Go Lines are a game changer. It's so nice just to be able to draw a line around something and not have to worry about Neato going there, and if you don't need it any more, just delete the line. Awesome. It cleans my downstairs in half the time my old Roomba did. As for cleaning power, I'm not sure if it's any more powerful than Roomba, both do a great job at picking up the everyday dirt of living in the country and having a couple of cats in the house. As for the old Roomba, once I moved it upstairs, which has very defined rooms as opposed to the more open-floor plan downstairs, it hasn't missed a beat. So, if someone asked me what robot vacuum to get, I would say get a Neato, and if you have the extra money or found a good deal, get a D6 or above. Totally worth it. And if you are looking to upgrade your old robot vacuum, don't throw out the old one. It might work better in a different part of your house, or maybe a friend or family member could give it a good home!

Query a sensor value:

Returns:

0x01 0x03 0x08 0x00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0x95 D7

HA should display ""00 00 00 00 00 00 00""

Configure a setting:

0x01 0x11 0x1324 0x0001 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x43B9

Returns:

0x01 0x11 0x1324 0x0001 0x80 0x4546

Because we received 0x80 then HA can signal that the setting was accepted.

ez6biz,1580890613,I made a snack last night: Practical home automation?,"Last week I took my first steps into the world of modern home automation: Raspberry Pi/Hassio/Raspbee/5xTradfri bulbs. No actual automation yet, just a few light-scenes. One 'scene' is 'Night': A single bulb in the kitchen at minimum brightness, the rest turned off.    

Last night I made a snack and found that it's great to walk around with one bulb burning at low brightness, as opposed to the old situation where it was two bulbs blindingly full-on.   
I, however, also discovered that minimal brightness is not sufficient light for me, to make a snack. And that I have no way of turning up the brightness, unless I use my phone or computer.  

Being pragmatic and fond of gadgets, I'm thinking of putting some sort of switch together: using a rotary encoder to crank the brightness, have it somehow transmit that info to the bulb (Encoder → Hassio → Bulb) and stick it on the wall in the kitchen.  

Anyways, I'm curious how others solve this kind of practical 'problems'.",TomJC70,/r/homeautomation/comments/ez6biz/i_made_a_snack_last_night_practical_home/,4,homeautomation,17

ez8zzx,1580906551,Sonoff Cam: wifi not working (but presents success message),"Hi everybody,

I just received my `SONOFF GK-200MP2-B` yesterday. I tried connecting it via QR scan, which did not work (it will only load and eventually time out). Then there is a sound pairing method. My phone was connected to the wifi I want to connect it to. Then I started sound pairing, confirming my wifi network and entering its password.

The camera will successfully receive the information via sound (or so it seems). It will say something like ""wifi setup completed"" (don't remember the exact words, did that last night), then after a while ""trying to connect to the internet"", then ""connnected to the internet"".

Well. My router does not say that it is connected to the network at all, let alone to the internet. This is really weird. At first, I got a message about not being able to connect, so when I got the message about it being connected, I thought it would work. But it doesn't.

I tried three different networks. Two of which were both 2.4GHz and 5GHz. As the camera only supports 2.4GHz, I tried the dedicated 2.4GHz network (which I had to set up for my printer a while ago, it does only support 2.4GHz and will not connect to a network that supports both). It would not connect to either of those, not even the 2.4GHz only. But it did tell me that it had connected successfully.

I use `Unifi` APs with a `pfSense` firewall / router. Neither of those show a new device. Which is weird because pfsense is the DHCP server and will always show newly connected devices in its pool. 

I then connected the camera via ethernet cable. Restarted. There it was. I was able to connect via the `ewelink` app, enable `rtsp`, and view the feed. However, I was not able to view nor change the wifi credentials or even status. 

Does anybody know what I can do to fix this? The camera was not meant to be in my office (where the router is), but neither of the rooms I'd like to use it in has an ethernet connection.

I wasn't able to find something similar to `Xiaomi Dafang Hack`, which provides a different firmware for the camera run directly from an SD card. I wasn't able to telnet into the camera due to not having the credentials, so I don't really know what else I can do.

(A) Standardize on iPad/Homekit and Homebridge.  Use Apple as the hub, and get Homebridge for all non-supported devices.  Pros: split-screen dashboard. More robust option to control my Sonos zones via Homebridge.  More flexibility to add new devices down the road.  Cons: ongoing setup/management of Homebridge and plugins.  Most of my devices are Nest.

(B) Buy a Google Nest Hub or Max and call it a day.  Pros: most of my devices are Nest.  Seems like the easiest, least time consuming route.  Clean interface with good integration.  Cons: least flexible / extensible.  Barebones Sonos/Spotify support.  All of our phones run iOS.  Can't really mount it to a wall, would sit on the counter.

eztyxj,1581003170,Split gas bill with my girlfriend (should work for roommates too),"Lots of us share expenses with people we live with, and its rarely an option to split billing between two people.

An app called Splitwise is really useful for tracking and settling shared expenses. It's basically a ledger that integrates with Venmo so you know exactly who owes what at any given time. However, on its own, Splitwise it really only shines for fixed recurring bills (like rent or cable). Otherwise, you have to enter everything manually, which is no easier than just using Venmo for a 2-person situation.

I wanted to automate the gas and electric bill, but those change every month so I can't pre-program. Here's what I just set up.

1. Set up Splitwise with your roomate -- this is fairly self-explanatory. Make sure they set their account up (and join your ""group"") before you proceed to Step 2.
2. Go to Zapier and create an account.
3. In Zapier, create another account for ""Email Parser by Zapier"".
4. In the email parser, create a new mailbox for each bill. For me, this is like ""UniqueNameGasBill@robot.zapier.com"".
5. In Gmail, create a filter that scoops up your bill email and only your bill email. I used a combination of the sender address and subject line. **The ""bill email"" here needs to have the dollar amount that you owe for that month.**
6. Using that filter, forward the bill email to your Email Parser mailbox. This should happen every time you get a bill in the future. Forward one manually for now to get the parser set up.
7. In the Email Parser, find the dollar amount that you owe, highlight, and turn it into a field (e.g., ""BillAmount"". Only highlight the currency symbol and dollar amount in the body of the email (e.g., ""$120.50"").
8. Back in the main Zapier site, create a new Zap that starts with a ""Email Parser by Zapier"" widget.
9. Set it up to look for new emails in the Email Parser mailbox you just set up.
10. Add Splitwise as the second step in the Zap.
11. Have Splitwise pull through the bill amount field (i.e., ""BillAmount"") as the expense amount
12. If you are paying the bill, make sure you are first on the list of people. If you have 1 roommate, add them as the second person (and so on).
13. Test everything -- if you followed these steps, you should see a new expense in the ledger every time you get a bill email.

Let me know if you have any trouble setting this up!

I will be building a new home and I am considering a lighting control system like Lutron, Crestron, KNX etc (I am in EU). 

I was initially planning to do just the ground floor (large open plan space) and garden, where I have a lot of light circuits and lots of glass, and I didn't want to fill the few walls I have with switches. I also like the idea of being able to use scenes instead of having to adjust several switches to get the mood I want each time. 

The integrator I spoke to suggested that I do the whole house instead of just ground floor + garden. But the price is double, and I am not sure if its worth it. My upstairs rooms are relatively small, 2-3 light circuits max in each room, and I have plenty of walls to place traditional switches. I feel that light scenes wouldn't be as useful in such small rooms also.

ezzzcn,1581026537,Blocking internet access for smart bulbs,"I'm running an Asus RT-AC3100 router. I was checking into ways to possibly secure my handful of smart lights on my network without getting into VLANs (too complicated for me right now) and without setting up a guest network (which I've read doesn't really isolate things the way I would hope). The bulbs connect direct with the router, there is no hub. They're all connected on 2.4 GHz signal, everything works as it should, I can control them fine with my Google Home Minis and from the app directly.

Here is where it gets a bit weird. Just to see what happens, I disabled the bulbs' internet access. Once disabled, I can still turn them on and off via the app and via Google Home using my voice. I figured maybe this was because I was on the same network. So I disabled my WiFi and connected to cell, and lo and behold, I could still control the lights with my app.

I would have thought by disabling internet access to the bulbs, this would have blocked outside access, and thus I wouldn't have been able to control when not on home network (wasn't even sure if I'd be able to control while on the same network). Just to check, I disabled internet on my tablet, and sure enough, it couldn't do anything until I turned access back on.

I must be misunderstanding how this all works. Is it still able to control the lights because the app is synced with my Google account and the minis were still online?

f0018v,1581026738,Need suggestions on how to trigger LEDs behind TV to turn on,"edit: My solution is an energy monitoring smart outlet. Thanks all!!

I recently picked up some smart LED strips to put behind my TV. I'd like the strips to automatically turn on when the TV is in use.

Couple pieces of info:

*  The TV is always on but controlled by a receiver (auto sleeps when not in use, but is technically always on)

*  I have an Alexa and smart things hub / multipurpose sensors / motion sensor
 
What I've tried:

* Triggering via vibration from the multipurpose sensor, tried placing the sensor on top of my subwoofer and also in the air vent on it, but it doesn't reliably create enough vibration for the multipurpose sensor to pick it up

What I've got temporarily working:

* Multipurpose sensor placed on top of my receiver, triggering the lights to turn on when a temperature threshold is met (receiver gets warmer when it is actively doing something)

This solution isn't good enough though due to variance in temperatures throughout the day and year.

f00omq,1581029380,Nest Thermostat-E and Ventilation Fan wiring,"Hi all,

I don't have any HVAC training or experience, bear with me...

I had a Honeywell T4 Pro thermostat and there is a standard light switch labelled ""Ventilation Fan"" right [next to the thermostat](https://imgur.com/u3Xx3A0). 

I've changed the Honeywell thermostat to Nest Thermostat-E and never had any issue since then.

I had a ventilation issue recently that happened in a different part of the house and was told by someone that the switch next to the thermostat is used to bring in fresh air and push out stale air. This was something that I wasn't told by the builder. 

The wife is committed to making sure that we utilize this daily and I suck at remembering to do things. I was going to replace the switch with a TP Link HS210 so that I can take advantage of the scheduling feature. 

I popped open the switch and [found this behind](https://imgur.com/08OIWYx) the light switch. I was expecting standard electrical wiring, so I aborted it.

I poked around and looked at how the wiring was setup and I want to run this by you guys to see if I'm on track about this.

The Nest Thermostat-E wiring [looks like this](https://imgur.com/s2RAJlN). Green and Red appears to be used for fan control while W1 is for heating and C is powering Thermostat unit itself.

I traced the cable that goes from Nest Thermostat-E and it goes into the [Armstrong A95UH1D furnace](https://imgur.com/KtI5HyL). I've circled the Red and Green wire that comes from Nest Thermostat-E.

Now, there is also another set of wire in the same port (forgive me, I'm a computer tech and didn't know the proper term). I traced the second cable and it goes to [RNC5-ES Heat Recovery Ventilator](https://imgur.com/yAmJ9W5). Red cable on the left side goes to the furnace. Red cable on the right side, disappears up into the wall and I assume it goes into the light switch that is next to the thermostat.

Now, my understanding of this setup is that the original thermostat did not have the ability to turn the fan on without turning the heater on. Hence, why there is a switch next to the thermostat for ventilation fan control only. 

By upgrading the thermostat to Nest Thermostat-E, I now have the ability to turn the ventilation fan on without needing to turn the heater on. Is that correct?

If that's the case, I don't even need to replace the vent fan switch with a smart switch as the Nest app has a feature that allows me to automatically turn the fan on based on a schedule.",BrockN,/r/homeautomation/comments/f00omq/nest_thermostate_and_ventilation_fan_wiring/,5,homeautomation,1

f054bd,1581049081,Unpatched Hue hubs vulnerable to zigbee attack,"Anyone with a hue hub that hasn't been updated in the past month is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack that can allow code to be installed on the hub.

https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123491/philips-hue-bulb-hack-hub-firmware-patch-update

This is a multistep attack. Someone has to first attack an unpatched hue bulb, irritate the owner into re-enrolling the bulb with the hub, then launch a zigbee data flood attack with a specific payload. This means they need to be in fairly close physical proximity on multiple occasions.

Before everyone loses their mind, remember that each manufacturer writes the code that implements the zigbee spec and that there is no 3rd party testing to say they followed it entirely right or not. Given that a patch was generated in just a few weeks, I would assume this is a hue specific flaw.

Could other zigbee devices have a similar flaw? Yes, but odds are that if it exists, it will be somewhat different, so it would require an attack tailored to each zigbee controller. Hue is high profile so it's a clear target, and they have done a lot of firmware revisions over the years for thr code to get crufty.

Basically, it is an app that helps you in a few ways. It lets you keep track of the things in your house for insurance purposes in case of a fire or some other disaster. It can be used to help you remember where your stuff is. Everything is automatically backed up to the cloud. It also has a few cool home automation applications. Once you have entered in all of your stuff and its location(down to cabinets and shelves), you can tell the Google Assistant to ""Ask HouseBook where my umbrella is"" and it will respond with ""Your umbrella is in the top shelf of the entryway closet."" Or think about when you are making a smoothie and you forgot where the blender is. You can just say ""Hey Google, ask HouseBook where my blender is."" and it will say ""Your blender is in the bottom drawer of the cabinet by the sink."" You can also share your house with others(Android only for now. iOS coming soon). This can be used for things like....

\- An AirBnb host sharing their house with a tenant. Maybe the tenant needs to know where extra toilet paper is, if the house is going to have pots and pans, how to set up the hot tub etc.

\- Sharing your house with a babysitter coming over so they know where things are.

\- Showing your collection to a friend.

\- A museum documenting their pieces.

etc.

I think this has the potential to be a pretty big idea and I am just getting started with it. Please let me know if you have any Suggestions/Feedback/Feature Requests/Bug Reports. Also, 5 star ratings are a big help. :)

f0g7f1,1581106732,Now I know if the dog has been fed,"EDIT: updates at bottom. Updated images link with pistons!

Image: http://imgur.com/gallery/cHVz26K

Added a smartthings contact sensor to my dogs food storage container. Wrote a webcore piston so when it's opened it records the time the dog was fed. Also, changed my daily reminder to feed the dog based off of location and time, rather than just time (was everyday at 6pm, now that only happens if I'm home and he hasn't been fed). 

Also set it up with a button I can press or I can ask google if the dog has been fed and it'll notify me letting me know if he's been fed or not. Works really well as it's sometimes hard keeping track with multiple people feeding him. 

Also have a smartthings button to record when he has been let out, and if it goes longer than 3 hours it notifies anyone who's home to take the dog out.

EDIT: Updated link with pistons in it. Codes for pistons are: 07kr &amp; ZSOW

Here's how they work:

2 pistons, one is dog fed, other is dog fed reminder. 

You also need a virtual switch for the phone button / google ask reminder feature. And a global variable to set status. 

I feed my dog at 6am and 6pm daily (or try to at least) 

For dog fed piston:

If sensor is opened, save a variable saying dog fed (breakfast if before noon, dinner if after) and save time with it too. Every day at 12:01 am and pm the variable resets to saying dog has not had breakfast/ dinner.  

Now for the reminder piston:

I have a virtual switch called dog fed. If it's turned on it will send out a push notification with the feed status, and then turn the switch off so it can be sent again. 


Every day at 6pm if I am home, in vacation mode, or in night mode it will send me a reminder to feed the dog. If he has already been fed, it won't send the reminder. 

If I am in away mode (or guest mode) it will set a variable true, and when I return home it will remind me then. This way I don't get a notification while I am out for dinner, and get it when I actually need to be reminded. 

That's about it, hope it helps and don't forget to click on the imgur link to check out the pistons!",Kleinja,/r/homeautomation/comments/f0g7f1/now_i_know_if_the_dog_has_been_fed/,163,homeautomation,49
f0gbdz,1581107168,Is It possible to install un-wired switch to control an outlet,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this sub and would love some input from you.  
  
I am interested in adding under cabinet lighting in my kitchen.  I am not interested in using Google or Amazon to turn it on.  I would like a good old fashioned switch.  The problem I foresee, is wiring it.  Where I want the switch - is not where it would be easy to wire.   

[Overall Kitchen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/dkanpJs.jpg)  
[Switch side of Kitchen](https://i.imgur.com/XJ7DiEV.jpg)  
[Switch location](https://i.imgur.com/cXVapzY.jpg)  
  
So the switch is to the left of the back door.  Currently the 3rd switch on the bottom right turns on the recessed can lights.  What I would like to do is replace the single witch with a new switch that has 2 rockers on it.  One that will continue to turn the hard wired can lights on and off, and the other one that will turn the new under counter lights on and off (wireless?).   

I have outlets under the cabinets in 3 locations.  I can easily switch an outlet out and use a plug-in style under cabinet led lighting system, but i would rather not have to manually turn them on and off at that location.  So I was wondering what you would recommend for this situation.  Is there a ""wireless"" double rocker plate switch that will pair with a new outlet that could be toggled by the switch?   
  
The only thing I have that would fall into the home automation category is a Logitech Harmony Hub.  But I really don't want to have to use my phone to turn lights off, or talk to my kitchen.  
  
**edit** - I should add the switch that controls the can lights is a three-way switch.  There is one on the other side of the kitchen that will turn the lights on and off as well.",Balue442,/r/homeautomation/comments/f0gbdz/is_it_possible_to_install_unwired_switch_to/,2,homeautomation,20

f0rizk,1581168265,To use Wi-Fi devices or not,"I know flavors of this question are asked a million times on this sub, and I apologize I’m asking as well. I’m just a bit overwhelmed. 

I’m not sure if I should just go down the WiFi device route due to how few (at least in my opinion) devices I am looking for, or if I should still invest and look into a hub. 

What I want 
- 6-8 smart dimmable switches
- 2 switches for outdoor lights that turn on before sunset and turn off after sunrise 
- 1 smart lock
- 1 doorbell camera
- 1 flood light camera (leaning towards ring so I don’t need to run any wires and leverage its solar battery pack) 

So I think most of those I can find as WiFi devices. Even the timer switch they sell WiFi ones so don’t need to create a automation routine via a hub. 

Or am I still better off what a hub. If so which one? I’ve considered SmartThings due to its simplicity or go all in with HomeAssistant. Any other recommendations? 
If I do stick to WiFi devices can I use them if my network goes down? I don’t want to get stuck being unable to turn my lights on if my network goes down. From my understanding using the hub helps when you have many devices as it creates a stronger mesh network. If I don’t have as many devices will I have issues of a “weaker” mesh?

Currently the house doesn't have any recessed lighting, and that is something I want to do. I decided I am going with Lutron Caseta. My parents house has it, and I feel it's a good intro system for myself as my house is only about 1000 sq. ft. 

My main question is since i'll have to run any recessed cans for the remodel, are there any recommended units for retrofits that are Caseta compatible. I found the LED compatibility tool on the Lutron site, but it seems to be aimed more for the bulbs. I am just wondering if there is something like that for the cans (hopefully thats the correct terminology).

I'd like to automate my intercom (Proel PC255), neither Nuki nor Nello support it, so I opened it up and the board itself looks pretty simple:

* On the top-left there's a spring that is kept pressed when the phone is hung on the base;
* The jumpers are used to configure the apartment number (you must sum the active jumper numbers, in my case it's 55);
* The button on the right is the one to open the door, note that it sends a signal only when the phone is picked up (the spring is not compressed);
* The two wires send all the signals, so it must be digital (voice in - voice out - ring - open signal);
* The system seems to work at 4-10V DC;

Unfortunately I can't find any schematic on the web, so I doubt it's going to be possible to connect an Arduino to control it digitally.

Te alternative I can think of is to connect to the spring and button circuits with something like a Shelly or a Sonoff and close them when I want to open the door.

Does anyone have experience with similar boards and have any suggestion? Do you think I can automate this somehow?

1) my kids NEVER turn bathroom lights off. Sure I could schedule the Zooz lights to go off at night, but that’ll leave them on all day. I figure motion detectors would serve this purpose well
2) I don’t think voice control is all that important for the bathrooms. 2 of the 3 have the switches right at the door so I can’t imagine using voice in them. 
3) I think turning the lights on automatically at night would be awesome and seems like the biggest upgrade I can make to bathroom lights.

&amp;#x200B;

My in-laws are wanting a video doorbell (they're older and going up and down the stairs gets to be quite tedious), but from what I am seeing it looks like most of the doorbells only work down to \~0-5F. We, however, live in Chicago and it's not that farfetched to have a week (or two) of temperatures in that range. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this leaves me with two main questions:

1. If the doorbell starts to malfunction when it's cold, does it regain full function when the temperatures rise?
2. What device do you have and what experiences have you had with weather-related issues?

I would really like to not have several different hubs for smart lighting, and have need to automate some devices that can not use smart bulbs. So essentially what I need is a smart dimmer switch that can be touched by Hue, and can control all the light fixtures that use dumb lighting. 

Many of the threads I have read are from more than a year ago, and I haven't found anything concrete or a solution that doesn't require another hub. 

Is my best solution going to be to abandon Hue in favor of something more widely available like Leutron? Are there any third party switches which might integrate with hue to control dumb lights?

Im not keen on abandoning my hue, as I have already sunk a cost there, but if their walled garden is too restrictive, I might need to branch out.

f1xufs,1581372362,Sanity Check: New Home Install,"My wife and I just bought a new home, and I am planning out my smart home install. I don't have any friends/acquaintances that are into HA, so I want to run my plan by the subreddit, and get some recommendations for solutions.

Here is what I already own (some of it older from our previous home, some purchased for the new home) that will be installed at the new home:

* Abode Security System
  * 8 window sensors
  * 3 door sensors
  * 3 motion detectors
  * 1 smoke alarm detector
  * 24/7 monitoring
* 2 Google Home Hubs
* 1 Nest Wifi Mesh with 3 satellites (which work as Assistant points)
* 4 Google Home Minis
* Nest Hello doorbell
* Yale SL with August lock
*Chamberlain MyQ Garage Door
* Ecobee 4 thermostat
* Logitech Harmony Hub
* Switches (all of the below are the older Z-Wave switches)
  * 8 GE Z-Wave On/Off
  * 1 GE Z-Wave Dimmer
  * 2 GE Add-On 
* Philips Hue with 3 bulbs and light strips (for under-cabinet and accent lighting)

So far, my plan has been to identify a home automation controller (Home Assistant/Homeseer/Hubitat) to run the smart home system completely separate from the Abode security system, passing states from Abode to the HA controller. I then will build routines/access from the HA controller to Google Home to allow for voice control throughout the house.

The whole idea behind this was to establish a separation of concerns, where Abode handles 100% of the alarm-related monitoring, while the HA controller handles everything else.

So now, my questions:

1. Does this make sense from an architecture standpoint?
2. Considering the breadth of devices I'm bringing into the system, which HA controller would you recommend?
3. I'm looking at adding more switches - there are 28 total switches in the house, so I need to buy 17 more. So:

  a. Is there any issue with mixing Z-Wave and Z-Wave Plus devices?   
  b. What Z-Wave Plus switches would you recommend to add? I've been looking at the Innovelli Reds, but want to make sure they'd jive well with this setup.

f1zcyq,1581378446,Buying a New Construction Home - Need Help with Wiring and Automation,"Hey everyone, I recently bought a townhouse that is under construction. I get to make selections on the building process and am attempting to plan out how I would want to automate the home in the future more than I do so now. I am trying to get an understanding if I am screwing up the wiring and if there is anywhere I should upgrade. I read as much as I could on here in previous months and just had a quick question on how to proceed. This is not my forever home, so this is just to make me happy for the next 5-10 years... though this is all subject to life being a bitch. 

I get 3 ""standard"" choices of Cable Jack (RG-6 cable) or Phone Jack with Cat 5 wire. 

The cost to get additional wiring is $150 for a Phone jack, $150 for a cable jack, and $215 for a Cat6 jack. 



**My main questions are:** 

1. I wanted to know if that basic phone jack would be suitable to run internet to a TV and what I would need, if anything, to make that works such as a converter. Basically it says it is a Cat 5 wire, but phone jack has me thinking that it is an RJ11 vs an RJ45. I know that is a question for the builder which I did ask and am waiting for an answer, but I wanted to make sure it was something I could convert if I had to.


2. For those who built their house, what did you do to increase your enjoyment in the wiring department. I am adding an RG-6 and phone jack (unless question 1 says I need anything else) at every part of the house that will have a tv (mainly the living room and master bedroom for now). 


3. I am adding Cat 6 cable upgrades to my office. I know some people say this is overkill (in any other part of reddit but here), but should I run this elsewhere, or will potentially running it to my computer and router be sufficient for the remainder of the house? I am capped at gigabit connection right now in the area. 


4. Is there anything else that people recommend as I go through this process that I might be missing? I spoke with the team today about conduit, but they gave me a price $3000+ for it to be added, so I figured a few additional outlets placed now should be sufficient for the next few years.





**For reference, my current set up is fairly basic with the following:**

Nest Thermostat

Kasa tp-link wi-fi plugs

google nest hub in living room and minis in each side room

Wyze cams and Wyze sensors on each door. 



**Future Upgrades will include:**

Smart Garage door, Door Locks, Doorbell, Lights, Switches, Fridge, etc.

f29mwi,1581433910,Replacing an old manual Gas Boiler Controller,"This has ended up being a long post, sorry! I've been searching for a while and I'm hoping someone can help me figure out what the hell I want to do and what kit I actually need for replacing some older heating control kit in a house we just moved in to as I'm getting confused :D

First, I'm based in the UK which is probably relevant, I've got a regular gas boiler and a standard manual controller, with two heating zones (upstairs and downstairs) as well as a hot water zone, this one:

ChannelPlus XL (Model H37) - 
http://horstmann.securemeters.com/files/8814/6916/4125/user_guide_H37XL-USeries21.pdf

There are also manual thermostat controls in the hall downstairs and the landing upstairs that look exactly like this:

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Danfoss-Randall-087N110000-Room-10amp/dp/B00BJ75AUI/

The boiler they hook in to is Greenstar 40CDI Classic Regular:

https://www.boilerguide.co.uk/productinfo/worcester-bosch/greenstar-40cdi-classic-regular-gas-boiler

I've added Eurotronic TRVs (Zwave) in a lot of the rooms and it is hooked up to HomeAssistant, but I'd also like to replace that manual Channel plus controller and possibly the danfoss thermostats.

I don't really want to be investing in a solution only to realise it's not what I want, or more likely that it's overkill for what I need. I think my main requirements would be:

* I'm not fussed about being able to control the heating outside of the house, actually I actively don't want to hook in to an external service for this purpose.
* I would like to retain the three zones that already exist but primarily control the temperature using the eurotronics .
* I would like to be able to create a weekly schedule for controlling the status of the boiler (on / off) for each of the zones.
* I would like to be able to access and create that schedule wirelessly via app or website that only communicates on the home network.
* I'd rather have HomeAssistant or a programmable API rather, voice control is not important to me.
* WiFi protocol is probably the only thing that will work here, I have the Z-wave network though if that's relevant.

I'm not really that fussed on the thermostat capabilities, I think my requirements are pretty basic.. essentially control and program the boiler wirelessly from within the house.

As far as I can tell I can just going out and buy the likes of a nest, replace the manual controller with their controller but then all the programming would be done through their portable thermostats. Looks like I have to power those with USB and I'd be tied in to a closed ecosystem.

I think what I want to know is are there other options out there that suit my more basic requirements, every time I search I get results for fancy smart thermostats that do everything from control the temperature to washing your car and ordering your groceries, I just want something basic. Maybe I'm talking out of my arse with what I want to do and that's why I can't find what I'm looking.

* Is it possible to buy just a controller replacement that leans more towards the automation of the boiler control based on me programming a schedule, rather than having to have thermostats over the place controlling the on and off status.
* If I did have thermostats for other parts of the house, could I re-use the Danfoss locations so that the device would be powered and I can ignore it most of the time? Maybe the Danfoss ones are just battery operating o_O I'll have to check that.
* There seems to be a lot of love for Ecobee here, are they a more open system than the nest / hive? and are they even available in the UK.
* I've also seen some Tado systems and something called a CT100 
* I don't really plan to move to SmartThings but would it be possible to get a solution that works with both. This would more be a usability thing depending on the wife acceptance factor. 

Sorry for such a long post!

TL;DR &gt; Looking for a smart heating control system for the boiler and all of the smart systems out there seem to require thermostats to be paired.

My problem is, that I have multiple windows in my living room (basically two windows and a door to the balcony. I only were able to realize (with three separate routines with Alexa) that the heater goes off if one of the windows/the door is open.

f2ge21,1581460253,My experience getting into home automation - 1 month look back,"hi everyone,

i don't reply/post much, but i thought i would share my experience to possibly benefit those who are new (like i was), and maybe receive some guidance from some of the more experience automaters. this will be a bit of a wall, but there will be a tldr.

&amp;#x200B;

to start, a little over a month ago, i would put myself just above a level zero when it came to automation. couple google minis, and that's literally it. sort of. my dad had actually gotten a deal on the nest thermostat/doorbell awhile back, but after i saw the guide on those and that there was some electrical work needed, i tabled the prospect of setting those up for awhile. i wouldn't say i'm a diy expert, but i've done some woodworking over the past year, but those are 2 very different things.

&amp;#x200B;

so fast forward a bit (closer to the 1 month ago timeline), and i found out my (younger) sister installed a nest doorbell mostly by herself. so i asked her to give a bit of guidance and one day decided to just go for it, and installed the nest doorball. was pretty cool, and honestly not that difficult looking back, but i guess i was intimidated by never having done any sort of wiring before. having done that, i figured that the nest thermostat shouldn't be too bad either. and by this point, i'm starting to browse r/SmartHomes and r/homeautomation, just to see what's going on and get an idea of things. i take some time out, install the nest thermostat, and buy used, but like new, google hub (""hub"") for a visual control center of sorts.

&amp;#x200B;

by this point, i've started to read into the zigbee/zwave/wifi protocols, and see different automations people have posted, and my interest is increasing. i learn what a real hub is, how it can handle automations locally, without internet, and make a few home tasks a bit easier, and i decide i want to invest a bit more into the home automation deal.

&amp;#x200B;

now this might be where others can learn from my experience. i wanted to make sure that if i bought something, it wouldn't be redundant or replaced if i bought more. i wanted to make it future proof in that sense that i can expand on it, not replace it. i like the idea of having a base that can always be built on, and with that, i was trying to decide between the ""infamous"" home assistant, and smartthings. i had seen smart things in the google home app (i also have a samsung phone) so it was more familiar to me than home assistant. but home assistant seemed to be a blank slate make what you will of it type of deal, and that appealed to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

i was on the fence for awhile, until i came across this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/ec58db/i\_made\_a\_gif\_to\_illustrate\_how\_easy\_it\_is\_to\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/ec58db/i_made_a_gif_to_illustrate_how_easy_it_is_to_get/) 

&amp;#x200B;

seeing the simplicity of getting it set up, and the comments left by u/rufusmccoot, gave me some confidence, and i bought an rpi4 bundle off ebay to go down the home assistant [hass.io](https://hass.io) route. this was maybe at that 1month ago mark that i keep referring to.

the first, and maybe only thing, that i'll recommend, is that if you do go down the rpi/hassio route, consider an NUC pc unit thing (based on my little research, its stronger but more maintainable and expandable) OR if you want to get an rpi, consider the 3b+. i'm not sure if i'd recommend the 3b+ over the 4, but i say consider because the 3b+ is older, and therefore, you can use an external ssd quite easily, as opposed to the 4. i'll come back to why this is important later on.

&amp;#x200B;

so i set up [hass.io](https://hass.io), after a bit of struggle since i thought i had to physically connect to the rpi for hassio (spoilers: you dont, you just connect to it using any web browser), so after a few re-flashes, i got it connected and ready to go. once that was done, i wanted to connect it to google assistant so it could work natively with my google devices. this was many, many hours of headache, and it came down to using the link with a port ([http://lik](http://like)ethis:port) when it actually wasn't needed. i don't know if i thought to take the port off or if i found another example not using it, but i got that working, and then i could get onto automations.

&amp;#x200B;

so for [hass.io](https://hass.io) automations, you can use the UI or you can code it like text in a file. having software dev experience, i thought i could pick it up. i would say i was right and wrong. YAML doesn't code like python or java or c# at all really. but the problem is, even if it did, you'd still have to know how to call entities or services and what not. basically, it's like me telling you to use objects/properties/methods without telling you what they are. you'd still have to spend time to learn those key words, so i'm not sure how much of an ""advantage"" i have with my background.

&amp;#x200B;

but with all that said, i was able to get some basic google/hassio integrations. i invested in [opengarage.io](https://opengarage.io) and got that set up as well, and things were going pretty decently. till about 1.5 - 2 weeks ago. when everything just stopped working.

&amp;#x200B;

i couldn't connect to hassio from the browser, power cycle didn't help. i didn't know how to access logs or anything, and after trying/googling for awhile, i gave up and went with a fresh start. luckily, i had made a backup after getting google assistant linked, so i just had to redo my automations, but getting back to hassio + google linked wasn't so bad. now this is the part where i talk about the external storage option. i'm inclined to think it was an sd card failure, even tho i bought a samsung one. i thought it was the endurance one too, but i don't have it on me so i can't confirm. it could be bias though, since i've read a lot about sd card failures, and writing to an external ssd (that can easily be done on 3b+ compared to rpi4) makes it a LOT better. 

&amp;#x200B;

at this point in time, i added a few zwave outlets and things are working well. but when things went down, i had no idea what to do, and at that point i was thinking ""no way can i recommend [hass.io](https://hass.io)"". with all that being said, i don't think [hass.io](https://hass.io) is a terrible option, but that time investment is definitely there. i've seen people asking about hubs, but they say they don't want to put in the time, and honestly, smartthings or other hubs don't look like they need that time investment. plus, i don't think any family member would want to even look at [hass.io](https://hass.io), when smartthings might be more approachable (ui and mobile wise) than [hass.io](https://hass.io). i don't think [hass.io](https://hass.io) is evil, but i also don't think its for everyone. but now i can see why people recommend it, because in an ideal scenario, it's the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr - started with google minis. got nest doorbell/thermostat installed with a bit of help. felt empowered. got rpi4 for [hass.io](https://hass.io). struggled, but then got it to work. then added google assistant. struggled some more. then got automations working. then it crashed and idk why and i struggled a lot. but now things are working fine and i just make frequent backups. 

&amp;#x200B;

my next point of research is logging vs database and what i can do to keep my sd card alive.

&amp;#x200B;

that should be it for now, but it's time for me to leave work so even if i had more to say i would cut it off. if i think of more, i will add it. please let me know if you have any questions, especially newcomers/those considering it.",deadlyrang,/r/homeautomation/comments/f2ge21/my_experience_getting_into_home_automation_1/,9,homeautomation,5

f2h95b,1581463679,Roborock S5 3.5.7 Firmware Not Loading Map on FloleVac,"I recently upgraded the firmware on my freshly acquired Roborock S5 to the latest version (that I could find anyway), 3.5.7. Since doing so, the Flolevac app does not load the map created (and yes, save map mode is enabled) by a full house cleaning. The map is perfectly visible and accurate in the Mi Home app.

The reason I need it to load in the FloleVac app is I've already got HomeAssistant running and I'd like to be able to use voice commands for certain rooms. FloleVac is how I was getting the room coordinates (before I upgraded the vac's firmware) to plug into my cleaning scripts.

So, has anyone else encountered/solved this issue? Is there another app I can use to obtain coordinates? I know I can just downgrade to an earlier firmware version, but I'd like to save that as a last resort.  
   
  
**Update**: I've discovered a workaround. This method applies to both the S5 variants running on the latest firmware and the S6. It takes a bit of time to go through the entire process, but it's a much more accurate solution in the long run than using specific coordinates.

So, originally my scripts were set up using the ""app_zoned_clean"" command like so:

    vacuum_dining:
      alias: ""Vacuum Dining Room""
      sequence:
        - service: vacuum.send_command
          data:
            entity_id: vacuum.xiaomi_vacuum_cleaner
            command: app_zoned_clean
            params: [[25155,24614,28705,28414,1]]

I discovered an alternative command for xiaomi vaccums, ""app_segment_clean"" which essentially tells it vacuum a room that is set up within the map via the Mi Home app itself. Each room is assigned a number (I believe 1 through 30 is the range, but mine didn't start until 16 and ended at 26). My scripts now look like this:

    vacuum_dining:
      alias: ""Vacuum Dining Room""
      sequence:
        - service: vacuum.send_command
          data:
            entity_id: vacuum.xiaomi_vacuum_cleaner
            command: app_segment_clean
            params: [23]

So, to start with you need to go and edit your map(s) within your app to create the rooms you want. Then, with your Mi Home app open, send your robot to each numbered room either by editing your existing scripts or creating a bunch of test scripts to call. Pay attention to the map each time you send it to a room number and mark which number corresponds to a room. Once you have all your numbers, simply plug them into your scripts and you're done! The only downside to this is that I assume you'd have to repeat this process if you ever edit your map(s) and add/remove/edit rooms.

f2hu50,1581466091,Long range water tank sensor?,"Hi

So we've got a small farm with a number of water tanks dotted around the property. I'd like to automatically / electronically determine the water level in each tank and report that back to Home Assistant for display (and potential automation in the future).

Anyway, I've got the measuring of the water level in a tank worked out with a prototype board using a NodeMCU and a JSN-SR04t ultrasonic range sensor. Works fairly well connecting over WiFi for the closeup tanks.

There are a couple of downsides of my current prototype:

1. WiFi connection will only work for some of the tanks, i.e. only for the tanks that are close enough to the house to be within WiFi range.
2. The prototype seems to be fairly power hungry. Running of 4 x 18650 batteries I might get 4 days use out of them before I have to recharge the batteries. I feel 4 days is way to short to be workable especially when you multiply that out to 6 tanks... :-O

Doing some research I think some Arduinos with LoRa long range radios and some custom code to check the tanks a couple of times a day and putting the Arduinos into deep sleep somehow in between would probably work well and be fairly power efficient.

For me the question now is:

**?? Which type of Arduino and LoRa hardware are well supported, work well and support some kind of deep sleep?**

Any suggestions much appreciated.",marksburgunder,/r/homeautomation/comments/f2hu50/long_range_water_tank_sensor/,8,homeautomation,18

I'm Steven and pretty new to this Topic ""Smarthome""(also new to Reddit ^^).
I have a few Questions and wanted to ask some experts like you Guys if you could help me out.


That's my Plan:

I want to make a ""Automated Home Movie Theater"" which I can Control with a Amazon Echo. The Screen should lower and close automatically (on Command), with it should start the Projector and the 5.1 Soundsystem (also everything should oprn/close/start individually). Want to Play Games on it via Consoles/ Steam link or watch some Series on Amazon Fire TV 4K Stick/AmazonPrime. Also I want some Light(-Strips) around the Bed, Table, Couch and a Lightpanel on the selling.

Things I want to Purchase and/or use:


- Amazon Echo Dot 3. Gen + Logitech Harmony Elite Hub

- Fire TV Stick 4K

- Steam link (Box)

- The Projector (Optoma UHD3200A - 4K HDR 3D - Heimkinoraum Editon)

- The Screen (Motorleinwand Elite Screens Saker Tab Tension -MaxWhite)

- Reciver (AV-Reciver Yamaha RX-V685 Heimkinoraum Edition) 

- Soundsystem (Consono 35 MK3 ""5.1-Set)

- Lightstrips ( https://www.ebay.de/itm 293054218092  --&gt; don't know how to paste a Link to be klick on ^^')

- Alexa Adapter for Lightstripe (https://www.ebay.de/itm/254332078329)

- Lightpanel (https://www.ebay.de/itm/333435856056)




My Question:

1. Do I need some Bridges for these Products? What are Bridges and what they do?

2. Does some one of you use some of the Products above and can tell what do you think about them?

3. Will it work if I use the Combination Screen, Projector, Harmony Hub to Automate everything?

4. What possiblity do I have with this kind of Setup/ Echo Dot 3. Gen.?

5. Can I tell Alexa that she should switch to the next HDMI- Port on the Reciver or do I need to do this Manual?

6. Will the Light Setup work with the Harmony Hub?

7. Dose this howl Smarthome Setup use much of the Wifi?

7. .... If I will have more Questions I will Edit them in or ask In the Comments ^^.



Thank you for your support, if you have Questions, just comment down below, I will answer.

f2iysi,1581470774,Are there any smart light switches that replicate the tactile interface of a non-smart switch?,"**tl;dr**: what I mean by this is a toggle switch (and/or brightness slider) that the user can operate like an old style switch, BUT which can also be actuated by the device.

I like the idea of smart switches, but every one I've used is, IMO, strictly worse than a standard switch, in terms of the ""user experience"" when operating the switch itself. A mechanical toggle switch seems simple, but it is actually the perfect interface for a light. This is equally true for a physical slider for a dimmer. 

Smart switches replace these physical interfaces with pushbuttons that talk to a microcontroller, which might display state information on some sort of LED display on the switch. This is unnecessary electronic complexity, inferior to the mechanical functionality it replaces.

I understand that there might not be a large market for this, or that I'm just a cranky old person resistant to change, or that there might be other reasons it's a bad idea. For example, an actuator is required, which makes the mechanical design significantly more complicated. With smart switches costing $60+ each, I would think there would be space in the market for such a thing, but maybe I'm wrong.

Anyway, what I'm asking for is an old-fashioned interface on the wall switch, but with smart features. Mostly, this means a separate remote control (to add a 3-way switch rather than deal with awkward wiring issues in an old house). Other features - timer, motion sensing, phone control - would be nice as well, but not as important.",garblesnarky,/r/smarthome/comments/f2iysi/are_there_any_smart_light_switches_that_replicate/,7,smarthome,40

I have purchased a new home and it will be built over the next several months. The builder is open to customizations and one thing I am trying to think about is if I should ask for any kind of low voltage (~12V DC) wiring into the window sill for smart blinds so that I can install my own down the road. The smart blinds are something I would rather DIY for the most part, and I'm not sure if getting power routed is worth it with the new Ikea smart blinds that are battery operated. It's hard to find out more about other vendors as they usually provide a complete service. Maybe I won't end up putting in any smart blinds right now (I like Ikea's blinds but I don't want their blackout curtains, want to allow some light through) but do you thinking routing power wires in is worth it or should I expect future products to just use battery power?

f2z22g,1581545186,Home renovation: Which wall dimmers to get?,"Hi there,

I've been experimenting with home automation using Home Assistant for a while now. For lighting I have quite a few Hue bulbs in my appartment.

Soon, we'll be moving to a 7 bedroom home. The house will need a lot of remodelling. Since all wall switches need to be replaced, I figured I should replace them with smart dimmers. That way I won't need to equip my entire new house with Hue bulbs (which would be quite a bit beyond budget).

Unfortunately all the options are quite confusing, which is why I'm asking for help: Which built-in dimmer switches would you recommend to install in my new home? I don't have a preference for Zigbee or Z-Wave, I just want to make the best choice going forward.

Your advice is greatly appreicated!

f2zuha,1581548263,"I've been trying to find an answer as to how easy it is to entirely isolate two different home automation systems on one network, while retaining control of one only for myself.","Maybe I'm phrasing it wrong or not using the search times in google and on here correctly, but let me open with my situation, but I haven't been able to find anyone else trying to do this, or how well it could even work.

I live with three roommates in a house. I want control over smart plugs and smart lights only in my room. I don't really utilize the communal areas, so I have zero incentive to link my room's automation to their automation. But I also don't want them messing with my system. Be it by accident, or as a practical joke of some kind.

So is there any way I can use my own hub, my own “separate smart home” that maybe needs a password to even join? (The other perk being, should I ever move, I get to take that with me.)

That way I can fine tone my lighting controls from one hub (probably my phone). I've been using those TP link switches with ok results, but it's really just a simple on/off situation. I want more control that that offers me.

If relevant, they've gone with the Phillips home automation ecosystem. I've considered using the same, but wouldn't be opposed to using a different one, especially if it made my goal easier to achieve.

The closest thing I've found to a solution for this was someone who used bluetooth based only smart-plugs, but that seemed to be a very limiting ecosystem he was in, lacked the robustness of others on the market.",Karbankle,/r/homeautomation/comments/f2zuha/ive_been_trying_to_find_an_answer_as_to_how_easy/,2,homeautomation,5

Things that the system needs to do:

* Video intercom/buzz someone in at the front gate from multiple locations in the home
* Control the deadbolts and electric strike locks on the doors (either replace cylinders with smart ones or mount key-turning box on inside of door)
* Allow codes to be distributed which can open the gate/doors (for airbnb, deliveries, etc...). These codes should only work at specific times or for a specific amount of uses.
* Alternatively to the keypads, allow keyfobs or rfid-cards to open the doors

I am myself highly technical (I have a linux server serving websites in my basement, several of which I wrote a bunch of code for).

One of my kids is \*not\* into computers/coding under normal circumstances, because she has no interest in things that don't affect the real world, but she's pretty excited by the idea of home automation.

Many of the things we want to do (like, for example, have the lights slowly come on in the morning for wakeup time) are probably things that we could get software that just \*does that\* with a few button presses, but what I'd like to do is use this as an excuse to teach her a bit about how computers actually work, since she's surrounded by them in her life.

So, I guess my question is, is there a half-way point between ""tap buttons on I dunno the Hue app or something"" and ""write a bunch of Python or whatever""?  Something that makes the computer's decision making process visible without having to learn to code for real?

* Amp / receiver should be a smaller form factor / preferably mountable in some way. 
* Have the amp / receiver capable of Alexa and Airplay 2 integration. 
* Preferable to have Alexa default output set to the amp. e.g. you don't need to say ""Alexa play stuff in room A"" - if you are already in Room A with an echo in it, saying ""Alexa play song"" will automatically play the song in Room A's ceiling speakers. 
* All rooms need to be able to operate independently. 
* Volume to be controlled by the source of the sound (e.g. iphone, spotify etc). Dont want it dial-only control  of the sound.

After some research there are a couple of options that sort of satisfy the criteria. 


* Sonos AMP  (I believe checks all boxes)
* Denon PMA-150H /  Denon DRA-800H (not sure if can be set as Alexa's default speaker)
* Marantz NR1200 (Not sure if we can set it to Alexa's default speaker)

I have several lights (and other simple on/off devices) set up in the google home app so that they can be switched on/off by saying ""hey google, turn on the lamp"" or ""hey google, turn off the fan"" and so on. Primarily for me, everything is android, but I also have a work iphone and I'm finding that I have this to hand more and more frequently these days. 

I don't have an apple hub or whatever apple use for home automation, nor am I going to get one, but I have set up quick switches on my iphone for all the devices by installing google assistant for iOS and then setting up the shortcuts app to issue the relevant command to google assistant. It works very well for turning lights on and off remotely especially when I don't want to shout so the nearest google home device can hear me. 

It occured to me to today that I could half the number of custom shortcuts if I could find a voice command that made google assistant change the status of the on/off device in question. In other words, the same verbal command will switch the light on if it's off and off if it's on. I've tried ""hey google toggle the light"", ""...switch the light"", ""...activate the light"", ""...change the light"". I'm starting to think it can't be done, but maybe I missed something obvious? 

Just out of interest, ""activate"" will turn it on but it won't turn it off, ""toggle"" will turn it off but won't turn it on. And if I recall correctly, switch and change commands just sent me to a google search.

I like the GE Smart Wave switches, although I could be easily convinced that another product is a better fit. The prices I’m seeing are approximately $35 / $30 / $20 / $34 per device for dimmer / standard / add-on / fan control. I have a total switch count of 55, so the cost could be substantial. I also want to add maximum value to the home, and if a full implementation doesn’t add significant value, I might not be as inclined to do one.

f3koo2,1581644100,Trouble connecting globe smart bulbs,"I switched IP’s this week and have run into an issue with my Globe smart bulbs (model 34213, full RGB and white). I am unable to connect them regardless of mode (basic and AP). I have reached out to Globe and they have been doing their best, but figured I would ask all of you if you have had similar issues. 

So, I switched IP’s and ended up removing the bulbs profile from the app as I could no longer connect to them. I went to go and connect with them through the app but they just won’t connect. I have tried both basic and AP modes but have had no luck. I’ve cleared my apps cache as well as restarted my router. 

When I go through basic connection, nothing connects and I have to go and retry. When I enter AP mode, after I switch to the bulbs hotspot and go back into the app, the bulbs switch out of pairing mode and my phone goes right back to my home WiFi. 

Before anyone asks, I am trying to pair them on the 2.4 GHz network, not the 5.

I was hoping someone could help me out. I've recently upgraded to a 3.1 surround sound system, with a coming 5.1 in what I like to think is a relatively smart home.

I saw some great reviews on the Logitech Harmony, so I picked up the Harmony Elite, thinking it would be able to solve setting lights, scenes, and going from 4 remotes down to 1, and also being able to control things like a Phillips hue setup and Ecobee.

Unfortunately, it looks like I'm only able to control the receiver and the TV through the remote, minus the two buttons I can assign for the hue.

I don't want to yell at Alexa, and I'd love to be able to set buttons to change light settings, etc when using the Harmony, but it seems impossible.

f3ssxz,1581689948,GH/Alexa vs smart based solutions,"Hello,  


I'm thinking about automating my flat a little bit:  
\- install smart lights (to be able to dim light, turn it on/off, change color to filter out blue light at evening)  
\- install smart power outlet (e.g. to be able to turn dehumidifier and fan on and off)  
\- be able to use my not so smart tv is smart way (e.g. tell ""Google/Alex, turn on Grand Tour on Amazon Prime)

\- install some sensors (mostly for fun), like e.g. temp and humidity sensor

\- maybe install one wifi camera  


I'd also like to be able to:  
\- steer everything using Google/Alexa assistant: e.g. tell google to dim light, to turn on smart power outlet (by saying e.g. ""turn on dehumidifier"" instead of saying ""turn on power outlet 1"")

\- be able to access live stream from my camera from my mobile (e.g. by saying ""ok google, show me stream from living room camera"")  
\- automate a bit more complex (but not extremely complex) actions - sample automation: ""if humidity sensor detects that humidity in bathroom is above 60% then turn on dehumidifier for 20 minutes or less if humidity reaches 50% earlier""  


I started doing research and seems that must have for me is one of smart assistant devices (e.. google home mini or amazon echo dot)  


Also I think that it should be easier if I add some smart hub - I was thinking about [hass.io](https://hass.io) as I aready have raspberry PI and I'm software developer, so configuring and scripting shouldn't be an issue  


I have few questions:

About solution with no smart hub (just Google Home Mini/Amazon Echo Dot):  
1. Do I understand correctly that if I don't have smart hub I'm still able to e.g. control smart bulls, smart power outlets etc, but it uses integration of those devices mobile app with Google Home app - so I end up having tons of separate apps on my phone (for Philips Hue, for TP Link Power Outlets etc)?  
2. So I won't be able to e.g. control my power outlets and light when my smartphone is turned off (e.g. using Echo Dot or Google Home Mini)?

About solution with Home Assistant:  


3. How does smart hub ([hass.io](https://hass.io), smartthings etc) integrate with google/alexa: I would e.g. like to be abe to use google/alexa assistant as usual (so e.g. to be able to tell ""ok google, play Peaky Blinders on Netflix on Chromecast""), but on the other also to be able to use it with devices connected to smart hub, so e.g. tell google ""ok google, dim lights in my lliving room"".",mck159,/r/homeautomation/comments/f3ssxz/ghalexa_vs_smart_based_solutions/,1,homeautomation,1

f3tobr,1581693874,What else can I automate?,"I've been quickly building a smart home for the last few months since I moved into my current home. I  currently can do the following through either app control or voice control (all via Google Home/Google Assistant):

* Turn on and off all of the lights in the house using smart switches, including a few non-smart dimmers which have IR controls
* Fully control all of the TV's and the XBOX
* Fully control the thermostat
* Lock and Unlock the door
* Arm the security system
* Get alerts when the gate to the front yard is opened (Push Notifications and Voice Alerts on all speakers)

I'm looking for the next thing to automate in the house which doesn't require a huge investment. I don't have a garage, and I'm anti-opening my blinds for any reason (we like our neighbors outside, not inside). The house is a 2-story house, so we opted not to get a robotic vacuum. My goal is to automate things in a way which maintains ""normal"" usability for people who don't know about / understand / want to use the smart functionality (like my mother).

I'm attempting to upgrade a standard single pole switch that currently operates two porch lights and replace it with a Kasa HS200, which Kasa's web site says is possible. I also upgraded the gang box to give me more room, but when I tried connecting everything, it doesn't work and trips the breaker. I have 5 romex cables coming into this gang box. I think only one of them supplies power from the breaker, although I haven't tested the 12/3 cable that I assume is connected to the switch on the other side of the wall.

f492zb,1581771509,"Suggestions for next ""smart"" project","I've been quickly building a smart home for the last few months since I moved into my current home. I currently can do the following through either app control or voice control (all via Google Home/Google Assistant):

* Turn on and off all of the lights in the house using smart switches, including a few non-smart dimmers which have IR controls
* Fully control all of the TV's and the XBOX
* Fully control the thermostat
* Lock and Unlock the door
* Arm the security system
* Get alerts when the gate to the front yard is opened (Push Notifications and Voice Alerts on all speakers)

I'm looking for the next thing to ""smartify"" in the house which doesn't require a huge investment. I don't have a garage, and I'm anti-opening my blinds for any reason (we like our neighbors outside, not inside). The house is a 2-story house, so we opted not to get a robotic vacuum. My goal is to ""smartify"" things in a way which maintains ""normal"" usability for people who don't know about / understand / want to use the smart functionality (like my mother).

I'm not a huge fan of full-automation. Especially after posting this question to the r/homeautomation and getting a lot of very thoughtful but not really appealing responses. Basically, I like my automations to be semi-automatic. I like routines that do a lot of stuff, but I don't want them to trigger by themselves because I don't have any programmable parameters which are consistent enough to use for those automations. (For example, I don't want the entire house to shut down when I walk the dog).

I'm unable to replace any of the major appliances such as the refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher or laundry machines.

Any ideas what else I can do cheaply? By cheaply I mean ±$100 USD.

I should add that I do have a Smartthings V3 Hub available (so I can do Z-Wave/Zigbee), but most of my devices are currently on Wifi. I've mitigated the issue of slow wifi by having 2 Ubiquiti Access Points at strategic locations in the house, all connected to a Fortigate 80C (yes, it's older, but it works amazingly well). So I've got multiple SSID's with multiple VLANs, traffic filtration and even a network-wide PiHole to prevent ads from choking up my network.",htchief,/r/smarthome/comments/f492zb/suggestions_for_next_smart_project/,3,smarthome,13

I'm new to the whole smart home and automated home thing.. but I'm very interested to do more and purchase additional smart home items.

My girlfriend purchased me a number of smart devices for Christmas:

2 Meross rgbw colour changing lights (I use the term w in rgbw very loosely because the range of ""whites"" available aren't great and are more yellows and blues than warm and cool whites)

4 smart plugs - one of which is used for the phone chargers and works great when we're too lazy to go to the other room to switch it on, but still thinking of other practical locations for the other 3. I was hoping one of these could be connected to the kettle but the kettle has an on off toggle so doubt this will work. I'm open to suggestions as to how best to use these.

1 LED strip light - yet to be installed as we've just been too busy although I'm thinking tonight is the night and they'll be installed behind the TV.

Anyway back to the problem at hand.. when I ask Alexa to turn the lights on the living room lights default to red and I can't get this to change to one of the variations of white, I can change the colour in the app to one of their terrible versions of white but when we turn them off and back on again they go straight back to red (I think if I change the colour in the app to e.g. green this changes the default colour to green but it doesn't do it for white?)

f4dwtz,1581793321,Simple house-wide doorbell w/ Smartthings button + several Nest mini's?,"So I have a Samsung Smartthings hub, and bunch of zigbee and Z-wave lights and switches, as well as a Google Nest Mini in just about every room in the house. I control the lights with the cheap but effective Samsung buttons / a couple door sensors, or with voice commands to the Nest minis --“ok google turn on kitchen”.

This is just to illustrate that Google Home and the smartthings hub are talking to each other nicely.

Our house is 100+ years old, and does not have any infrastructure for a fancy doorbell like the Nest Hello, and I don’t really need or want that right now, anyway. I just need a usable doorbell. We are using an inexpensive wireless doorbell left here by the previous owner of the house. Problem is, it isn’t loud enough to be heard if we’re upstairs, or in the basement. I just need a simple way to use all my Nest Mini’s as a house-wide doorbell, and I feel like I am sooooo close you guys.

I have a spare Smartthings button that I am desperately trying to use as the doorbell. But I can’t figure out how to get it to trigger a google home broadcast -- “there is someone at the front door” -- when it is pressed.

A Google Home “routine” can only be initiated by a voice command, correct? There is no way I can make an Routine that is essentially “when the Smartthings doorbell button is pressed, broadcast this message”, correct?

Within the Smartthings app, I can easily make an automation such as “when doorbell button is pressed, send a push notification to all home members, and turn on this smart outlet”. I have a extra Samsung smart outlet, and was thinking I could somehow use that turning on as a trigger for the nest mini broadcast, but just like the button, Google Home seems to know Samsung z-wave/zigbee outlets and buttons exist, and it can turn them on and off, but it can't make a change in on/off status initiate some other action.

I then thought of using IFTTT, thinking surely an applet should be really easy to program, but alas come to find that google home is not in the IFTTT ecosystem. It seems like HomeAssistant.io could probably make it work, but ugh I don’t want to put that much effort (setting up a Rasberry Pi etc etc) to get a dang doorbell.

Really seems like this should be easy, and I’m running into a wall.

Finally, perhaps my best option might be [an idea I found here on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/aehoe9/google_home_as_doorbell_chime/). Basically, I load an mp3 of myself saying “Hey google, doorbell” into my existing cheap wireless doorbell, which is already very close to one of my nest minis. “hey google, doorbell” will trigger a house-wide broadcast on all the nest mini's, telling us the there is someone at the front door. One issue with this method is the delay -- probably about 4-7 seconds. Which isn't horrible granted....but man, as I said earlier, seems like this should be easy.

f4ic78,1581812058,Jumping off the deep end! Key tips for success?,"Hi everyone!

I am getting a brand new house this summer, and am going to be using it as an opportunity to create a smart home network. I have minimal experience in it, but enough peripheral knowledge that I think I can make work. What I'd love to hear are some thoughts on my initial plans, direction to helpful resources (specifically around Home Assistant and hardware), and overall feedback/tips.

What I am doing for sure:  
\- Google Home Assistant Mini in all the main rooms of the house  
\- Legrand Radiant Tru-Universal Dimmers on all light switches. No smart bulbs, but all are Dimmable 3500K LEDs.  
\- Raspberry Pi connected to Samsung Q80 smart TV that can stream games from my gaming PC, run Kodi, run Plex (although that's also built into the TV).  
\- Gemstone LED lighting around front perimeter of all soffits on the house ([https://gemstonelights.com/](https://gemstonelights.com/))  


What I am considering:  
\- Blink XT2 Cameras for both inside and outside monitoring  
\- Home Assistant as my software. This will be hosted off of either a Raspberry Pi or a server desktop that I currently have running for 2 minecraft servers  
\- Ubiquiti UniFi Access Point  UAP-PRO located in center roof of main floor and connected via Cat6 to the router (router will receive 1G up 1G down fiber)  
\- Z-wave sensors on all main doors and windows  
\- Samsung smart things Z-Wave hub, unless anyone can pitch me on another good one  
\- Honeywell WiFi Smart Thermostat (rather than Nest or something, as this one has ability to connect to and control the central humidifier on the furnace and communicate with air sensors outside)  
\- Possible PiHole/network switch  


My goals: 

I want to be able to set up full house configurations rather than have to app by app, and I don't think Google or Alexa can support this. What I mean is that I'd like to give a command such as ""Enter guest mode"" and have my gemstone lights turn on a warm welcoming configuration outside (preset of course), my music turn on, select lights dim, my thermostat raise/lower temperature, and alarms turn off. 

I'd also like to be able to have a central and easy way to use voice controls to execute commands over all z-wave devices and apps. Fun stuff such as having the thermostat lower the temperature after I leave the house and turn on when it sees that I am 10 minutes away from home would be great as well.

I don't have much experience, but I have played with linux servers before, have a bit of programming/scripting knowledge, and like to tinker.

What would be the best approach to slowly building this up? What are some tips with tackling Home Assistant?

f4jyau,1581819554,Is it possible to change Smartlife plug IP to a different VLAN without internet access? Need an energy monitoring smart plug with HA integration and no internet access requirement.,"I'm on a quest to find good, cheap smart plugs with energy monitoring that work out of the box with Home Assistant and don't need to connect to a cloud. My home network consists of two VLANs, one is my main VLAN and one is my IoT VLAN, and the IoT does not have internet or main VLAN access.

I have some TP-Link HS103/5s, and they work really good and integrate well into Home Assistant and don't need internet access, but they don't have energy monitoring (I'd definitely recommend them if you don't need energy monitoring). To try to get energy monitoring, I bought two different plugs to try that both work via Tuya/Smartlife, since they have an HA integration. However, it seems like they need constant cloud access, since when I change my phone over to the IoT VLAN I can't actually set up the plugs on the IoT network, I have to do it on my main VLAN. I tried to reserve an IP on the IoT VLAN for the plug as well from my network controller, that didn't work. Is it possible to change the plug's network/IP? If not  I'll return these and give up on Tuya/Smartlife.

If it's not possible, what are good smart plugs with energy monitoring that only take up one outlet space and don't need cloud access?",gckless,/r/homeautomation/comments/f4jyau/is_it_possible_to_change_smartlife_plug_ip_to_a/,1,homeautomation,4

f4moko,1581833747,SmartThings Zigbee sensor - precision and frequency of temperature [xpost from smartthings]," Hi,

I want to use some SmartThings sensors to measure temperature in an experiment that requires many wireless temp sensors. Three sensors in particular (the newer water leak, multipurpose contact, and motion sensors) all report temperature in addition to their intended usage. It looks like they're also Zigbee 3.0.

I couldn't find any datasheet on these sensors. How precise are they? I'd like to register a 0.5 degrees C change. If I use water or door sensor, do I need to actually have a water flood or contact open/close event for the temperature to be sent?

Or do they send out regular temperature updates? If so, how often? Or is it based on change? How much of a temperature change does it take for them to send out a temperature update?

If you have them, any particular issues with range, staying connected? Any relevant experience with them is appreciated.

f4s2ld,1581866801,Buyer beware Tado smart thermostats,"Hi all, as a preface, I’m a domestic and commercial heating installer, have been for a while.

The app looks great and it’s compatible with all the usual voice control systems, Siri, Alexa, google etc...

It’s best selling feature, the part which sets it aside from a £50 two zone programmer and thermostat setup, is geofencing. You leave the house, it turns down the heating, you come back home, and it warms it up ready for your arrival. All without ever having to open the app.

This feature is now behind a subscription based paywall. £4/month or £25/year. Did they let their registered installers know, of course not. Is that information clear on the website, nope.

They still class the system as having geofencing as when you leave the house you get a notification to push a button to shut off your heating. And again when you get home. Total crock of shit. Their customer services team have progressively gotten less helpful, more aggressive and less available throughout the years.

It’s a shame to say, but I would avoid them going forward. For that kind of money, you’re better off going with someone else.",Project4558,/r/homeautomation/comments/f4s2ld/buyer_beware_tado_smart_thermostats/,165,homeautomation,56

Hi guys - the prize you will win is my undying thanks.  LOL

Who knows what this board is?  I don't have any clearer photos of it.  I think it is some sort of alarm system board but don't know which one.  I need to find out where to buy another one.

It's currently rigged up in my vacation condo's attic and acts as an interrupt with a wireless door sensor on patio sliding doors.  When the patio doors are open, this unit shuts off the entire AC system.  When the door closes, the AC system immediately resumes.  The handyman who rigged this up has died since it was installed, and no one knows what it is.

Thanks for ANY leads.  Much love to the brainiest of Redditors.  ;)

f5eezx,1581968936,Help with thermostat compatibility?,"[This is the existing thermostat](https://i.imgur.com/qO1Iy0I.jpg)

[This is the wiring beneath the thermostat](https://imgur.com/a/fIwYMRY)

I rent a townhouse, and the complex management has given me the go-ahead to swap out the existing thermostat for a smart one (provided I don't damage any complex property, and replace it if/when I eventually move) -- but I don't know if the existing wiring is compatible with any of them. I did use the ""compatibility checkers"" of the ones I was interested in, and they yielded the following results:

* Honeywell: No-go, as I don't have a common wire.
* Nest: Compatible with both Nest and Nest E
* Ecobee: Compatible with Ecobee, Ecobee3 Lite, and Ecobee4 but all require a ""power extender kit.""
* Emerson: Compatible with Emerson Sensi, but not with the Sensi Touch

Before I buy one, though (leaning toward the Emerson because it's compatible with Alexa/Echo, Google Home, and SmartThings, all of which I use extensively), I'd like to see if I'm missing anything that might prove a hindrance to installation (like what I believe is called a ""jumper wire"" between the RH and RC?). 

Admittedly, I know nothing about furnaces or AC units (and yes, I absolutely do intend to pay someone qualified to install it) so I'd greatly appreciate any help or input (including recommendations with regards to which thermostat to go with! Ideally compatible with Alexa *and* SmartThings, but one *or* the other would be fine)",redredred_blue_,/r/homeautomation/comments/f5eezx/help_with_thermostat_compatibility/,5,homeautomation,6

I've also looked at the [Monoprice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SX626NH/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_qB8sEbBWZ0RFB) and [Qubino](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SX626NH/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_qB8sEbBWZ0RFB) units and they seem like they have the same issue.

My Zigbee stuff so far is Tradfri bulbs, switches and outlets, one Hue lamp, Aqara sensors, Gledopto LED controllers and relays.

The route I have chosen is to use wifi devices and MQTT wherever possible. So far this works great. Everything is controlled by my Raspberry Homeassistant, Node-Red and Mosquitto. LED-Strips are controlled with Quinleds, LED bulbs/Wall switches with Shellies+Tasmota. Environment sensors will be added to the Quinleds or onto separate ESP boards where necessary. For the outlets, I have found some tasmota-flashable devices as well.

Generally, replacing the mains-connected stuff is easy. But I have not yet found suitable replacements for the battery-powered Aqara sensors, mostly motion and door/window.

My idea is to use 433 or bluetooth devices and bridge them to MQTT with the help of some of my many ESP devices. This would take care of coverage. Or even better, use Wifi sensors if battery life permits.

Is that a viable strategy? And which such sensors are people having success with? I like the Aqara motion sensors a lot.

As a concrete example, I am running Home Assistant, a Trådfri gateway, an Android TV, two rokus, a Sonos beam (with two Symfonisk rears), a Canon multi function printer, a cricut maker, a NAS, a couple of computers, some sonoff (Tasmota) switches, a couple of tablets and a couple of phones...

So, the NAS, the computers, and the tablets should share space (or I have lots of firewall holes)...

The phones presumably go in the same network as the other user devices.

The printer should ideally be in there as well.  Even though that reaches out to the internet at times (it can email scans, it can order supplies when needed...)

The FBI would say that the switches and trådfri gateway belong in the iot segment, that would mean home assistant should be in there too for easier control. The TV, roku, Sonos and Symfonisk should presumably also sit in that segment.  But they also need access to the NAS for local media.  The phones, tablets and computers are used to control some of the devices in the iot segment...

I tried to search on the app store for maybe a Minoston specific app, but I didn't find one (they don't mention one anyways, but thought I'd try).

Does anyone know where/how I can get the double-tap scene setting to work? Has anyone used these before? What am I missing?",guapo131,/r/homeautomation/comments/f5wf55/minoston_z_wave_switch_double_tap_supposed_to/,1,homeautomation,2
f5wmkq,1582051889,Best smart lock?,"Hey folks,  


I'm looking to invest in a smart lock that has the following features:  


* Homekit compatibility
* Not keyless, but has a touch pad to enter PINs
* Ability to create new PINs within the respective app, as opposed to on the lock itself
* \*OPTIONAL\* auto lock / unlock feature?
* \*OPTIONAL\* Brass / gold color? :D  


I currently have the Schlage Connect Camelot - and although I think it's solid, it's lacking the flexibility to be used through HomeKit, or being able to modify PIN codes through any apps.

I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, and I keep odd hours for work, typically going to bed/sleep when the sun is out and waking up in the dark. I've tried the super loud alarm clocks with bed rumblers. I've tried setting 5 alarms in a row. I've tried having (now ex-)girlfriends come and wake me up when the alarm goes. Doesn't matter, I sleep through them all. I also played with Sleep As Android for a while, having myself solve math problems and scan QR codes posted in the bathroom to shut the alarms off, but eventually even my sleepy brain figured out it was easier to go into Android settings and kill the app from the system menu to shut it off so I could go back to sweet dreamland and not get out of bed. I also tried using my Google Home for an alarm, but eventually she learned that when I grumbled ""gah guggle sterp me lerrm"" that it meant stop the alarm.

I'm declaring war on my morning self.

So now I'm combining several different things into one. I have a variety of alarms and such set. I have smart plugs to turn on a spot light (ok, an Ikea lamp) that's pointed straight at my bed. The only thing missing is the QR code scanning to make me actually get up and walk to another part of the house. Is there a command to incorporate this feature into a Google Home routine? Or is this something I need to implement with ITTT (I've never used it, so some guidance there would be appreciated)?

&gt;  
&gt;They only support 2.4ghz which Google WiFi has but it combines both 2.4 and 5ghz together and let's the device choose. My phone does not let me choose bands and is stuck on 5ghz so when I want to set up my sonoff and it piggybacks my phone's wifi settings it gets mad and says 5ghz not supported. How can I work arround this?

I had the same issue with my samsung smartthings wifi mesh hub running plume software. no way to force 2.4ghz in the app. **Plume support page has a solution that actually works:**

[https://support.plume.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011596233-My-device-is-only-compatible-with-2-4-GHz-networks](https://support.plume.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011596233-My-device-is-only-compatible-with-2-4-GHz-networks)  
(*Method 2 worked for me!)*

**Method 2 (Android 7 or higher)**

1. Download and install [Wifi Analyzer by Farproc](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer) and the [Wifi Connector Library](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.connecter) (both free) on your Android device
2. Forget your Plume network on you Android device
3. Open Wifi Analyzer and swipe right until you get to the AP List page.You will see several pods broadcasting on different bands
4. Long-press on the strongest one broadcasting on a 2.4 GHz channel (1,6,11) and choose **Connect.**
5. Enter the Wi-Fi password and your phone will now be connected on 2.4 GHz
6. Use the smart device App to setup your smart device.
7. Once the device is connected, forget the network on your Android device and set it up again using the normal method.

\-monitor and adjust thermostat controls

\- Lock must be able to work OFF of wifi. There is no wifi in the complex community room. Are there locks that have keypads, but can also use an app with phone blue-tooth to work? Or something similar?

Any recommendations would be very appreciated. If we can't find a smart lock that will work for us, then we will likely have to remove the room for community use unless it's reserved, where we would then open it up with a key.

f6f90u,1582137987,Homekit and IFTTT compatible wireless temperature sensor? (Hue?),"I need help please with DIY automation to mitigate a near 15-degree difference between my baby son's bedroom and our living room where our only thermostat is.

Here's the problem

* We have one 1st Generation Nest Thermostat in our cavernous living room, which our HVAC struggles to heat in winter and cool in summer.  The one thermostat controls the whole house in one go
* Our son's room is closer to the HVAC and gets full force of heat in winter and AC in summer, so can be \~15 degrees too hot or cold compared to what Nest in living room says.
* So what I want is a way to monitor the temperature in my son's room as the master to control the HVAC, and everyone else in the house can survive with sweaters, blankets and fans!
* I have an Apple Homepod and a few other homekit products in the house. I don't want to use an Alexa or Google Home. I know they might integrate more nicely, but I don't want those guys in my home!

What I've considered/tried

* Adding a nest temp sensor to son's room.  Unfortunately not compatible with my 1st gen Nest thermostat
* Upgrade nest thermostat to latest and add temp sensor to son's room. Sounds most elegant, but expensive and wasteful of otherwise functioning old thermostat
* Adding smart vents from Keen Home. It sucked, never worked and I returned it.
* Add a different temp sensor of any make, that can connect via wifi and run integration to turn nest on and off via IFTTT

I found this article [https://www.imore.com/best-homekit-temperature-sensors](https://www.imore.com/best-homekit-temperature-sensors) which suggests a few options.  Of these, the Hue motion sensor seems compelling, since I will likely get some Hue lights soon anyway, so don't mind buying the hub.  What is not clear, is whether the temp sensor in this Hue device can be accessed via IFTTT and be used to trigger the Nest.

So in summary, my questions are:

1. Does anyone know if the Hue device could be used in this way?
2. Can anyone suggest a different product combo to solve my problem?
3. Is it likely that just upgrading the main Nest to a new one, and getting the extra temp sensor is so much easier that it's worth paying for?

Even stranger, if power is cut during a rapid series of constant changes(Multiple per second), it doesn't appear to remember anything that happened during that set.

f6u64x,1582210429,Router failure or too many devices?,"I've owned a TP-LINK Archer C7 AC1750 for a couple years, and from what I can tell it's still supposed to be a pretty decent router.

Lately, I have to restart it every couple days or so. Most of my smart home devices are connected to the 2.4GHz network, and for some reason that one just crashes periodically. The 5GHz network remains operational, but the 2.4 is nowhere to be found. After a restart, all works fine for 24-48 hours.

Anyway, is this due to a hardware failure or am I just trying to run too many devices at once? The 2.4Ghz channel has a few Google Nest Home Minis, 4 Wemo Minis, a Nest thermostat, Nest Hello, Nest front door lock, 3 Nest Protects, a couple Logitech Circles, and MyQ Garage door opener. I also have a couple dozen Lutron Caseta switches and Sonos speakers on this router, but they're hardwired and then running their own mesh networks. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

first of all, I would like to point out that I am a complete beginner on this topic and still trying to learn as quick as possible. I also might forget to add important information for this question which I will provide asap, so sorry about that :D

My Project

I am trying to create a Wifi connection from my arduino NodeMCU v3, which has a Co2 Sensor connected to it. As a Powersource I want to use a simple Powerbank. The sensor will send measurment data every second to my laptop. First I tried it with an Arduino Leonardo connected to my Laptop via USB. With Arduino IDE I was able to see the sensors measurements. 

The Problem

With the NodeMCU it does not work for me. I was searching for ways to do it and installed MQTT Mosquitto and tried the publish/subscribe method to get the data over wifi. For this I installed the ESPMQTTCLIENT Library as well as the PubSubClient Library. I got some help with the code and theoretically only needed to add my Servers IP adress my SSID and the network password.

this is the result:  

21:27:41.626 -&gt; Connecting to (SSID)

21:27:42.200 -&gt; .......

21:27:45.983 -&gt; WiFi connected

21:27:45.983 -&gt; IP address: 

21:27:45.983 -&gt; (localhost)

21:27:46.971 -&gt; AmbiMate sensors: 4 core + CO2 

21:27:46.971 -&gt; AmbiMate Firmware version 2.8

21:27:46.971 -&gt; Attempting MQTT connection...failed, rc=-2 try again in 5 seconds

21:27:57.106 -&gt; Attempting MQTT connection...failed, rc=-2 try again in 5 seconds

*(………….never ending loop)*

&amp;#x200B;

When I connect to my localhost i get the above result. But when I connect to an online broker for example: [broker.mqtt-dashboard.com](https://broker.mqtt-dashboard.com) its working fine. 

Does anyone know how to deal with this issue?

Hello,

I want to share here my mirror that is showing date, time, wheater, news and in the future some more info like agenda, traffic etc..

The mirror i used, is a see trough mirror with an aluminium frame designed to hold almost any smartphone or tablet in any position you like.

The goal was to find a new use for old smartdevices that are currently dusting away in many drawers at people homes.

How it works:

* Take your old smartphone or tablet and go to the web app i designed for this
* Mount your old device behind the mirror
* Take your daily driver phone or something else (tablet, laptop, pc etc..), go to the same web app and link your device with a unique code to your old device that is behind the mirror
* Enable the modules that you want to show on your mirror

Not only you saved your devices from slowly dying, you now also have a cool mirror..

Because of the many postive responses, i decided to create a kickstarter project for it and hopefully, one day, i can make my job of building these mirrors :)

I'm not very experienced in home automation, but I'm a linux administrator :). 
I am searching for a button, from the design like the philipps hue button or amazon dash, which triggers a custom action (opening the door via doorbird api), most likely via a script on my raspberry pi. 
It should not have the need for a bridge or third device, as I most likely will only have this one button, therefor I don't need/want a fullblown solution.

I guess the communication with the raspi will be via bluetooth or directly WLAN? It would also be feasable to attach an extra adapter to it like a zigbee sniffer if needed, but bluetooth would be prefered :)

It needs to be available in europe :)

Is there anything on the market fullfilling these requirments right now? The problem while researching was that of course every manufacturer thinks only in his world and doesn't care what you want, therefor its hard to get information on customizability.

If you could point me in the right direction I would be grateful.

f7ezgt,1582308296,"Mega ""getting started"" thread","[Updated [repost](https://old.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/9xfccf/mega_getting_started_thread/)]

So, I've done a [mega review post](https://old.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/99q9yk/my_personal_reviews_mega_thread/), but about time for my mega ""getting started"" thread.

First off, I wanna just get out of the way that there are as many approaches to doing ""smart home"" as there are people doing it... So I welcome comments! The idea is to create a single post/thread I (or, for that matter, anyone else) can just link for people asking the basic question of ""where do I start"", and... I started where I started, not where everyone else started :-)

[**What do you** ***want*****?**]

My first suggestion to all those starting out or barely in.... At a minimum, consider EVERYTHING you might want to do. Let your imagination run wild. If you can think it, there's a good chance someone else has done it. I think the biggest and most common mistake people make when starting out - and it's true for me as well - is a lack of imagination. There's nothing wrong starting out with ""I *just* want to do X"" (especially if you mean it) but it's also a good way to get boxed in. I recommend everyone, including automation veterans, write out all your dream projects and goals... actually *write them down*. Write out what and how many devices (lights, sensors, etc.) it will take. Then, put in ball park prices. If you're really just starting out, you might need to pencil in just wild guesses. That's fine. Doesn't need to be exact, and prices change (and can vary wildly by brand/model). The idea is to just have a rough estimate of what's feasible and what isn't... What's worth it and what isn't... What to do sooner and what to put off.

[**What do you already have?**]

If you're serious about home automation... Make a detailed floor plan of your house. Actually, if you seriously own a house or are a long-term occupant of a residence -- make a floor plan. Mark where everything is at... Standard switches and lights, normal sockets, smart devices, and sensors. Also, mark out which circuit breaker they're all on (may not help with your home automation, but it's still very handy to have). This doesn't need to be day-one, but despite being a lot of work, it will be very useful in many ways. And worst case scenario, you'll add value to your house. (I use Sweet Home 3D - free, pretty powerful, and pretty easy.)

Obviously, what you already have for automation devices should be taken into account in any smart home plan. However, in general don't let that influence you too much. Home automation is constantly evolving, so be willing to occasionally rethink your approach. If you do switch to a different platform/protocol/etc, do it slowly. Don't try to transition everything at once.

[**What** ***can*** **you do?**]

See below for a quick list of the most common device types. Following that is a list of automation ideas. Use these to assist in making the list, and I will try to edit it to be fairly comprehensive, but please imagine the possibilities. Come up with your own dream list! (Then share it.)

But before I give those, there's a two things you need to decide early on. Honestly, I'm split on which is more important. They may very well be equally important.

[Pause for dramatic cliff-hanger....]

[**How are you going to control everything?**]

The first is the ""automation controller"". You've heard of Google Home and Alexa - maybe even IFTTT - and you're wondering if you really need a separate controller. Or maybe you've been under the impression Home and Alexa were the Alpha and Omega of smart homes. If you're going to do more than couple of simple things...  you're going to want a controller. It's just that simple.

There's quite a few out there, from those that barely qualify as an automation controller (like Google Home), to easy to use but limited SmartThings, to DIY systems like HomeAssistant. Personally, I use a Hubitat Elevation, and I love it. But... which is best depends in large part on end goals and user preference (and mon-ay!). Few people have used all of the major ones, so take all suggestions - including mine - with a grain of salt, unless they can directly compare and contrast from experience. So, you're on your own. For what it's worth, my quick-pick short list would be either Hubitat or Home Assistant, but it really does depend on your tech level, budget, goals, and other preferences.



Note: Especially if you're wracked by indecision,  SmartThings is pretty good and affordable way to get your feet wet, but they've said they're going to discontinue it ~~any day now~~ ~~soon~~ ~~some day~~ maybe (it's been four years since I got the email saying it *is* happening).

~~Note: I used to suggest SmartThings (Classic) as a good system for a mildly serious beginner, but IMO the new version is all but useless.~~

[**How are** ***you*** **going to control everything??**]

The second major decision is how you want to control the lighting. Sounds simple, but it's really not. It really deserves a mega-thread of it's own. At least for me, it was a choice that was far more difficult, far more costly, and far harder to reverse than which controller to get (though I'm proud to say I'm sure I did make the right choice for my goals). Different people do different things, and it's often necessary to mix-and-match, and there's a lot of different circumstances. There's smart switches,^1 smart bulbs, smart switches *with* smart bulbs, control/touch screen panels, remote controls, and voice. And, each one can have varying features and styling. I'm a huge fan of Lutron Caseta and Pico, but they do have some downsides. And so do all the other methods and brands. So, first, imagine yourself in your smart home.... How do you picture yourself turning on the lights on and off? Where will the switches be? What will they do? What are you going to do with the existing switches? Will you want switches where there aren't any built-in?

Many people answer ""I'll just use voice"". Wrong answer. Just take my word for it. Voice is an add-on feature; not a replacement for physical controls. (I have at least 10 Google Homes scattered throughout the house, and will be expanding on that - but for the most part, it's pretty rare for anyone in the house to use them.) Personally, my ultimate answer is that I want the lights to turn on by themselves, at the level I want based on time and activity (using motion sensors and schedules, while accounting for prior and current actions). Unfortunately, that's not a complete answer for three reasons... 1) Motion sensors can be finicky and you'll want a backup, 2) Motion een fed

* Aquarium temperature alerts

* Aquarium or other light cycling through colors and brightness all day

* Aquarium cloud shadow or lightning effects by weather (best with addressable LEDs)

* Aquarium auto-filling by level (using a water sensor - be sure to have backups in place for catastrophic leaks!)

* Pool auto-filling by level (using a float with a contact sensor - be sure to have backups in place for catastrophic failure!)

* Pool pump timer (possibly accounting for temperature and/or rain)

* Water heater timer (allowing weekends, holidays, etc., as opposed to ""dumb"" timers)

* Water heater always on when home (perhaps combined with timer - ""if home AND between X and Y o'clock"" or ""if home OR between X and Y oclock"")

* Water heater turns on when temperature rapidly drops (eg regardless of schedule, turn it on if *actually used*)

* Have bathtub temperature and/or level preset with auto-shutoff (and alert when full)

* No-touch toilet flushing and/or sink faucets

* Carbon monoxide levels trigger whole house and/or ceiling fans (and/or cut off furnace, open garage door, vent fans, alerts/alarm)

* Monitor power usage of outlets

* Fancy holiday lighting and patterns

* Audio broadcasts (eg ""Dinner time"", ""Bed time"", ""Take your medication"", singing Happy Birthday, etc. - can be combined with buttons)

* Audio broadcasts/text alerts for maintenance (eg AC filter, car registration renewal)

* Disable/enable WiFi/internet access to devices by schedule or other event (eg disable kids' phone at ""Dinner time"", could be combined alert mentioned above)

* Text alert for power outage

* Schedule sprinklers/irrigation

* Activate sprinklers/irrigation based on temperature and/or soil moisture

* Motion based animal deterrence (eg alarm or activate robotic scarecrow)

* Secret buttons (eg motion sensor in a book to retract a wall revealing a massive bunker filled with guns, with optional bunker filled with guns)

* Fun buttons doing... whatever (like squishy toys, the Big Red Button, or the internet box - note: do not put a button on your shoe, because that's stupid)

If you've made it all the way here, lemme know if you want something closer to a step-by-step instructions of getting a ""smart home"" using a Hubitat. I don't like telling people ""do this"" when there are so many different ways, and I'm nowhere near done with my way, but with enough interest I might be convinced.

I've bound the bulbs and the switches to hass.io and everything's working there, but when I press the switch buttons it cuts power to the bulbs so they disconnect.

I was hoping that once the switches were 'bound' this default action wouldn't happen and I could instead have the button tell the hue bulb to turn off via a hass.io action.

Is this possible? Is there a way to re-flash the switch firmware if it's not built in?

The switches have a blue light on all the time - does this mean they're not correctly bound?

A couple years ago, a bought some cheap emylo wifi relays that wire into your devices. I have had 0 issues with them, and I got a couple of three packs for 22 dollars each. They're super easy to wire up, all you have to do is cut the cord on your device, strip both sides of both ends and clip in the wires. In the mean time it has saved me money and time in the following ways.

1) they're cheaper than smart plugs but do the same fucking thing just as well. 

2) they're easier to move around. Just unplug and plug in the device as you normally would

3) my wife wanted a smart desk fan. So I bought her a normal one and wired this in.

4) I wanted to start the coffee pot with my alarm and routines, so I bought a cheap amazon Basics coffee pot with the actual hardware on off switch instead of a button. Spent 20 bucks on a smart coffee pot instead of 100.

5) I have a TV that uses the same remote as the one in my living room, and will occasionally turn on when I turn on the tv in my living room. So instead of having to go in to the kitchen to turn it off, inhave a routine set up to power cycle it when that happens (may have saved me from buying a whole ass new tv because it drove me up the fucking wall)

6) wife wanted a fancy growlight for her succulents (we live in the northwest, not much sun in the winter.) with a timer. I took an old floor lamp out of the attic and set it up with this relay and she set up a timer on that. Saved me like 30. 

7) she likes to leave the toaster unplugged when not in use. (This is a little over the top, dont judge me.) I put a door sensor on the little springy thing that turns it on, and a wifi relay. So when I push it down, the door sensor senses that the ""door"" was closed and turns on the switch.

Looking to get into the home automation world.  I thought I'd be clever, set up home assistant on my home servers (I am a devops nerd so tech doesn't bother me), and get a zwave usb and start zwaving like its hot...

Fast forward to today, where my house built in 1935 proved to be a blocker.  I had a switch that was going bad, so I ordered an Innovelli red switch to replace it.  After 20 minutes of realizing a&gt; I do indeed not have a neutral in the box that is easily usable (Rather, there is one, but its buried in a electrical tape wrapped bundle of cloth wrapped wiring coming out of a bx going to an outlet below it... I am not touching that with a 6 foot pole.) and b&gt; The smart switch is too deep/fat to fit in the switch box because of said mess of wiring.  For giggles though, I wired it up temporarily just to see it work and found that the dimmer does not behave well with my cheap 99 cent store LEDs in there. All in all, a wasted afternoon. Rather disappointed, and since my switch was arcing and on the way out, I went to the local store and picked up an 8 dollar manual switch. :) 

I am back to square 1, except I have a useless zwave switch, an unused HA install monitoring my adt pulse system and its motion / door sensors, and... no ability to do anything with it. 

I went with a switch because my family are generally technosaurs.  The concept of electrons flowing to provide power is alien technology to them.  Keeping a switch option would make things 1000 times better.  

So... What are my options here?  I know the recommendation is generally smart bulbs, but I like the idea of having a physical switch still as well.  My kid will never learn to yell ""alexa"" for example. :) . Smart bulbs need to be powered, so turning off the switch kills the bulbs.  

Ultimately, I am asking for a unicorn I know. Old brittle cloth wrapped BX wiring generally missing neutrals or inaccessible that  I am terrified to touch much, a non technical family, and some physical switches that need a functioning equivalent that would work with a smart solution.

Looking to make my home smart with a few things. I am new to things like scripting, hubs if needed, and ifttt related things but I definitely want to learn. I am mainly looking to do the following: 

- automate my front door buzzer: 
I think I can mainly do this with switchbot from what I’ve found, unless there’s a better option. I think I need the hub as well to control it from outside my home. I also know that switch bot doesn’t click the button and return to the start position unless you tell it I think so I would like to automate an auto off as well for the door buzzer. 
I would also like to tie this in with google home or Alexa. 

- automate window air conditioner on/off based on a temperature sensor:
I think I could do this with a couple WiFi outlets and maybe a WiFi temperature sensor for each area? I want to be able to control the “always on” older air conditioners so I can conserve energy. Ideally I could tie this in with location functionality on my phone so it checks my location and can figure out when I’m close to home/on my way home so it starts automatically before I get home. 

- smart electric bulbs:
Recommendations in general. Cost effective ones that work well. Dimmable warm/cool functionality would be nice. I saw some feit electric ones at Costco recently and I’ve considered etekcity from amazon but feedback on either or different bulbs would be nice.

For AV automation we are yet to finalize from Crestron, Control 4 or others.

The building is still in construction phase.

Please guide me for below mentioned queries:

1) Which one to choose; KNX vs Lutron
2) Crestron vs Control 4
3) Should we go for Zigbee/Z wave based home automation? How reliable are they

Budget is not an issue here but the solution should be highly durable and ease of functionality should be priority.",psr7185,/r/homeautomation/comments/f87m6o/automation_for_a_multi_storey_building/,0,homeautomation,3

f8t8ln,1582559781,(Q) Convert Dumb Puck Lights to Smart,"I have two sets of under-cabinet puck lights in my kitchen. They are controlled via an IR remote and rely on the remote to turn on/off and switch colors. 

 [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PXPJV9M/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o05\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PXPJV9M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) 

Unfortunately these do not work with a smart plug since when power is cut, the lights turn off and when power is restored, the lights remain off. The puck lights use a proprietary connection system so I don't have the ability to plug them into a smart wifi-controller. All of the obvious options are a no-go! The pucks are plugged into a standard wall outlet that is not controlled by a switch. As you can see from the link, the power cable goes from the outlet into the ""command puck"" via a special connector. The IR receiver is in the ""command puck"" so presumably the ""command puck"" contains all the circuitry to turn the system on/off and change the color, brightness, tempo, etc. There isn't a clean way to bypass the ""command puck"" by plugging the regular pucks into the power brick. Plus, i doubt it'd even turn on if i plugged it in like that.

I see a few options for a possible solution:

1. Logitech Harmony Hub to IR blast the little IR receiver. The problem with this is that LOS will be tricky. I wouldn't know for sure whether this will work until I spent the money on the hub and tried it out. 
2. Plug it into a smart dimmer plug and keep it at 1% until I want it fully on. (Not really a great option since it'll probably kill the pucks quicker and it'll run up my energy bill!)
3. Chop up the wires going to the ""command puck"" and see if it can be inserted into a smart connector. This isn't great since if it doesn't work, i'll have to buy a new package!
4. Buy a whole new system. Obviously I'd rather not do this since I JUST put these up and they are PERFECT minus this one flaw.

About to embark on a bathroom remodel and wanted to get people's opinions on getting the electrical items working properly with Home Assistant. I recently went to a friend's house and thought the lighting system he had was amazing ([https://imgur.com/a/BhKtYCl](https://imgur.com/a/BhKtYCl)). Totally customized and scene set Lutron system. Each wall switch was simply a CAT5 cable back to his server closet and into a massive bank of transformers programmed with Crestron. That's so out of budget it's not even an option. Do you guys no of ANY smart light switches that work with Home Assistant that are foolproof and able to be used by guests similar to the link? While I have a few @InovelliUSA dimmers, there is no way a guest is going to know triple click to get fan and mirror lights on and I really don't have room for 5 light switches.

In addition to the lighting, I must be able to control the following through Home Assistant and a, hopefully, simple switch(es), so I am grateful for recommendations:

f8y2uj,1582578073,Looking for high CRI light bulbs tunable across color temperature spectrum without a smart hub,"I have issues with light sensitivity which cause my eyes to get irritated, watery, and make me squint in light that is not diffused. If I walk into a typical retail market with open downlights, my eyes instantly start feeling irritated, regardless of brightness. However, if I want into a place that has well diffused lighting, regardless of color, my eyes feel fine. Something to do with pin-point sources of light or something I'm not sure; still looking into it. Needless to say, car headlights are a nightmare.

Anyway, I'm looking to install an uplight type of fixture (inverted pendant) in a study room. This will position 3 bulbs to point up and reflect light off the ceiling, instead of the typical downlight setup seen in most places. I've found that diffusing light off the ceiling creates a much softer effect than just having a downlight with a diffuser cover. I'd like bulb advice for this, as I'm struggling to find the right options. Ideally I want bulbs that will mimic sunlight throughout the day and into the night. This means bulbs that have tunable color temperature and lumens. I would like something with very high CRI and other light properties to replicate natural sunlight phases. The best bulb type for uplight is probably a BR30 type to best diffuse the light but that would be bonus.

I've looked into different smart lighting systems and I just haven't found one that works well enough yet. The closest I found is the [Lumitech PI-LED lamp](https://lumitech.com/startpage/solutions/luminaires/pi-led-lamp/) with their [DARA smart app](https://lumitech.com/startpage/solutions/luminaires/dara-en/) but I have no clue how much they are or how to acquire them. I contacted them but no one ever got back to me. They're also 230V and I would need 120V for the US. The second best system I've found is the [Philips Hue white ambiance bulb](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-ambiance-1-pack-br30-e26/046677548513) but they aren't too forthcoming on the technical specs of the bulbs [as I posted about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hue/comments/f4h634/hue_seems_very_much_a_ripoff_in_terms_of_quality/), and I'd rather not setup a hub system since this is only for 1 room, privacy and security concerns, and it's kinda pricey. The last option I've found is the [IKEA Tradfri bulb](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tradfri-led-bulb-e26-806-lumen-wireless-dimmable-white-spectrum-clear-20408475/) with their [Tradfri remote control](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tradfri-remote-control-00443130/). This actually checks most of my boxes except that the lights are only tunable to 2200K, 2700K, and 4000K and they don't disclose the CRI or technical specs of the bulb. Otherwise, I love that it has a remote control setup which doesn't require a hub, and has lumen adjustments. Ideally, it would have automatic seamless color temperature shifting and be BR30 base type. But this is all I've found thus far. A similar bulb I've tried is the [Philips SceneSwitch LED bulb](https://www.usa.lighting.philips.com/consumer/p/led-bulb/046677464868) but it's only CRI 80 and I don't like the colors it puts out, but it's similarly 2200K, 2700K, and 5000K.

f8ynsw,1582580186,Replacing an aging AMX system.,"I bought a home that came with an older AMX/Vantage system. I've been having trouble with the home audio portion recently, and it's got me thinking of replacing some or all of the system. 

I'm a software engineer and comfortable programming/maintaining the system myself.

Here's an abbreviated list of what I have:

* AMX control units mounted to the walls. 
* AMX 16x16 audio matrix (I am using all 16 zones but only a couple inputs)
* Vantage lighting with an older Q-Link controller and a ""CBox"" wireless controller (I don't know what portions are wireless). This is partially integrated with AMX but most just runs from the light switches.
* Pentair pool controller that ideally I'd like to upgrade and integrate.
* Ethernet throughout the house.
* Eero mesh WiFi.
* Carrier Infinity HVAC
* Whole house video distribution. I don't need this at all.

Here's what I would like to support. I understand that no system will be perfect and I will have to give up some functionality.

* Control home from iPhone/iPad. The wall units can go or I can replace them. 
* Control from Alexa. Ideally this could work via zone/scene names. That is, I'd prefer to say ""Alexa, do something"" instead of ""Alexa, tell XXXX to do something.""
* Integrate Rachio sprinkler controllers
* Integrate Google Music (seems like most systems don't support this)
* Reuse the Vantage lighting system and integrate. This would require upgrading to Vantage InFusion I think, but even then I don't know how common Vantage support is.
* Carrier Infinity integration is a bonus, but all systems I've looked at lose functionality like fan speed and humidity.
* Reuse the existing speakers and amps - essentially just replace/reuse the AMX audio matrix switcher.
* Integrate the pool and spa. This would require upgrading to newer Pentair controller.
* Integration with August deadbolt and doorbell a plus.

Options I've started researching

* Control4. Supports Vantage, iOS, and Alexa (I'm not sure how well). I'd use a remote dealer. Not compatible with Eero.
* Allonis. No Alexa integration at all. Supports Google Music which is a plus. DIY, which is a big plus.
* HomeSeer. Doesn't support Vantage.

I’m going to be moving into a new apartment soon and I thought it’s a good time to get into home automation. I’m just getting a bit overwhelmed by the amount of products out there so I hope I can get some tips or advice.

Here is what I’d like to achieve.

1. Multiple Light triggers based on voice, motion and good old fashioned switch. The apartment will be multi-generational and I’d like to leave the option to simply turn lights on/off with a switch to my parents.

2. Light “Profiles” triggered by time and Voice.

For example I want to say “good night [device]” and have it turn off all lights and devices in the lounge/kitchen area. Then switch the light profile to only emit dim lights based on motion (example if someone wants to grab a snack in the middle of the night, then upon entering lounge and kitchen area, the light should be dim just to guide them along).  Then I want to be able to switch back to “day mode” by either saying Good Morning, or after 8am. Alternatively if it’s easier, have low emission lights only turn on in night mode, but otherwise is inactive

3. Smart ducted air conditioner, is there a way to achieve this?

4. Turn off all devices and light if it detects all registered mobile phones have left the wifi range

5. By the same token, unlock doors and then turn on certain lights if a device has entered wifi range. The lights should be dim if in “night mode”

It looks like the Lutron Caseta Wireless doesnt require a neutral wire and is well reviewed so I was thinking of going with that. But I don't think that its inter-operable with LIFX lights, unless something has changed recently? If I wanted to set up the Lutron with the LIFX bulbs, would I have to get the wall switch and the smart hub AND a Alexa/Google Home/etc to tie in the LIFX lights?",Mr_Stay_Puft_Esq,/r/homeautomation/comments/f92317/smart_switch_without_neutral_wire/,0,homeautomation,8

f9352i,1582598366,[RELEASE] RGBGenie Z-Wave Hubitat Drivers (all of them),"# LED Controllers

All RGBgenie Z-Wave Plus LED controllers work through the Zwave-LED-Controller.groovy driver
The LED controller driver allows you to change the type of device so you are not limited by the original model purchase. You can adjust between CCT, Single Color, and RGBW models, and it will change the device's functionality at a firmware level.

RGBW Models:
You can optionally enable / disable the WarmWhite component so if you are using RGB only LED strips you won't get signals sent to the WarmWhite output mistakenly.
When using just RGB LEDs color temperature is simulated using just RGB color elemets. Between 2700K to 6500K
When using RGBW LEDs, to get the best color temperature result, you can set the kelvin temperature of the white LED element, to match the specs of your LED strips, and the color temperature range will adjust to the capabilities of your LED strip. The Cold White color temperatures are created using the RGB elements.

Features:
* Color Temperature Control
* RGB Color Control
* Dimmer Controls
* Light Effects
* Ability to change the device type at the firmware level swap between CT/RGBW/Single Color 
* Color temperature control on CCT &amp; RGBW models even using RGB only LED strips


# Touch Panels

A child driver can be loaded for each zone on the multi zone models, the Scene only models are a single Zone by default.
This child driver can be used with the Hubitat built-in mirror me application to syncronize the output of the touch panel to groups of devices that do not support Z-wave associations. For example, Zigbee or Wifi devices.
Optionally the child drivers can utilize the Scene buttons as button controllers or scene capture / activate. With the button controller functionality on a 3 scene / 3 zone touch panel you would end up with 9 buttons that can be pushed or held to have actions mapped to any functionality in hubitat.

All touch panels support up to 12 associations directly per zone. These can be utilized in any combination per zone, including multiple occurrences across each zone in the multi-zone units. Child devices occupy 1 of the 12 available associations per zone when activated.. 

Features:
* Scene capture / activate
* Button controller
* Multiple Child devices on the multi-zone capable models
* Combinations of z-wave direct association and hub control
* Ability to control any number of devices through the hub's mirror app Z-wave, Zigbee, Wifi, etc
* Configurable between scene activation / scene capture and button control features
* Insane amount of possible configurations and uses

f93kx9,1582600275,Is there a need to go buy a Phillip's Hub to add his lights if I already have a Samsung Hub? (I'm just starting),"It's a basic question but why would someone even buy other hubs like the Phillips Hue Bridge when they could just get the Samsung which works with Hue and lots of other companies all in one? Is it just a nicer app? Or do the lights actually work notocably better with both Hue Hub and Smart things?

It seems like I could just buy the Samsung Smart Things and avoid the Phillips hub all together and still get to use Phillips lights? Is that correct?

Im still a newbie and this is my first post here..I really thought I did my homework before starting to buy...

I'm a new father and new home owner.. (Its literally been a dream come true for my wife and I)

I regretfully made the choice to buy wifi only devices for my home and connecting them was hard but they seemed to work well enough to buy a few more and double down on my plan for a wifi only home. I realized they were slow and buggy so I even increased my  internet to a faster package and bought a  high end router which helped but still not great and buggy. The last straw to break happened when the wifi light dimmer in the babys nursery decided to turn off in the night while changing my daughter from a poop explosion. I've come to terms with my costly $ mistake and want to add a Samsung hub to the Google Home and not be totally reliant on wifi devices.

f98kne,1582628141,Mobile is the Fly in the Ointment,"Most automation devices use Apps on the Mobile Phone amongst other things, and it's an ideal way, when you're out of the house, to receive notifications as to what is happening - someone at the door, alarm has gone off, camera has triggered etc.

However, the mobile phone manufacturers are always looking for ways to extend battery life and in doing so they are effectively nobbling their devices when it comes to home automation. **They should really provide a reliable pathway to allow urgent notifications and activations to occur**.

Yes, you can elect that an App be immune to Doze, but that's not enough.

An example: I have a front door camera to alert when someone arrives at the door and sound a door bell on my Samsung Note9 (a reasonably powerful and responsive phone). Now I can approach the front door, unlock, open the door, swap my shoes for my slippers and be half way down the hall before my phone will announce that someone is at the door. It's not the device at the door because it recorded everything perfectly, and it's not going via the cloud (by this time) to get to my phone because my phone picks up our really strong WiFi signal as I'm coming along the drive. 

And it's not just that device: my front door MAG sensor, via my smart alarm system creates an Alexa event and Alexa announces on my phone that the front door is open. That is very variable as to how long that takes - sometimes 1 second sometimes 30 secs. I need to have it also announce it on the Alexa device then I'll get some feel for how long the gap is between Alexa attempting the announcement on my phone and the phone actually bothering to speak.

There are some posts in the Tasker section of Reddit on how to get your phone to be more responsive, but my experience is that those things don't make much difference and effectively completely disable all of the phone's power saving functionality. That is not desirable and should not be necessary.

Since my phone is a Samsung phone, I'm also going to try some experiments using Smart Things virtual switches to see whether Samsung gives priority to Smart Things (since Samsung owns Smart Things). Will report back, because if they are able to provide a reliable pathway for Smart Things then they ought to be able to create a Class to which other Smart Apps could also be assigned.

I am **not** looking for pretty packaged solutions with UIs and screens and built-in wifi. I am not looking for a Nest, for example, I'd rather instead generic decoupled temperature sensors that provide readings that can then be used to intelligently interact with the heating and cooling systems, as well as any other systems.

I see five main components:

\- raw sensors that measure the environment

\- controllers that sensors plug in to that translate voltages from the sensors into meaningful data

\- a structured database that receives and stores data from sensor controllers

\- a logic engine that acts on changes in the database (ex. IFTTT)

\- a reporting, charting, monitoring, ui/dashboard to present interesting stats and the state of the system from the database

Are there any known companies or brands that provide raw rugged commercial-grade high-quality sensors, I'm imagining something like this outdoor temperature sensor I randomly bumped into a few minutes ago: [https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-C7089U1006-Outdoor-Temperature-Sensor/dp/B000979ERY/ref=sr\_1\_7?keywords=Outdoor+Temperature+Sensor&amp;qid=1582623407&amp;sr=8-7#customerReviews](https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-C7089U1006-Outdoor-Temperature-Sensor/dp/B000979ERY/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=Outdoor+Temperature+Sensor&amp;qid=1582623407&amp;sr=8-7#customerReviews).

You will notice the sensor ends in wires and has to be plugged into something to get the data. Is there a known controller hub that can have many sensors plugged into it and it spits out the readings to a computer? How in general is the simplest and most rudimentary that we can get sensor data into a computer through a wire?

The hub could likely be Home Assistant but what about the rest?

f9eucd,1582655926,Issue with triggering routines from camera/alarm system motion and contact sensors.,"I have Ring Alarm with door contacts and motion sensors inside as well as Ring Spotlight cams outside. I use Alexa to create a routine for contacts/sensors/cameras that when they a tripped it turns on exterior lights / turns on interior lights / announces someone at the door / etc.

I have no issues finding the different devices and creating these routines in Alexa and when I manually trigger them in the Alexa app, they work properly. 

However, when I try to trigger them automatically via motion I am never able to get them to work. I can see the motions sensor sensing motion, I can hear the door contact beep when opened and I can see the notification that my camera is sensing motion, but none of the Routines that are linked to thse items trigger.

Anyone know what I am missing? These are all Amazon devices so I'm a bit at a loss why it isn't working as a whole even though each thing works fine separately. 

I do recall when I got a FireTV Stick that I could not view my Ring on it (would just ""waiting for Ring.com"" indefinitely) until I linked my Amazon and my Ring account. I am wondering if there is some similar linking that I am missing for this to work.

I see a thousand different light strips...so how compatible are they? Will they all have the same wiring?
If I buy a RGB+CCT light strip and controller, is it as simple as matching cable letter to port (e.g. R, G, W) or do a need to watch out for cheaper goods?

     I wanna build a smart home for my apartment, I wanna base it mainly off Mac ecosystem because almost everyone around me has Apple technology, my room mate, most of my friends, all my family and I so it makes sense to stick with HomeKit based smart home.  

     My idea, is to have full control over lights, sound, locks,and temperature.  Not too concerned on surveillance (don’t have a reason) or outdoor lighting since it is an apt complex.  I wanna use my old iPhone 7 (we will call it PC [public control]) as a living room remote control for almost all devices except bedrooms.  On this PC remote, room mate and I would only have control over thermostat, lights except my bed room, and sound.  My iPhone and Apple watch would be more of a master key since it is technically my apartment and I’m flying solo on this project.

     I want to use my iPad 10 pro as a hub/control panel that I wanna mount on my wall, my iPhone 7 as a remote control, my personal iPhone and iWatch as a master key.  Also I’ve read about using a SmartThings hub to eliminate strain on my WiFi but I also read that some devices such as smart bulbs require their own hub, and other smart locks and smart speakers do as well and I want to eliminate or minimize the need for many hubs. I wouldn’t mind using a SmartThings hub in conjunction with the iPad hub.  Also minimize the need for apps and simplify automation.

     Automation isn’t top priority for the moment since I’ve read that it can get complicated and has a learning curve so that’s not priority, also can I create a separate Apple ID for the home so people don’t have access to my personal info through the “pc remote” or mounted “control panel” since those are not going to be screen locked, and still use my room mates and my phone with our own private Apple IDs to control the smart home? how do permissions to other phones for example my parents work (mainly for smart lock).  

     And lastly I heard you can have control on non smart TVs using an appropriate HDMI cast device that grants you full access like a remote but on your phone or voice commands?

     Also SmartThings/HomeKit compatible devices for hubs, bulbs, thermostat, and locks that are not going to break the bank.

     Is there a rechargeable light strip that can be controlled with smart apps?

     And last question for now... which is better or hub device  iPad control panel or Apple TV 4th gen. 


I don’t have a large home but do intend on maximizing bulbs , light strips, and speakers, thermostat and locks will be added as I am able to purchase these items.

I can live with that if I must, but I’d love to have some options. Z-wave preferable, wifi is okay, reverse phasing dimming, with a proper toggle/paddle for manual operation. 

The other option is replacing all my LEDs, but that seems like more cost and effort and reverse phase dimming is superior dimming technology anyways.

My only concern is that since the exact position impacts whether half the shade is sheer, or it's all covered, I want to make sure of two things:

1) When I tell Google/SmartThings to close the living room shades, I want it to close all the way, stopping in a position that none of the sheer is visible, it will be totally closed off.

2) If I want to adjust how much sheer is exposed, I need to make really small adjustments to how open/closed the shade is - this should be in some way simple to do (ideally via voice, in calling some stored position, but I'd be okay if I could easily ""tap"" in SmartThings or any other app).

I suspect that while this need is a bit more important when looking at layered shades, the control of the mechanism is the same whether layered, solar, blackout, etc.

fa785i,1582781066,Question re Nest vs Ring,"Hi everyone,

Not sure if this should rather be in /r/homedefense but this seems like it might be a good place? Please let me know if not...

I have an (old, dodgy) spotlight wired to the front of my house. Similar one wired to the back. I have been thinking it would be good to get some cameras in - I was thinking through a few options, and was hoping for some advice:

1) Ring cam ""floodlight"" at the front, Ring cam ""spotlight"" at the back. Reuse existing wires (assuming this is a standard kind of voltage). This gets me new floodlights and never have to worry about changing batteries in the cameras.

Only downside is I'm a google fanboy, but Nest doesn't offer a floodlight version of their cam.

2) Get generic floodlights to replace the old ones, reusing the same wiring. Get two nest ourdoor cams and mount them myself, running to nearby power conduits.

Is there an obvious thing I've missed here? ie, does the ring floodlight work better with recording video since it can control the lighting itself? It probably really doesn't matter about me being more pro google as either way, I'd have to buy a subscription to either of their services... being able to turn it on or off via google home would be a nice gimmick, but I'd rather have the best solution than a gimmick.

fadnzm,1582817104,Beginner home automation (my setup &amp; challenges),"Recently, I’ve decided to finally embrace some basic home automation after considering it for the past few years. Curious to your thoughts, also still missing a few things in my setup, hoping anyone has experience on those topics.

Altogether it was quite easy to do and I was able to set it all up in about 8 hours total divided over 3 evenings (including unpackaging and googling to troubleshoot etc). And I’m not that much of a technical fella.

In hindsight, I’m honestly asking myself why I didn’t do this before. Especially the stuff around the TV really makes a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Objectives upfront:

Living room:  Automate everything that has to do with the media setup and lights

Bedroom:  Automate my alarm clock and light

&amp;#x200B;

So, with pretty much all devices I needed to install and configure the device via its own app first before I could then connect that app to the Google Home app and enable voice commands. Also, you will want to set your **phone’s** ***region*** **and** ***language*** **to the US**. Otherwise, you will not have all the features Google Assistant has to offer, like setting up custom routines. Very easy fix but was hard to find online for some reason.

The installation of the **Google Nest Mini’s** was incredibly easy and I had no issue with that whatsoever.

For the **Philips Hue,** I paid in frustration for my stubbornness. The Hue Bridge needs to be connected to your router in a direct connection, so via the Cisco switch didn't work. It will connect your lamps, but to integrate it with your Google Home it needs an internet connection (third light on the bridge). But even when I connected it directly it needed a few restarts (router and bridge simultaneously) and reshuffling the ethernet port to make it work. But once all the lights were steady and on, it integrated very smoothly.

The **Logitech Harmony Hub** I expected to be a tough one, but actually was very easy as well. You have to select all your devices you’d like to automate and it had them all in its database. This was surprising to me because my TV is quite old already and the Ziggo box is very specific to the Netherlands. Anyhow once you select them you can set up “Activities” which are basically actions you want the devices to take, put in a specific order. For example, when I say “Hey Google, turn on the Chromecast” it turns on the TV, receiver, and amplifier. Then sets the TV to the right channel, sets the receiver to the right channel and sets the audio mode on the receiver to stereo. Also, it dims my living room lights into the right TV setting. For the audio mode it needed to be done by inserting the action step by step how you would have done it on a remote (7-second delay and click “option”, click 3 times “down”, click 2 times “enter”), but the rest I could just choose from in a functionality overview. Then if I say “Hey Google, turn off the Chromecast” it powers down everything and turns up the brightness of the lamps again.

For the bedroom, I connected my Edifier stereo to the **Teufel Connector** without much issue. So far it seems to be a pretty nice device that integrates with Google Home the way a Chromecast Audio would have. Although it would be nice if the Nest Mini could answer through the Edifier by default, haven’t been able to find that option yet.

The **Hue light** was child’s play seeing it automatically connected to the Hue bridge. Once it was connected in the Google Home app, and assigned to the correct room, I could say “Hey Google, enable gentle wake-up” and set an alarm for the next morning. What happened is that 20 minutes before the alarm my Hue light would slowly start to raise its brightness before the alarm went off through the Nest Mini on the time I set it. This meant I could remove the Philips Wake Up Light from my nightstand seeing it was quite big anyway.

Regarding the **Nedis Smart Plug**, well what to say. I’ve looked at it angrily, shouted at it, but without results. It works fine with the Nedis Smart Life app (not to be confused with the SmartLife app), but although they say it works with Google it doesn’t seem to. It was impossible to find info online to troubleshoot, seeing it has the same name as the more widely adopted Smartlife app. Their support desk was unresponsive as well so I'm going to return these. Hadn’t seen before that Hue sells plugs as well so will order those. Though they don’t show energy usage, which isn’t crucial but would have been interesting to see nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

What I’m missing in my current setup;

* The ability to redirect all the sound from the Nest Mini in my bedroom to go through the Edifier in my bedroom. I’m yet to find a solution to this. So all responses, but also a simple request like ""play Spotify"" without having to spell out that it needs to go through the Edifier.
* On the topic of Spotify, when asked to play a specific playlist \[name\] it does not first check my saved/created playlists but seems to search randomly through the entire database. Does anyone know how to fix that?
* The ability to add my **mobile devices** into the Google Home app and be able to call them out like a smart device. I have two phones (work &amp; personal) and an iPad, it would be great to be able to send commands from either of those devices or the Nest Mini’s to another. So to be able to say “Google that, and show it on iPhone” or “Continue Netflix on iPad” and so on.
* A Google Nest Mini in the kitchen, missing something to shout at to set a timer when I’m cooking or play the news while I’m preparing breakfast. Or maybe a Google Nest Hub to have a screen for looking up recipes. But I’m seeing reviews that the screen and applications are quite slow to respond so might wait for a new version to be released. Does anyone have experience with that one?
* Google Hue lamps in the hallway with motion sensors. Reviews on the Hue motion sensors are a bit mixed online so not sure if I’m going through with that.
* A Google Home enabled fan. Best-case scenario I would be able to buy a wall-mounted fan that I could connect to Google Home for the bedroom. Or at least a pedestal fan. I haven’t been able to find a proper one though.
* Connect the Media PC to the Harmony Hub. It's on the to-do.
* Next-level home automation with curtains and so on. Seeing I’m currently renting I don’t see the point in investing in fixed-sized equipment that could become useless when I move. But this will definitely be continued when I purchase a home. If you have any must-haves in terms of automation, please do let me know!
* The ability to connect my G-Suite from work to the Google Home app. This feature is currently in beta and our company admin politely replied to me that we would not participate in that.

Please help save an an innocent life.,"My Xiaomi Mi robot vacuum, who we affectionately call deebot after our first robot vacuum (may he rest in peace), has been malfunctioning for some time now. Every couple of minutes it says the main brush is blocked. If you hit the clean button he will continue, but sometimes I forget or get distracted and it has lead to him very rarely being able to complete his mission. Every once in a while he'll do the whole house without issue! And for like 2 months he went into remission and the problem went away entirely, but he's now relapsed and it's worse than ever before. I'm getting worried there may be no hope. I have searched high and low on the internet and I've come across many fine folks with similar concerns, but I've not come across any cures thus far. I have tried replacing all of the replaceable parts, cleaning the sensors, and checking for software updates to no avail.

I have a 5 month old who is going to be crawling soon and a large shedding dog, so we can't afford to be down a soldier at this time. It's an all hands on deck situation, and if this continues I feel we may have to put him down rather than watching him struggle to do his job every day. Is there any hope for our brave soldier? He's only 3 years old, and when he's up to the task he does a GREAT job, so I hate cut him short if he may still have some life left in him.

fafapg,1582823577,Best dimmer switch that operates closest to a classic dimmer?,"Hi All,

I am doing a basement remodel right now and have an electrician in adding new lights and switches to have better and updated control in several places. This got me to thinking about doing home automation in the basement while everything is out and exposed. Right now in my home for lighting i have a mix of Philips Hue bulbs and a few Lutron Caseta dimmer switches. I currently use Wink for my main hub in the home.

The majority of the rest of my lights throughout the house are on regular dimmer switches. Either switches with a big slider and a small horizontal on/off switch or normal paddle switches with a thin vertical slider next to them.

Right now my main concern and area where I would love your feed back is related to the manual dimming. with the Lutron Caseta is the manual dimming is super annoying. If I control it via my phone or Alexa integration -- it's beautiful. I can say Alexa.. Living Room light 40%. Works like a charm. However, manually adjusting the dimming by hand is annoying and super slow. The other thing is -- if I turn the Lutron dimmer lights on or off with the app or by voice.. it will recall its last setting when turned on again. However, if you turn it off by hand.. there is no way.. as far as I can tell to just touch the switch and have it go back to your 50 or 70% that you turned it off at. It's either all the way on or you can start at 10% on if you bump it once.

So.. a classic dimmer works kind of the like my automated on/off scenario. The dimmer is physically set and you always go back to your last setting. Is there a better dimmer switch that has these features:

1. Can quickly and easily change dimming settings by hand.. vs the slow process I have with my Lutron Caseta.
2. Can recall the last lighting setting when turning back on through manual (by hand) operation

If I do everything by voice/phone.. none of this matters but if the hub is down or someone else is doing it .. or I just want to do something quickly.. by hand is needed and I want it to make sense and be convenient. Does my use case make sense to people? Has anyone else encountered/solved this issue with a particular dimmer switch that they like and use by both hand and phone (or voice assistant)?

fatj0t,1582890466,"Getting started, any advice on which products for the ideas listed below? Would also like to explore integrations with my Sonnen battery setup!","Like many trying to start this journey, I'm overwhelmed at the amount of options available. I'd like to add some automation and smart features to my home but not sure what devices would be the best. After some reading I understand that Z-Wave/Zigbee would be the best way to go to avoid clogging up the network with WiFi devices.

&amp;#x200B;

*Some useful background info:*

* *I live in EU, owner of my house but would rather have a less invasive setup as possible (as in not destroying stuff to pass through cables).*
* *My internet speed is crap (\~30mbps down / \~7mbps up).*
* ***I have a 10 panel solar PV system (2.95kWp), Sonnen Battery (5kWh) + Sonnen Blackout box w/ mirror fuse board. The Sonnen battery allows for interaction with Z-Wave devices, would like to leverage this.***
* *Absolutely no need for voice control.*

&amp;#x200B;

In an ideal world:

* Everything (or almost) would work without paid services / internet connection.
* Everything (or almost) would be compatible with Smartthings/Actiontiles so I could control from a central location (e.g. tablet) - so to avoid having a bunch of separate apps to control the stuff.
* Leverage the Sonnen/Z-Wave combo with electricity monitoring - I can do this on an aggregated amount through my Sonnen but would like to have a more detailed view by room / devices.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm looking for:

* Porch &amp; back yard lights on/off by daylight sensor + timer (e.g. turn on when dark, but also turn off at 11PM)
* Remote On/Off interior lights by smart switches, not smart bulbs
* Motorised black out roller blinds (currently looking at bespoke ones)
* Video doorbell
* Wireless/Wired IP Cameras (preferrably wired but I want to be as less invasive as possible)
* Alarm System (motion sensors / window sensors) - I have cats and dogs though!
* Locks (are there any that still have keys?)
* Thermostat + radiator valves
* Water leakage sensor
* Smoke / Carbon monoxide sensors
* Smart Power Strip - I have a bunch of gaming consoles I don't use on a very frequent basis but like to have the setup always ready, I'd rather have them off completely than on standby/passive (let me know if this does not make sense)

For the camera setup I'm looking at a Reolink PoE + Wireless w/ Solar option (as I'd like to have a camera on my shed out the back yard).

I've also looked at the Samsung smartthings mesh router which seems like the best option for WiFi mesh with support for Z-Wave &amp; Zigbee.

&amp;#x200B;

Would really appreciate any feedback! And apologies if this is pushing it too far, I'm just completely lost with all of the available options and joining the dots.",tchoin,/r/smarthome/comments/fatj0t/getting_started_any_advice_on_which_products_for/,11,smarthome,3

The only marketable solution that makes sense to me is that Philips Hue Sync becomes a software solution rather than a hardware solution. This is much in the same way as Steam Linked stopped being a device and became an app.

fbgfll,1582999677,Recommendations for smart home platform - upgrading an old rural house,"Hello,

I am a programmer/electronics enthusiast that has moved into a large rural house in the UK. I'm looking for a recommended platform that I can start to slowly add sensors and controls to, to be able to monitor and control high energy costs (£6k/year and rising for electricity, heating oil and gas).

I have installed a Ubiquiti WiFi network that I can extend for further reach, and I have previously used the Nest and Smartthings APIs for various projects in other places.

Outputs:

1. A Kidd Model 2 boiler (from 1997) for (single pipe) central heating and for hot water with a [Horstmann 425 Coronet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Horstmann-425-Coronet-time-clock/dp/B009JH4U9C) controller
2. An oil-fired Aga that also heats the hot water
3. Two hot water tanks, both with electric immersion ""boosters""
4. A few LPG stoves scattered around
5. An LPG combi boiler for the top floor hot water and heating
6. Several mixed fuel stoves that I'm not looking to automate :)
7. Several cheap electric convection heaters
8. An [Adax NEO panel radiator](https://adax-solaire.co.uk/product/adax-neo-black-electric-panel-convection-heater-timer-thermostat-option-2-2/) with built in digital thermostat (DegC) which is really good

Inputs:

1. No thermostatic control on any of the oil systems - they are either on or off on a schedule
2. Manual switch for the electric immersion ""boosters""
3. A classic programmable thermostat for the combi boiler
4. Several of these useless [Engbird/Inkbird bluetooth temp/humidity sensors](https://www.ink-bird.com/products-smart-sensor-ibsth1.html)
5. Some good, cheap, but unconnected [Habor Temp/Humidity sensors](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Habor-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Temperature-Replacement/dp/B07GWL6ZFV/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2MNAECZO22S48&amp;keywords=temp+humidity+monitor&amp;qid=1582993463&amp;sprefix=temp+humidit%2Caps%2C152&amp;sr=8-7)
6. A SMETS1 smart meter where I can get monthly usage, but no companion ""smart device"" where I can get realtime electricity usage or more granular data (the new provider doesn't support the old providers device 🙄

What I want to do:

1. Stage 1: Measure the temperature on a room-by-room basis and record the data
2. Stage 2: Control various systems above remotely
3. Stage 3: Implement some controls to reduce usage

I have played around with a few systems in the past:

1. Nest (pointless? thermostat location is far away from temperature usage and I would need to control several boilers/switches)
2. Smartthings (fine but not sure about any thermostat control devices?)
3. Netatmo - good user interface but physical devices felt flimsy
4. I love [Nathan Chantrell's blog](https://nathan.chantrell.net/home-automation/) but it looks quite dated now? In particular I could imagine his [TinyTX](https://nathan.chantrell.net/tinytx-wireless-sensor/) devices useful for monitoring temperature where I don't plan on extended WiFi coverage

My broad requirements are:

1. The ability to create ""zones""
2. The ability to monitor remotely (aka Cloud storage)
3. The ability to work with a range of input/devices (aka no vendor lockin)
4. I don't mind soldering/programming etc.etc. :)

I'm thinking of getting the base platform set up first, then slowly adding sensors/controls over time.

What would you recommend?

Cheers,

Jim

fbhq1o,1583004779,I need to find a light switch that works with my smart bulb.,"So I recently got a TP-Link Kasa smart bulb. I wanted to get smart lighting in my room, but didn't get a light switch because I wanted to be able to change the colour of the light. My mum, however isn't a big fan of telling Alexa to turn on the light in my room and instead presses the light switch to turn on the light, thus disconnecting the smart bulb. Also, when I want to get something from my room very quickly, having to say ""Alexa"", wait until she responds, tell her to turn on the lights and her doing so take a lot more time, and by the time the lights are on, I have already gotten the thing I needed. Then I have to tell her to turn the lights off, which takes more time and is very inconvenient. What I'm looking for is a light switch which keeps the wired connection on at all times and  when I press it, it directly connects to the smart bulb or Alexa or Google home and switches it on and wirelessly. It also shouldn't require a neutral wire and work in Europe. Can anyone give me any suggestions?

So I have a house currently being built. Only the foundations are in. We are 6-8 weeks away from the electrician wiring everything.

Today I visited a Control4 dealer in Preston UK as they were the closest to me and are a ‘platinum dealer’ according to Control4’s website.

Which made me wonder; what should I be looking out for, what should I be asking about, what can different dealers offer, do they make money from the equipment or installation mostly?

I’m pretty educated in smart home setups and equipment, I think they were surprised. He also said he wished more customers came as prepared as I did, so he knows he can’t pull the wool over my eyes 😂
