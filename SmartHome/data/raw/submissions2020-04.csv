fsoqcz,1585700216,Trigger Hue Lights Based on Activity of Z-Wave Sensor,"Good evening everyone,

I have a question regarding triggering Hue lights based on activity from a z-wave sensor.

I have Brink home security with [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) interactive services. I also have Google Nest locks and smoke detectors. While [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) cannot interact directly with Hue, is there a way to have my lights do certain things based on an [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) activity.

Specifically for this instance, I'm trying to have my basement lights turn on when the [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) sensor on my basement door is trigged. 

I would appreciate any thoughts and advise!

fsq9ok,1585705928,Leak Detected =&gt; Call My Phone,"I'm looking for a setup that will call my phone when a leak is detected.  One option is to use a SmartThings sensor and hub with an IFTTT integration.  I don't have any experience with SmartThings or IFTTT but read pretty mixed reviews in terms of reliability.  I also feel like there are too many moving parts with the sensor to the hub to the IFTTT, etc.

I’m looking for a simple and, most importantly, reliable solution.  I’d rather not, but am comfortable developing a software solution if there’s a good option.  For example, maybe there’s a way to have the sensor make a web request to an API I’m running that then calls my phone.  I know this is possible with a Raspberry Pi, but that seems like a pain in the ass.

fstgjb,1585718861,Recommendation for a camera and floodlight in one unit?,"I am looking for a camera/light combo unit to replace my 110v porch light.  
My requirements are that...  
1. It must be compatible with Blue Iris and/or MotionEye.  
2. It must be fully functional when restricted to a local network (meaning no internet access).  
3. I need to be able to operate the light using some sort of home automation system (preferably Home Assistant, although I am open to others as long as they are not cloud based).  
4.  The light must be fairly bright - at least 1000 lumens.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I thought I had found a viable (though somewhat ugly) device in the [LaView One Nova](https://smile.amazon.com/LaView-Floodlight-Motion-Activated-Security-Two-Way/dp/B07L1DD15H), but it turned out that the light can only be controlled using their proprietary app &amp; required a cloud connection.  
I would much prefer something with the looks of the [Ring Spotlight](https://smile.amazon.com/Ring-Spotlight-Battery-Security-Two-Way/dp/B0758L64L9) or the [Netvue Floodlight Cam](https://smile.amazon.com/NETVUE-LED-Floodlight-Camera-Waterproof/dp/B00009GFWM) - unfortunately, neither of those meet the the first three requirements above.

fsuufk,1585725295,How critical is it to pick one smart hub / system?,"Just bought my first home and I’m excited to be able to try to set up a smart home (on a limited scale), looking for some advice. 

The thing is, nothing seems to work together. The house already has a Nest thermostat and a nest doorbell. But I don’t want to get the nest protect (those are too expensive considering you need to get a bunch of them and they expire after 7 years). I’m also looking at a smart garage door opener (Tailwind iq3) and a smart alarm system (ring). 

Again the problem I’m encountering while doing research is, if you prioritize interoperable, and insist on always getting something that for instance can work with HomeKit then you often can’t get the “best” device based on features and functionality for its specific purpose. 

With all that said, when getting started on this kind of thing how important is it to start by picking the system? Or should you just get the smart devices that work best for you?",IReallyLoveAvocados,/r/smarthome/comments/fsuufk/how_critical_is_it_to_pick_one_smart_hub_system/,17,smarthome,39

ft0sfr,1585751305,Help with Meross Garage Opener and Home Assistant,"Turning to this community for help because I am a little lost, and y'all might be able to at least help me punch down to the problem.  A few months ago I installed a Meross Garage Door opener.  It was working great standalone for a few weeks so I decided to integrate it into my Home Assistant.  There wasn't a native integration but I found one on HACS that seemed regularly updated and it worked fine in my initial tests.  I set up a Hue smart plug to turn on some lights in the garage and I use that as the trigger for the automation to open the garage door from the house via a Hue Smart Button (it's a workaround but again, it worked fine each time I tested it).   So, if you press the button in the house by the back door, the automation opens the garage or closes it, like a simple toggle.

That all worked great for about two weeks, then all hell broke loose.   Saturday morning I woke up to the garage door open.  I was sure it had been closed when I went to bed, and when I went to HA logbooks I saw that the door was opening and closing all night, or, at least recording opening and closings all night.  Some of these entries from 'open' to 'closed' were just seconds apart according to HA, so doubt that the door was even engaging, but still, I woke up to an open garage.  I thought it might be the placement of the magnetic sensors of the Meross device, but checked those and they couldn't be closer together when the door is actually closed and they separate cleanly when the door opens.   When I remove the integration from HA, I don't get a log of what happens, but the door never opens unbidden, so I don't think that HA is causing the behavior.  The other strange thing is that when it IS integrated with HA and I get a log of the events, they only happen in the very late evening and early morning, basically between sunset and sunrise.  Which is odd.

ft2sw1,1585757834,Connecting Record Player to Sonos with Raspberry Pi,"Hi all, longtime lurker but wanted to share a project I just finished. While bored during quarantine, I decided to find some fun Raspberry Pi projects. Specifically, I wanted to see if there was a way to wirelessly connect my record player to the Sonos speakers in my house. Turns out, with a little bit of work, you can use a Raspberry Pi to make it happen (and save $450 by not buying a [Sonos Port](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/port.html)).

Here are the two tutorials I used: [one](https://www.instructables.com/id/Add-Aux-to-Sonos-Using-Raspberry-Pi/), [two](https://github.com/basdp/USB-Turntables-to-Sonos-with-RPi).

A few notes if you decide to do this project:

* I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BHGWBFY/) USB adapter to connect the output from my record player to the USB port of my Raspberry Pi Zero WH.
* I liked the Instructables tutorial, but I chose to install Raspbian Lite (without the GUI) and use SSH/Terminal to do all of the configuration. That is why I used a combination of two tutorials.
* I would use the Instructables Darkice configuration file since the 'basdp' write up didn't seem to work for me.

ft6is4,1585768365,Docker app for Sonos/Chromecast connection,"Hello,

I was wondering if anyone here knows of an docker image that would allow me to play youtube music from my phone (android) or my computer (windows) to my Sonos Play 1 speakers?

I thought of two possible options:

ft6y80,1585769756,Shelly vs Sonoff,"Hi,

I'm pretty new to the home automation world and would like some tried and tested pros and cons about Sonoff vs. Shelly. I was really inclined to get Sonoff but then I saw the Shelly dimmer and now I'm rethinking. I'm from Malta and we follow the UK electricity standard. Here are some of the things I want to achieve:

-Smart dimmable switches which support more than 1 gang.
I'm considering a Shelly dimmer since it's very small. Has anyone managed to properly fit more than 1 Shelly dimmer in a standard 3x3 box behind the physical switch to serve multiple gangs? Furthermore, what physical switch is recommended for use with the Shelly dimmer?

-Smart switches which are able to interface with smart devices (like sensors, kitchen appliances, washing machine etc...) from other manufacturers.
For Sonoff in eWeLink, I see that this should be relatively straightforward by using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/ewelink) While there seems to be IFTTT support for Shelly, it seems like it requires much more setup and configuration. Has anyone had any problems (or general advice) in this regard? If you have any other suggestions please let me know 

-In case the WiFi is interrupted, it's still possible to switch lights on/off

Must be compatible with Google Home or Alexa

Well now the price has dropped to under $5 per bulb. At that price it is worth my time to try to either hack, modify, or work around the bulbs to make them work without having to use Sylvania's TERRIBAD app.

I purchased an IP Camera, my goal is to integrate it with my home automation system (home-assistant) and get rid of the cloud integration of the manufacturer. To do so, I need to get control over the camera (i.e. become root) or access the video stream.

This is the camera I purchased: [https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/kogan-smarterhome-1080p-full-hd-wi-fi-smart-camera/](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/kogan-smarterhome-1080p-full-hd-wi-fi-smart-camera/)

**Hardware:**

\- The manufacturer is Tuya, the model is SC002-WA2 (I opened the camera and found this reference)

\- Chipset is RTS3903N

\- Only port 6668 is open (like lots of Tuya devices)

**Here is what I tried:**

\- I could not find an HTTP server running

\- I was not able to find RTSP stream and open it (... there must be one)

\- When capturing with Wireshark on promiscouous mode on the same VLAN I can only see broadcast traffic from the camera, maybe I'm doing something wrong

\- The mobile app associated with the camera (TuyaSmart) pins the public key of the cloud server, so I cannot inspect traffic

\- Tuyapi ([https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi)) doesn't support cameras

**Ideas:**

\- The camera has a micro SD interface. I can try to load something to dump the filesystem but I'm not sure how to proceed

fts3fo,1585853554,OpenALPR License plate recognition on RPI4,"Hey guys, I've been digging on getting license plate recognition working on my PI4 to have it open my gate automatically.

&amp;nbsp;

I've came across OpenALPR, an opensource tool precisely for this purpose. However, I couldn't find any repo with it compiled for armv7 and so I had to compile it manual. The process is a pain mostly due to all the dependencies necessary. To tackle this, I've decided to create a docker image which does all the work for me and I'm finally done with it and decided to share this with the community in case anyone find this helpful.

&amp;nbsp;

Since this tool is basically a command line utility, I use a Python wrapper to expose it like a service outside of the docker container. I've included a sample Python code in the image but you can override it with your own code. If you need specific Python dependencies (I've just included Flask in it), you need to take the Dockerfile and make your own image with it.

&amp;nbsp;

For the curious, the whole process from the image capturing until the gate opening is like this:

* RTSP stream from a PoE camera pointing at the gate entrance

* Feed RTSP Stream to motion so that when motion is detected it calls python code

* Python code which takes a picture of the stream and calls the OpenALPR container through a REST service

* Python code takes the rest call on the container which uses OpenALPR to get the license plate from the picture and checks if it is an authorized plate

* If so open the gate via a simple relay

&amp;nbsp;

Let me know in the comments if you need help with something.

   * Ideally with no monthly sub and local storage (eufy seems like the way to go?)
* Security system
   * Arm at night / when away to alert for entry or broken windows, ideally via google home
   * Got 3 doors downstairs and 7 ish windows downstairs
   * Seems like SimpliSafe might be good here?
* Smart switch's to ask google to turn off / control from phone / google home
   * GE seems to be a recommended one here but also seen Shelly being recommended a lot, is there much difference between them? Cost is a little expensive so i probably only wire up the main ones
   * I think wifi range should be good, but we will have a lot of stuff on wifi and responsiveness would be great.
* Would love to tell google to lockdown at night and have it set alarms + turn off all lights, and alert me if a door/window is open
* Might consider adding some motion based automation down the line but needs to be cat friendly, ideally something i can expand without having a ton of segmented systems

fu6l56,1585912527,Update switch state via sensor status,"Hello all,

I do have a question that many of you may have ... but I haven't found any post related here !

The idea is really simple : I do have a GarageDoor controlled via a Broadlink RF command. This is shown as a garagedoor switch in the Home App and is working well. I also have a sensor on the bottom of the garagedoor, that says ""closed"" when the garedoor is closed.

The thing is that sometimes, I use the regular manual switch to open the garagedoor, and thus, the status of the GarageDoor switch is not updated accordingly in the Home app. The sensor status however is updated.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would like is a way to force update the Garage Door switch status according to the sensor status. If i create an automation, it won't juste update the status, but also send the RF command ... and i'm in a infinite loop.

*I do have a homebridge setup, which means I can use whatever plugin I want if needed.*

I had assumed there would be an IFTTT compatible app that could trigger this easily, but couldn't find one.

I'm fairly committed to the HomeKit/Hue ecosystem, so had intended to purchase a Hue plug into a 6-way extension and have all the accessories on that extension. So all I really need is to be able to automatically trigger the Hue plug on/off as I switch the computer on or off.

A slight complication is that I also have a laptop which uses the same accessories. So ideally I'd only want this to trigger when BOTH devices are in standby. But if necessary I don't mind writing a webhook to keep track of which devices are on. The missing bit at the moment seems to be triggering IFTTT (or similar) when going into or out of standby.

If there isn't anything off the shelf, I guess I can go with configuring task scheduler to call a webhook from the command line, but I'd prefer something neater.

Hi all, hoping someone can help me with a wiring problem. I bought a DC Timer, a battery pack, and a water pump and want the pump turns on and off based on the timer. The system has to be wall outlet and hose-free because this set up will be placed in a community garden plot where I don't have access to an either. The pump will get water from a large bucket.


This is what the back of the timer looks like, plus the wiring diagram it came with, and a screen shot of a diagram someone on Amazon (where I bought the pump) made. 


There is a light on the front of the timer that lights up at the correct time when I use the Amazon diagram, but it doesn't turn the pump on. If I connect the battery straight to the pump, it does turn on, so the pump isn't the problem.

Also usage of a ceiling grid system, which i can adjust however i want, and let's me access ventilation and other installations.

I have my hands on another SONOFF product early - this is not available yet on their store. I'm a little confused as this clashes with their Zigbee series announcement. It's a brand new Sonoff WiFi door/window sensor - and it's not ESP based (obviously)!

I have the teardown and my thoughts here:  [https://notenoughtech.com/home-automation/sonoff-wifi-contact-sensor/](https://notenoughtech.com/home-automation/sonoff-wifi-contact-sensor/)

I haven't really kept up with smart hubs so I'm trying to figure out why so many people seem to have both Hue Bridges and SmartThings Hubs.  I realize that only a Hue Bridge can control Hue lights but it also seems that some people are using the Bridges to control 3rd party, Hue compatible lights.

Can someone explain the advantage of this?  Does the Hue Bridge give more flexibility or options in automation?  Also, do Hue Bulbs and bulbs compatible with that system create a mesh network like other zigbee devices do?

fv7cly,1586058489,Looking for camera recommendations,"Building a new custom house, and we very soon need to finalize the list of low-voltage wiring requests.  We want to be able to setup 3 cameras: an exterior one on the detached garage, interior one covering the main living space, and a doorbell camera. The main thing we need to figure out right now is whether we pay the electrician to run CAT5e wiring for us ($75 each plus $600 for underground run to garage) for PoE, or if we should just use wifi and get additional 110v sockets added near the 2 larger camera locations - the doorbell one should be able to just run of the doorbell kit's transformer. I don't think I'm going to pay the $600 for the underground wiring... I'll either have him just run the CAT5e to back of house and do the rest myself, or just stick with plugging in the camera and using a wifi extender.

In addition to the wiring issue, I may as well get your opinons on brands/models to use. Our must-have requirements are:

* can be setup to store recordings on local server or DVR (looking at Blue Iris as an option). NO CLOUD. 
* live feed and recordings from all the cameras viewable in single app or self-hosted web server
* no batteries
* motion sensing
* infrared/night vision
* exterior &amp; doorbell camera must be able to survive Canadian winters (-40°C/F)

Nice features to have, but not mandatory:

* integration into Home Assistant (especially the doorbell)
* notifications on cell phone when motion detected, during certain hours
* interior camera: sensitivity settings to prevent motion detection of our small dog 
* interior camera: very wide angle, or ability to pan during live feed
* doorbell camera: 2-way voice
* 2 or 3 second ""lookback buffer"" so that a motion-triggered recording includes some footage from just before motion is detected

It's probably not relevant to the camera choices, but I plan to do a bunch of other automation stuff: smart locks, dimmer switches, door &amp; window sensors, smoke &amp; co2 detectors, moisture detectors, and integrate my harmony hub. I'll most likely go with a z-wave or zigbee devices, with a smartthings hub and home assistant + node red on a raspberry pi. I'm a software developer so the programming aspect is not a concern.

My house is going through a major renovation at the moment and I could do with a bit of help setting up my lights.

At the moment I have 16 Tradfri GU10 bulbs in the ceiling, 3 Hue bulbs outside and 1 Tradfri E27 outside front of the house. Plus numerous Hue bulbs in lamps.

The ceiling bulbs are set up as follows:

* 6 bulbs in front room 
* 1 bulb in front room above front door
* 5 bulbs in middle room
* 4 bulbs in kitchen

I successfully connected the bulb above the front door and the kitchen bulbs to a motion sensor, which worked brilliantly, apart from the fact that the bulbs came on at the their brightest setting. 

I then tried to set up the Home Smart app, which is where it all went horribly wrong. The app is useless. It's named the bulbs in the front room in a totally random order (bulb, bulb 3, bulb 6, bulb 2 etc). It's picked up the motion sensor but I can't seem to link it to any bulbs. The motion sensor no longer works with the bulbs and it is still updating the remote control.

Thankfully I'm not living at the house so I've got all the time in the world but as I'm sitting around waiting for the kitchen shop to reopen I thought I'd set the lights up.

Is there an easier way to do this? I'm more than happy to reset everything back to the factory defaults.

Plus let me know but give me simple instructions, I work in IT so I'm pretty tech savvy but this home automation is confusing the hell out of me!

Especially in the case of more complex networks, with a mostly wireless communication structure, as with Smart Home Systems, where e. g. Mesh Networks can play a role and with many clients of different functionality, which are interdependent in the matter of data exchange.

With this kind of networks how to:

* apply the TDD paradigm to (wireless) Networks? How to test individual components or the system as a whole?
* debug errors in such networks or prevent errors from occurring in the first place? Especially with regard to malfunctioning data transmission, where I suppose it can be quite difficult to determine the source of errors in a complex and perhaps non-linear process chain.

Which tools can be or are used to address these problems? Are there any best practices? Do you use any tools to visualize the network topology or isn't this helpful?

Since I've never worked with larger networks before, I think that a visualization could be quite useful to grasp the whole network structure and get a better understanding of it and the ongoing processes.

fvglv3,1586104404,Somfy vs Bali shades?,"Hi,

I've been researching smart motorized shades for what feels like forever....

I've narrowed my choices down to Bali Autoview (Zwave it looks like) or Somfy (unsure if these are zigbee or RTS with a hub needed?).   I'm likely going to control them using home assistant likely, perhaps homekit - I have both.     The pricing at springs blinds or blinds galore put them virtually equal in price about 250-350 per shade.   That price range matches the budget I'm willing to pay for shades.  

I ruled out the Ikea shades, not a big fan of grey, they are always out of stock, no valance.   Who knows when the Ikea stores will even open again - may, perhaps June.....

Anyone have any thoughts on the quality of Bali or Somfy and which is likely to be higher quality/reliable long term?

For control I use both Alexa and Homekit (Apple TV).  My network is getting filled up with all these different devices talking to the router and I am wondering if there is a better way.

I have been trying to figure this out on my own, but to be honest I get a bit confused with all the different options out there.  I could use a little direction on where to get started. My ""wants"" to hopefully keep the option of using both Alexa and Homekit to control as many of the devices as I can. I would also like to clean up my network by moving some of these onto a bridge or hub but do not know if that is how it works.   I read that is that some hubs, like SmartThings, can possibly coordinate and control the devices by using a different frequency to connect. I am not sure about that, but I gotta think there is a better way to build up a coordinated smart home.

If it matters, I am using Hoobs to run a MYQ garage door opener through Homekit so I can use Carplay to open the garage when I get home more easily.  It was not easy getting Hoobs set up since I am not a coder, but I eventually got it done and it has been working quite well.

This picture is one reason why. Do you have a box of these collecting dust at home? If any of them are 12v, or between 24v and 60v, you can use them to power the Shelly 1 for a variety of projects. The Shelly 1PM and Shelly 2.5 will also work with 24v to 60v, but most of my adapters are 12v. Also, the Shelly 1 has dry contacts, which makes it really flexible for different projects.

**Right now, the Shelly USA web store (**[**HERE**](https://shopusa.shelly.cloud/) **- not an affiliate link, just their web store)** has a great sale on product bundles, so it is an excellent time to get your hands on some of their relays at an extra savings.

Connect + to N and connect - to L. If you mix them up, you will smell magic smoke as it escapes. Also, if you use a higher voltage power adapter, make sure your barrel adapter is rated appropriately.

**It's THAT quick to set it up on a breadboard** to test before you climb on a ladder. One thing you need to set here is under ""Timer,"" enabling the Auto off function, with a setting of .25 seconds to mimic a momentary switch for your garage door opener.

**Now we discover if this is going to be the easy way or the fun way.** Check the wiring harness for your garage door opener. Odds are, you'll have a couple of ports for the wall mounted button and a couple for your safety sensors. If they're all in two ports, you'll do this the easy way for sure! If there are 4 ports, connect your Shelly 1 in parallel to the button, with I connected to + and O connected to -. Tap the power button in the Shelly app. If your door opens, great! Put everything in an enclosure and you're done. See the red circle to show where mine are.

**If it doesn't open, don't worry** \- you can still automate this, the same way that I did.

**When I determined I can't wire in parallel to my button**, I pulled the PCB and determined how it is powered. It connects to two low voltage wires and has 3 switches built in (door, light, PIR), so that means PWM. I connected leads from the garage door opener over head with two stainless steel screws and nuts.

**Back at the garage door opener**, I inserted two leads into the terminals for the button, which I then split with Wago connectors - it can be tough getting multiple wires to fit in the terminals and I wanted to have shorter wires on the kit.

**Here's the final shot**, with the 12v power adapter plugged in beside the garage door opener and the parts box secured to the side of it. Later on, I'll probably get a high quality enclosure and redo the wires with heat shrink tubing, just to make everything look more professional. All, told, though, with a UL listed Shelly 1 relay and a handful of junk parts, you can do this project for less than $20 bucks.

**I actually ordered a replacement button**, so that I could keep one on the wall but also have one to experiment with. If you have a higher tolerance for ""custom controls"" in your house than there is in mine, or if you've got an easy power source and the ability to wire in the wall behind your existing button, skip that step and do everything there.

**Time to install? 45 minutes - including setting up an LED tester on a breadboard.**

The smart switch I'm getting doesn't have a screw terminal to secure the line wire.  Instead it comes with it's own wires that I connect in with wire nuts.

fvwbxz,1586168580,Please help create a voice controlled TV setup + other control solutions for my paralyzed mother in law!,"Hi everyone! I am currently staying with my tetraplegic mother in law here in Sweden who just came home for the first time since her bike accident that left her paralyzed from the neck down. I'm trying to increase her quality of life by making as much as possible voice controlled. However, I am overwhelmed at the options and combinations available and the compatibility issues that could arise. I would greatly appreciate if someone could suggest a good starting point or a list of items that could give use a solution for her needs! I've googled a lot and even bought some things, with varying levels of succes. Rather than continuing being stuck I figured I could take you up for some help since between everyting I have very limited (nonexistent) spare time to continue researching! The things we'd like for her to control, at the very least are:

* Calling
* TV (cable + streaming)
* Room temperature
* Lights

First up, we currently have an Amazon Fire TV Cube paired with her ""dumb"" TV she had from before which allows her to turn on the TV, swith inputs and search Netflix (somewhat) and even allows calling through Skype to landline. Calling has worked pretty great but the TV setup is quite dissapointing. At the moment she can not switch channels, it's not digital cable with a box, just a cable that goes directly into the TV. Searching through Netflix on the Cube is also very disapointing, it often takes you back to the home screen rather than trying to find within Netflix once its open. And in general navigation is a bit crappy for instance if you want to see the episode list to know what you've already seen. Switching inputs often takes you to SCART input etc, her TV does not allow disabling of inputs (which the TV at the hospital allowed). In general the voice controlled capabilities of this unit in terms of TV control have been somewhat exaggerated in my opinion. But I suppose it could also be the fault of Netflix's implementation which I suppose would leave us stuck no matter what?

Before diving through the rabbit hole of TV setups with me further down below. Do you already have some advice of how I can improve this setup? I don't mind switching eco-systems and ditching what we currently have. It would be well worth the investment if it allows her a sliver off control over her life. It's rather heart wrenching to see it unfold so any help is greatly appreciated!

Secondly, room temperature seems like a less complicated endeavour. Unfortunately the apartment building does not have an individual termostats per flat so we're thinking of getting a heater/cooler with built in termostat that we'd pair either directly with Alexa or someting like that, or through a HUB. Seems like there is more information available out there and it's as far as I have read more plug and play. I'd take suggestions for which unit though! :)

Lastly, lights also seem quite easy to implement. Either directly in Alexa, I vaguely remember reading something about creating groups. Otherwise hubs could provide solutions?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Now onto specifics and ramblings of where I get stuck for the TV. In the US I read there is Tivo which allows you to switch between cable channels. Is there something else for non-US territories to get that working? IR blasters? Universal remotes? Anything? I have found a cable provider that has many different top boxes.  [https://www.comhem.se/tv/utrustning](https://www.comhem.se/tv/utrustning)  
It even has Tivo, but afaik in Sweden it does not allow switching of channels through voice (?).

Secondy, apparently you can just plug in the TV cable module card directly into the TV. How would this work? Would it make the setup less complex? Would this require the TV itself to have built in voice control? Or can a Google Home or Echo/Cube take control of the full extend of the TV to switch between apps and cable that way? Something which our dumb TV currently does not do?

Are Fire TV's, Android TV's worth looking into then? Is there actually a difference between a TV with built in voice control, and one that you just hook a voice control unit into?

At this point my brain is failing to make sense of the above anymore :( I basically need to guarantee that it's simple to use since she is not tech savvy, and not have any button presses involved since she has no function over her limbs. I know this is longer than usual posts but I'm at a loss so figured I'd share where I'm at and hope it will help you inform us, if you so please!

The code(perhaps extracted from email?) would then be programmed to my smart lock for usage between 8AM-8PM(or whatever time covers majority of shipments) and after usage automatically lock the door and delete the code. Code would expire/be deleted if not used for a week.

Would be some work to switch, but just not feeling it and want to look around. I'm a gadget toting techie type with a background in network and software, not afraid to dive into things, but don't want to have to write all my own plugins either. Which is why I spent a little up front on HS, plug and play mostly. What I have/want to do:

* Run on Windows 10 Pro machine (shared Minecraft/Plex/Unifi/file server)
* Homeseer-brand SmartStick+ USB Z-wave interface
* All Z-wave switches/deadbolts throughout house (GE/Inovelli/Homeseer/Schlage)
* Multiple MyQ garage door hubs
* Ecobee
* TP-Link WiFi plugs on some appliances
* Ubiquiti cameras (running thru Unifi Protect, also have BlueIris installed but would be nice to go direct)
* Unifi network
* Have a number of old devices would like to put to use as wall interfaces - Android tablets, early gen Kindle Fire, Android/Win10 phones
* Alexa Echos scattered about for voice control
* Want to automate irrigation; blank slate here other than a couple hose-spigot B-hyves, but have underground runs to change valves for solenoids and integrate it all
* (Also own a Gen2 Smartthings hub in a drawer somewhere if that's useful)
* WAF: stable, ease of use upon completion  


Why switch? Overall Homeseer's been pretty stable, easy to setup, good compatibility. But, IMO it is expensive and far from slick - The interface is not great, the HSTouch software to build your own interface software is clunky and seems like it's all but abandoned, so why invest time in it, and the client is not great.

Interestingly, there are functions and settings that are possible to use via the IR remote that you can't access via ThinQ, and vice-versa. In the process I also found a bug in the communications stack of the ThinQ module's firmware - this bug is actually quite noticeable to the end user and explains why some ThinQ operations get randomly delayed or fail.


While I (almost) completely understand the communications format now, I don't understand the meaning of many particular values. I'm an amateur at this but I found the APK for the LG installer app, which can read the entire command set.

I have an F150 and park close to the left wall of my home garage in a single overhead door bay. I've previously put indentation in the wall for my Tundra door, but this is not enough for the F150. So now I turn the truck to the right just before hitting my stop.  This leaves the truck out of a straight line and makes backing out rather uncertain.

My thought for a solution:

To install a laser line projector that put a line in the direction of the vehicle travel and hit the windshield wiper. It would be so I know how far I am from the center positioning as I back out. The question is how to do it? The project would need the laser and a way to detect where the door opener was active in order to turn on the laser. I could use a Raspberry Pi for a controller if needed. But would prefer not to.

A light sensor pointed at the opener was my first though to activate it. I could also tap into the light on the opener for power. I had thought about replacing the opener bulb with external LED light bars  anyway. So suggestions on either of these? Or an alternative?

Any ideas on how to design this are appreciated.

We got a Samsung Smart TV for her room and I want to simplify the process of using it for my parents but also take advantage of what it can do. I think we could be doing a lot of great things with it, but I am not sure how to figure it out and how to write up the instructions in a clear way for them so that they can do it themselves. Right now, I am the only one who can semi-operate it, which is a source of understandable frustration because if I am not here, how will they find the cool things that I am showing them? 

My understanding is that it is possible for my mom to link her Samsung tablet that she doesn't use very often to the Smart TV. I think that if she did so, it would make it easier to do things like browse the Internet without using the remote with the onscreen keyboard. 

Here is what I am thinking of doing. I would appreciate advice and to know if this even makes sense.
1. Create a gmail account that both my mom and I can access
2. Use this account on her Samsung tablet to create a Samsung account that can be linked to the TV.

I thought it might be nice to cast a Zoom call with my kids to the Smart TV, but it was just frustrating because the audio came through my phone.
3. Be able to type things on the tablet and have them sync with what is happening with the TV.

I am also wondering specifically if I could set it up to:
1. Have a simplified home screen that shows Prime video and not much else - I think they are fine with having Prime video, cable (which has been set up now), and the DVD player.
2. Show a photo album of the kids - would this be something where they'd need to upload photos via the Samsung account?
3. Do a Google hangout with my kids
4. Play music through a streaming service
5. Listen to podcasts - I don't think my parents even know what podcasts are, and I myself am pretty new to understanding podcasts, but there are some that I think my mom might find interesting.

The only way I can really think to make this happen is to get a switch, like a Zooz or Inovelli that lets you disable the relay. So I can have power always going to the unit. But then I would need some sort of zwave relay in the unit itself to turn power on/off to the fan and light independently.

I tried to make an AP from one router but it has to be wired with an ethernet cable. Something I don't want because then I will have the C6 and an E4 in my living room (which is aesthetically displeasing).  


\- Is there a way that I still can use everything? Or should I leave the C6 and RE200 and just stick with the Decos? I already ordered a second 2pack of Deco E4s.  
\- If I stick only with the Decos, can I set up everything and later remove the C6 router or should I always have a router with the Decos together?",cplfromholland,/r/homeautomation/comments/fx41jh/what_do_you_think_would_be_the_best_setup_looking/,1,homeautomation,0
fx4ark,1586342595,Recommendations for a smart thermostat?,"I have a new build apartment with two zones. I live in the UK, and the power is 230V to the thermostat. The thermostat I have is a [Honeywell ST9500C](https://heatingcontrols.honeywellhome.com/products/Time-Controls/Wired/ST9500C/), and there is a control dial in each zone.

I bought a Nest Thermostat 3, but decided I couldn't use it because wiring it for two zones requires a second thermostat (dial at least), and probably takes hiring someone to come and fit it.

I have a pretty extensive home automation setup, I have a custom Zigbee network (zigbee2mqtt), and an [Aqara Temperature / Humidity sensor](https://www.aqara.com/us/temperature_humidity_sensor.html) in each room. I don't really need a dial to control the thermostat in the zones, I can automate that away.

What I want is a WiFi or Zigbee thermostat that's compatible with my setup, and works in the UK. It should not use cloud services and I should be able to integrate it into [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io).

I've looked around and haven't found anything like that, it seems like the options are limited, especially in the UK, and they all rely on cloud services.

fx9pvk,1586363683,2 switch shelly hookup help,"hello all.   
I have purchased some Shelly 1 devices a while ago. I have hooked up 1 in my cupboard and it works a treat. I wanted to add one to the hallway, my problem is it's a 2 way switch and I don't know how to hook it up.   
Let me clarify on this; There are two independent switches 1 at each end of the hallway that controls 2 overhead lights both of those lights turn on and off at the same time when either switch is flipped. It does not matter which way the light switch is it will toggle the light. If pressing 1 switch down turns it on; pressing up on the same switch up will turn if off.   
If pressing 1 switch down turns it on the other switch will turn it off no matter which direction it is currently. 

Doing some digging to UK standards ( I reside in the UK) I found this 2 way switch diagram   
[https://images.app.goo.gl/iPBSgG3a2sLwVwLQ8](https://images.app.goo.gl/iPBSgG3a2sLwVwLQ8) which seems applicable  


Also found this on 2 way switch for shelly but wasn't super helpful

 [https://community.openhab.org/t/solved-shelly1-wiring-with-2-way-switching-hotel-switch/77534/2](https://community.openhab.org/t/solved-shelly1-wiring-with-2-way-switching-hotel-switch/77534/2)   


Taking pictures of my switches this seems relatively accurate with the exception that it's the old british standard of wiring colorcodes (red and black)  
Here are 2 pictures of my switches  
1st switch nearest to the door is Blue, red and yellow. (metal box grounded) 

[https://imgur.com/CeHIL81](https://imgur.com/CeHIL81)  
2nd switch furthest from the door is blue, red, yellow and a group of blacks(i guess neutral?). and Green metal box grounded. 

[https://imgur.com/nGSHUR4](https://imgur.com/nGSHUR4)  


My assumption is I would put the shelly in the 2nd box buuuut how do I hook it up to make shelly and both switches function? Would Black go in neutral, I split a live (red) off to to L . I dont know what to put in SW, I would guess Yellow as I think switch command comes from there on the opposite switch. What do I put in 0 and 1?  


The 2nd box appears to be the main hub for the other 2 rooms since it has all the blacks group together.   


Lastly obligatory yes I know I am doing this at my own risk, yes I know I could die. I do take it seriously, all circuits are off at the junction box, I have purchased specific srcrewdrivers to work on this that are rated for live wiring (which I am not) and I have esd mat and gloves.

Best case, we'd only have one switch on the wall that would control the fan and heater and nothing for the lights, since Hue can control them.

In about 30 days, I'll be moving my family into a new house we are building.  I decided early on to go with a Control 4 system and integrate it with Legrand's adorne smart and standard switch collection ([Link here](https://www.legrand.us/adorne.aspx)). I love the look and feel of them as well as the huge amount of customization in colors and styles - and yes we went with white everywhere but at least there are options!

As of right now, I'm unsure which voice control system to go with but am leaning towards supplementing Control 4 with Homekit integration since my wife and I both use Apple devices and I like the Apple control center integration.

Here are the smart switches I went with:

sofTap Wi-Fi Switch - Master and Remote ([Link to Master](https://www.legrand.us/adorne/products/wireless-whole-house-lighting-controls/astp155rmw1.aspx))

sofTap Wi-Fi Dimmer - Master and Remote ([Link to Master](https://www.legrand.us/adorne/products/wireless-whole-house-lighting-controls/adtp700rmtuw1.aspx))

If anyone has any experience with the adorne collection or Control 4 positive or negative, I'd be grateful to receive it.

If anyone is contemplating a similar purchase, I highly recommend finding a good lighting/electrical supplier.  Their prices were about 25%+ less than retail.

I'm getting increasingly frustrated with the steering devices with Tradfri, it's taking me forever to set up all the GU10 bulbs.

I understand that Smartthings are compatible with Tradfri so I was thinking of getting the Smartthings hub and setting the bulbs up through that instead. I also use Philips Hue with hub so Smartthings seems like the way forward.

I can't lock the door to the garage as it is a large sliding barn door so I am looking at locking the fence gate and a security system in the garage. 

Not wanting professionally monitored as it being open, I get cats and rats that my infrared blink camera picks up.  Thinking just a infrared sensor and a siren or notification in the house that alerts me that there is something/someone in the garage. And I can check it on a camera I already have in there. 

I use Alexa for HA currently with wifi Lifx bulbs, wifi plug switches and August Locks. Nest and Blink cameras. 

Research tells me I have to up my game to a system like Home Assistant or similar and a Z-wave hub.  I just ordered a Pi. 

Automating a gate lock turns out to be more difficult  This page was the only how to I could find. [https://livinghightech.com/smart-lock-outdoor-gate-alexa/](https://livinghightech.com/smart-lock-outdoor-gate-alexa/) After reading Amazon reviews the lock seems sketchy at best. 

Home Assistant being free and Open Source is good but I'm afraid it might be more than I need.   I need a Z-wave Hub, is there a brand that is more used/popular? What is the range like?

fxzcmn,1586461937,"Restricting access with passwords, location, or voice profiles? So many use cases","I have a question: Are there any options available for home automation that allow restricting access to specific users, specific rooms, and so on? My search results are endless complaints of users of Google Home and other systems about the lack of these features. I've looked into open source alternatives and so on, but I haven't seen any options to address these issues.

There are a ton of use cases that require these features. For example:

* People are working from home in record numbers during this pandemic. Having children, partners, roommates, etc., be able to control any device or cast to devices from any room \*to\* any room can cause all sorts of issues. Some of the complaints I've seen online involve issues caused by children who don't understand that they are causing a problem, roommates playing pranks on people, etc. Nobody wants to be in the middle of a video call for work and have someone start casting porn to a TV in the background (or playing music, messing with lights, etc.).
* Security. Some of the complaints refer to issues such as the ability of someone to stand outside your garage door and tell it to open. In one case, a user wanted the ability to have the device restricted to their voice, but this isn't a voice command-specific issue. Anyone with access to a network can unlock doors, open the garage door, etc., from smartphones as well.
* Inability to have a \*\*private\*\* network in the first place. Some people are forced to use shared wifi, whether in an apartment complex, with roommates, at work, or on a university campus. Other people on the network may be neighbors, coworkers, or strangers. And before anyone dismisses the university wifi issue as a problem affecting undergraduates only, consider the fact that many universities also provide housing to graduate students and their families. When a graduate student's partner, whose work is entirely unrelated to a university, is at the mercy of random strangers on a large network, that can be problematic.

And just for fun, here's a video on how voice commands can be encoded as light, allowing people to simply shine it through a window (etc.) to control devices as if via voice commands: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozIKwGt38LQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozIKwGt38LQ)

In sum, there are three issues I have no idea how to solve and which prevent me and tons of other people from securely using these devices, or even prevent us from using these devices altogether:

1. Restricting access to certain users, e.g. through passwords in smartphone apps
2. Restricting voice commands to certain voice profiles
3. Restricting access to certain devices to command from \*within that room\*, for example

Are there any solutions to \*any\* of these problems? The refrain in responses to the voice command issue, for example, is that these features weren't designed with security in mind. But what about password-protecting access in smartphone apps, or restricting voice commands for devices in a room to that room?

These seem like really simple features to implement, and I am honestly shocked that they either haven't been implemented or are not made clear to users. People can accidentally or maliciously make these systems entirely unusable for many users.

Thank you for any advice you can offer.

Edit: I should mention that for many users, using shared wifi to create a private network isn't an option. Often there isn't access to a router, or it's not allowed, etc.",skinsuitoff,/r/homeautomation/comments/fxzcmn/restricting_access_with_passwords_location_or/,0,homeautomation,1

fy0dys,1586465390,Beginner just getting started - have some questions,"Hi All,

I recently bough a small home and hoping to get started with a few stuff to make the place smarter. It's a 1100 sqft 2 storied home, both floors have about equal dimensions. I'm trying to do everything in a small budget. Here are my questions:

- WiFi: I have the regular Netgear WiFi router I've been using for a while. It should cover the whole house, but if not, I'm planning to use an extender. Any advantage with a mesh wifi in a smaller place like this? 
- Switch: I've looked into both Kasa and Lutron switches, but have seen everyone raving about Lutron switches everywhere. So I'm willing to consider paying more for Lutron if it has a great ROI in the long run. From what I have, I will need 3 one-way switch, 3 two-way switch and 1 three-way switch. I don't care about dimming capabilities at all. I'm a bit confused with the Lutron options out there - most of them are dimming and the non-dimming ones are apparently more expensive? Also, not sure what are the differences between Casetta, Diva etc. Also asking for recommendation on buying from Amazon vs. local Home Depot/Best Buy. Since Lutron tend to be pretty expensive, is it a good idea to start with Kasa since I have a smaller budget at the moment?

- Hub / Smart Controls: At some point, I want to play around with Home Assistant. My goal in the long run is to control light switch, thermostat, TV, garage, Ring/Simplisafe security &amp; their sensors through Amazon Echo. I want the WiFi to be connected to the least number of devices to account for bandwidth. How do you recommend I set up for a small house like this with a limited budget?

Things I've considered:

* Using the LiftMaster remote (893MAX) to trigger the light? Seems like there's a proprietary ""Security+ 2.0"" protocol that will be hard to implement.
* Hacking the LiftMaster garage light (827LM) somehow. This light turns on when the door opens, so there's clearly a signal I can listen to. Is there a cheap z-wave transmitter I can install here?
* Hacking the LiftMaster wall controller (880LMW) somehow. This has a motion sensor on it.
* Using a separate (z-wave compatible) signal as garage door input: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx3XlsKw588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx3XlsKw588). Seems like a stretch to implement, especially since there are multiple remotes.

Completely separate options of last resort:

* Installing a z-wave tilt sensor on the door.
* Installing a motion-sensor-enabled z-wave light switch.

I have two light switches that control the bottom plugs of all the outlets in the room (about 6 of them) The only way i know to fix this is to open up the wall where my tv is mounted and search for the wire that must of been cut which i prefer not to do. The outlets (top plugs) still work. I am looking at getting new outlets (since they are brown and I want to replace them with white outlets) and when i do i will bridge them to be always on outlets rather than controlled by the light switch. However i am still wanting to be able to control my bulbs with a switch rather than by voice command or an app. 

I was looking at something like the hue button to do this. (this is my ideal use case scenario) however hue bulbs and bridge are way more expensive than I want to spend right now. I am looking for something that I can use either a smart plug or wyze bulbs or cheaper smart bulb solutions. something to achieve this. I know the ideal fix is to tear out the drywall to try and fix the broken wire but at this moment that is not option for me.  

If the hue bulbs and bridge and button are the best available then i may just have no other option than to spend the $200 to get this done but really would prefer not to do that. 

What i am basically looking for is an cheaper alternative to the Hue Button that I can put in place of my two light switches to be able to controll the smart bulbs in that room. I do have a google mini speaker but really dont want to use an app of voice commands to turn on and off my lights. My wife and guests would not like that. Any help would be great.

fynb93,1586548334,Home assistant or Openhab? based on what I have already,"So I have been struggling with an openhab install and it seems at every step of the way I am blocked by my devices not having better support. So I figured Id go back to the drawing board and recheck if I am really making the right call with openhab. So here is what I wanna do, what I have and I'm asking you which is the better platform for me?

So here is what I want to do:

[https://youtu.be/G3T8z5vgX50](https://youtu.be/G3T8z5vgX50) 

Here is another example:

 [https://youtu.be/bfyc5jY1qHE](https://youtu.be/bfyc5jY1qHE) 

The guy behind these 2 videos is  Go3Team also a member of reddit and IPCAM talk. I have been unable to reach him for info on how he did this, but I know he used openhab. I have been tryting to learn openhab but holly cow my head is about to explode, so I'm considering HA.

Now the reason I am looking at going to home assistant is this. My #1 goal is to get my Dahua z12e IPcamera with mic and speaker to play sounds when the see people coming onto my property. Something like ""why hello"" at 2 feet in, ""hey now who might you be"" at 6ft in, and lastlly ""better have a package for me"" at 15ft in.  That's just an example but you get the idea. As you can see go3team has done basicly this in the video.

Openhab seems to have issues with alot of MY smarthome hardware. So here is my stuff.

9x Tuya smart 5x plugs 1x switches, 3x bulbs. 

3x Leviton switches

1x panasonic plasma TV (seems equally supported by HA and openhab)

7x ONVIF IP cameras

1x Dahua starlight z12e camera.

Openhab has python scripts for leviton, tuya. Which is not the same as having full binding support. However dahua camera does have a binding but its support is still limited and it makes using those items in openhab far more difficult as least for me.

Enter HA. So it got me thinking can i do the same thing go3team did in HA instead and I started to answer this question, but of course its not that easy. It appears support for MY stuff is better in HA and HA is a lot easier then Opehhab. So the question is which is really better for me based on what i have and ease of use?",madhits,/r/homeautomation/comments/fynb93/home_assistant_or_openhab_based_on_what_i_have/,2,homeautomation,4

As far as I can tell, we want to keep those switches ""always on"". But I can't find a simple way to be able to turn them off physically. We would either have to pull out our phones and go to the apps, or use Alexa from the other room.

Am I missing an obvious solution here? Best I could find is the Philips Hue Tap but that basically doubles our total cost because we would need 3 of them for 3 lamps. Maybe that's just the way it is.

I bought some smart led flood lights, novastella is the brand but the app used with them is the smart life app. They were recognized very easily in the app and with the smart life Alexa skill I am able to fully control them using Alexa. Here's the thing, I'm building a ESP8266 device that senses the presence of my car in the garage and I would like that sensor to trigger the flood lights and change their color. So if it's after sunset and my car isn't there the lights are on 100% and bright white, if it's after sunset and my car is there I want the lights to be blue. Between sunrise and sunset the light should be off.

I initially thought this would be not too difficult as there must be some way for the esp8266 to trigger Alexa but I quickly learnt that isn't the case.

So then I tried using ifttt, where I was pleasantly surprised to see smart life has a service. I was planning on using webhooks, and sending a POST to trigger the lights. However it seems that while I'm connected to the smart life service, none of my devices are showing up. All I get in trying to set up the trigger is ""options unavailable"" in the drop down menu where my devices should be. After some digging on forums, saw that creating a scene in the smart life app might be a workaround as in ifttt you will see scenes but not individual devices. For the life of me I can't see that option in the smart life app to create a new scene.

My last resort is to figure out the different packets that are being sent to the light to do the things I want and then mimic them in the esp8266 code. This option is going to be really difficult for me as I have very little idea on even how to start doing this.

Any and all help regarding this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

fzll24,1586648053,Temperature control in my smart reptile room,"Hey everyone, I’m new here! 

My roommate and I have spent the past year or so trying to make our reptile room as smart as possible. We keep all of our tropical species in another area because of the more stable temperatures, but the room in question houses only temperate and montane species - because of the all important temperature fluctuations between day and night and across seasons. For a bit more info, we’re keeping lots of salamanders, rattlesnakes, various pit vipers, alligator lizards, and more. We’ve got our lights on smart timers that turn on and off with the daily sunrise and sunset times (hugely important) a smart temperature and humidity logger that records and graphs the conditions of the room, and a google home mini that runs a few voice commands for the room. 

The thing we still haven’t pinned down is our temperature fluctuations. Ideally, we’d be able to do at least 10-15 degree temperature drop at night, with daytime ambient temperatures a little below 80 at the hottest part of the year and into the 50s at the coldest. Currently, door and vents are sealed off from the rest of the house so the room can be controlled on its own. We’ve got a LG window air conditioner that we will set our maximum temps too, and open/crack the windows if we need a little extra chill from outside. 

Long story short, our current system isn’t really performing to the temps we need, and we’d like the day/night and seasonal fluctuations to be as pre-programmed and automated as possible. We are also aware that what we’re asking is probably going to run our power bill pretty high. We’re still new to the whole automation thing, so we’re not sure what exactly would help us out. I’ve been looking at the google nest E as a possible solution but don’t know if it will be compatible with the window unit in the room, or if that even can do what we want. The info on the google website doesn’t go into enough detail as to be helpful here, but we’re hoping having the google home in the room will also give us some extra capability.

fzxgml,1586700979,Hue motion sensors and Alexa routines,"Hello, fellow home automation enthusiasts! I've got a question that hopefully someone out there may be able to answer when it comes to some Philips Hue tasks. 

My current project is working on a Hue lighting routine for nighttime. The lay of the land is that there's a Hue motion sensor fixed on the wall above my staircase. When I'm going downstairs at night, the sensor tells the light at the bottom of the stairs (I've named the ""landing light"") to turn on at 10% brightness. So far, so good. Easy enough. (Side note, that landing light is only used for this sole lighting routine and is not used in daily life otherwise - why that's important comes into play in a minute.) The next thing I'd like to have that same routine do is light up the kitchen at 10% brightness as well. 

NOW - there are two ways I understand I can do this. 

1) Create a zone in the Hue app and run the routine in that zone (including the landing light and the kitchen). Just control that zone, simple enough. 

2) Create a routine within Alexa that acts in tandem with the routine in the Hue app. The Alexa routine would just turn on the kitchen lights at the desired brightness, and then shut them off after a predetermined amount of time. I've got that one in the bag. 

Here's where the problem arises and what I can't figure out. Let's say  I'm already in the kitchen with the lights on at 100% because I'm doing something and someone else comes down the stairs. The routine overrides the current state of the bulbs and dims them to 10% which is not wanted at that time. The landing light is doing the same as desired. Basically I'm looking for a routine, an IFTT skill... anything that will let me say ""**IF** the *kitchen lights* are already ON, **then** do nothing. **If** they are OFF, **then** run routine x.""

Ultimately I know I can just get another Hue sensor and set it up in the kitchen to just run the desired routine, but if I can be savvy and save myself the $40 I'd rather have a little fun with it.

I would like to ask you if you can recommend me some device for monitoring temperature and humidity, it can be device working out of box, or some Raspberry Pi or Arduino project.

* Cheap as much as possible
* It should last on battery as long as possible (more than month)

My case for Sonos would be the fact that it also works with Google Assistant and since I have YouTube Red subscription, I can avoid having to pay for an Amazon unlimited music subscription.

I also need a good wireless speaker for my desktop computer and may as well have a Sonos that integrates with the rest of the house.

Can Sonos play music on individual speakers as well as a group? For example, can I ask Alexa to play music while in the kitchen and have it use just one speaker as opposed to a defined “living room” group — but if I choose, have it play in the living room group? Can the same be accomplished via Google assistant?

Also, can the Sonos be simultaneously connected to multiple bluetooth devices? So can I use it with my computer and when Im not using it with the computer, still have it work as the media player for an echo device?

I was thinking of getting a Sonos beam, 2 wireless speakers for downstairs to add to the TV surround sound (as well as use for music playback with Echo — possible?), 1 upstairs in the office and 1 in master bathroom because I like music in the shower 🙃

Can I create two groups — say “living room” and “all” so I have the option to play music through living room speakers or throughout the house?

Echo plus side would be better Alexa integration... I don’t think Sonos one gives doorbell/motion alerts?

g0m3xe,1586794705,Perplexed by the lack of a wireless solution here,"I really hope there's a logical explanation beyond simply ""there isn't enough consumer demand"" for my specific use case.

Long story short, I have two TVs connected to my PC via 75 ft. fiber optic HDMI cables and both are in rooms that are both somewhat far from the PC and have lots of obstacles in between that interfere with bluetooth signals so much to the point where even Bluetooth 5.0 peripherals such as keyboards and game controllers can't operate. This is also true for RF  Wireless signals such as those given off by Logitech's USB dongles.

Some oddities that I have noticed:

1. There are tons of bluetooth receivers/extenders/repeaters on the market that appear to work just fine for audio devices like speakers and headphones but not a single one of them work with other peripherals.
2. Enter WiFi. Solutions such as Unified Remote and WO Mic allow you to use an Android device over WiFi to act as different types of peripherals. Thus, I know one solution would be to use this in combination with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse that is then connected to the phone. So, we know there are solutions that work over WiFi, yet there are no peripherals on the market aside from cell phones using apps that work over a WiFi signal.

So what gives? There's no question in my mind the technology exists. Are people who are looking to use their TVs as computer monitors really still SOL in 2020 unless said TVs are close to the PC or they are willing to use some wonky solution that requires use of an Android phone? If this is really the case, then I question what the point of long distance HDMI cables even is in the first place. What good is having a display 75 feet away if you can't even keep wireless peripherals connected at that distance?

Looking to today, we bought a house with a ton of kitchen (probably 16-20 ft of cabinets) and I want to add under-cabinet lighting to it. I use Google Home/Assistant via a Nest Home Mini and our phones, and would like to remain within that architecture. Purchase of a Zigbee or Zwave hub to tie them together isn't out of the question. Some recommendations I'd appreciate are as follows:

Reputable/reliable brand options for high density RGBW light strips? I'm looking for a double-width strip with the RGB and WW side by side. I'll probably go with aluminum tracks for ease of mounting.

Good controller to handle these? Must tie in with Google Home, or connect with a hub which ties into Google Home. Also power considerations to prevent signal loss from running the necessary lengths of LEDs. I can probably get creative with where I position the controller so as to split up my LED runs.

Motion sensing for the strips? As an eventual goal, I think it'd be cool to have motion sensing to where the RGB could be set to a color and the WW fades on and off at the section of countertop where motion is detected. This is long-term and could even be DIY, but a thought nonetheless.

I also considered the echo studio with the echo sub but that only works via FireTV and wouldn’t work for example if I’m playing games via PS4 — however meets all other criteria.

g0pvqf,1586806256,How to activate overhead lights with relay port signal,"Disclaimer: I am as unknowledgeable as one could possibly be, as I don’t have any experience with this whatsoever. Please excuse that I might be asking very simple questions. 

So, a little backstory first. I’m a volunteer firefighter in my community, and I’m sick of having to run across my dark bedroom to flick the light switch every time there’s an Alarm at night. 
My department uses the “airbus p8gr” pagers, which feature a relay output, in the form of a plug connector with one positive and one negative pole, on their docking station. This port is usually not active, and only gets powered when an alarm comes in

Now for my question. 
What would be the easiest/best way to set up a system in such a way that the powering of the relay port turns on the lights in three different rooms, my bedroom, the upstairs hallway and the downstairs hallway. Additionally, the system would have to keep the lights on for a set amount of time, in this case at least 3 minutes, as the relay port is only active for the duration of the alarm, or about 20 seconds. 
I figured that this would probably require wireless capable lightbulbs, like the osram smart+ lights. However, I have no idea on how to set up a system such as that, not do I know what parts I’d need to do so. 

I hope this question belongs in this subreddit

g0rx35,1586812867,Keeping Up with Alexa: April 10th,"Time for another Alexa Newsletter review. Here are the highlights. Link to the post is at the bottom for more detail.

## Takeaways

Here’s how the new commands break down for this week’s newsletter:

* Donations: 1
* Timers: 1
* Information: 2
* Alexa Skills: 4
* Smart Home: 2
* Jokes: 3
* Music: 3
* Alarms: 1
* Audible: 2
* Productivity: 2

Music, Audible and ambient sounds are the main themes this week. We have only one updated command for the pandemic, so we’re now seeing a slowdown in updates there.

### Music and Ambient Sounds

Music and ambient sounds had a big showing this week. Amazon really wants users to know about Alexa’s Ambient Sound abilities. And with added commands for changing the equalizer, we’re seeing more emphasis on music quality.

### Audible

Audible seems to get at least one command each newsletter so far, with this week being no exception. One of the commands is very much a bust, while the other could be useful with your kids at home.

Amazon tends to push Audible too hard on Alexa users. WIth one command, it feels like Amazon is using the notion of “free” as an opportunity to upsell.

### Alexa’s Xbox Integration

Alexa has very solid integration with Xbox. This isn’t too surprising these days. Microsoft has stopped using [Cortana to compete with Alexa ](https://www.cnet.com/news/cortana-reborn-microsofts-digital-assistant-becomes-less-alexa-more-productivity-app/)which benefits Alexa users in this case.

### Productivity Weaknesses

Amazon has a built-in to-do list with Alexa that doesn’t seem to integrate with any other known productivity systems out there. Although it does work, I find it pretty lacking. Just having a to-do list in Alexa isn’t compelling enough for the average user to switch from a system they already use, like the iOS Reminders App. Amazon needs to step up their game in this space.

### Donation Awareness

There are many organizations that accept donations that don’t actually use the money for what they say. This week’s donation command is a solid example. Although it says Coronavirus Relief, we don’t actually know where that money is going, or what it’s doing. Amazon doesn’t provide that information. Your dollars may not go to the right people to make an impact.

## Next Newsletter

That’s all for this week! Let’s see if we get another newsletter before the end of April. I’m thinking a monthly roundup of all the newsletters for the month might be useful, especially if we continue to get a weekly update from Amazon. Let me know if that’s something you would be interested in reading in the comments below.

I know you probably get these posts all the time but I’m currently in the process of developing a property and would like some advice in relation to home automation.

As part of this development, I’m looking for advice on what system(S) would best fit the capabilities I want in terms of home automation and AV. I have reached out to a number of local installers but wanted to also get some genuine impartial advice off you guys.

To give you some context, the property is in the UK and has 5 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, 2 lounges and a kitchen.

I am planning on visiting the show rooms of local installers, and also the crestron show room once the lockdown is relaxed.

Broadly, I’m looking for a system that has the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* four individual sound zones (kitchen, 2 lounges and master bedroom)
* Surround sound system cinema system for one of the lounges
* Lighting controlled throughout the property with 2 switches in each of the kitchen and lounges, and 3 switches per bedroom (one by the door and 1 either side of the bed).
* CCTV system with approx 8 cameras
* Climate control for the air conditioning and heating throughout the property
* iPads mounted in 4 places (kitchen, both lounges and master bedroom)
* Ability to close blinds / curtains throughout the property.
* Ability to give ""guests"" access to limited areas of the system, e.g sound, climate, lighting etc

It had an option for dimming but no matter what I did they would just flash when they dimmed from that dimmer. So then I went to the website and realized that there are 2 wires inside the fixture along with the 120v power wires that are purple/grey which is 1-10v dimming. 

I wanted to accomplish 2 things 1. be able to control with alexa/apple homekit, 2. dimming the panel lights if I didn't want them too bright. 

Now I am trying to find if there's another solution since I don't have the purple/grey wires going back down to the switch on the wall. Like does anyone have something that would allow me to hook up on top of the light fixture that connects to wifi/z-wave/etc which has an app so I can use it to dim the light fixtures and I'll swap out the switch on the wall with an on/off switch? I would even be ok with having both panel lights having their own wireless dimmable switch so I can control them independently.

Any ideas would be greatly apprecaited.

g0yn58,1586837662,Rope lights with Smart Switch,"Hey Everyone,

I have the following rope light that is in some crown molding on our ceiling. It's like this one: 

 [https://www.destinationlighting.com/item/american-lighting-led-flexbrite-kits-cool-white-180-inch-led-rope-light/P1310971#moreFrom](https://www.destinationlighting.com/item/american-lighting-led-flexbrite-kits-cool-white-180-inch-led-rope-light/P1310971#moreFrom) 

It's controlled by a switch down below and has the normal hot and line connection attached to the switch, and a neutral wire behind them. I was speaking with Zooz and they recommended a Zen30 switch which is for a fan/light combo. There reasoning was: ""*If the switch would be controlling a switched receptacle, we wouldn't actually recommend any of our light switches here since they're not rated for use with receptacles. If the inrush current for the LED strip power supply spikes too high, it may damage the electronics. Same if someone plugs in a motor device to the other outlet in the receptacle.""*

The only thing plugged into the switch is that specific rope light and nothing else. At the top is the plug for the rope, the extension cord(?) which then I assume is connected to the switch which powers the rope. Would I be able to use a normal smart switch for this application? Any advice or suggestions much appreciated! Thanks!",1willsolo,/r/smarthome/comments/g0yn58/rope_lights_with_smart_switch/,2,smarthome,1

*(If anyone can answer my question at the bottom of the page, I will be so grateful!)*

I have a 2019 Samsung TV and I've recently discovered that running simple commands from Terminal on my Mac can launch apps.

I've yet to set up a dedicated machine for Plex, so a spare Mac is my media server, I'm using that to run the commands after being triggered by Alexa.

[TriggerCMD](https://triggercmd.com/en/) is the application and it has an Alexa smart skill to link it all up.

The TV does need to have a static IP address for the commands, but it works very well.

The only trouble is getting the App IDs, but this post helps.

\*\*\*Can anyone help?\*\*\* (Answered)

I need the Disney App ID, like the numbers above in bold. Can anyone get that? I know by a trace-level debug that it can show all of the apps installed. Not sure how to go about doing that myself with the Tizen IDE.

**Update to the above question**

For my model, UE55NU7100, to turn on developer mode is quite simple.
Go to the apps page and press: 12345
Then enter the IP of your laptop/device and follow the instructions.

Then on your device install Tizen Studio, install the IDE package and look for the Device Manager.
I had to search for it on my mac to find it.
Add your device/tv via the IP (I did not change the port) and right-click.

The last option, Installed Web App List, will generate all the info you need to get the codes.

My codes: https://pastebin.com/WP5Hc9GD

**Update about TriggerCMD**

The ""Allow smart device"" pop up on your TV does get in the way of the automation.

You need to go to settings &gt; general &gt; external device manager &gt; device connection manager &gt; access notification &gt; off

This will now allow **anything** in your network to control/send commands to your TV.

Unfortunately the cables to two doors and a PIR sensor are broken. I pulled the sensors and verified a lack of continuity using a multi-meter. I’m guessing that the wires were damaged during installation and never checked. The cables don’t pull freely so replacing them without damaging ajacent cables is an expensive proposition.

My plan was to use z-wave sensors and then use an embedded controller to take signals from a hub and drive a pin high simulating a completed circuit. 

Right now my setup consists of homebridge running on an i7 Alienware laptop and a Hubitat hub. I also have 3 first gen raspberry pies lying around, a couple Arduinos and 2 ESP32 Arduino clones. 

Is there a recommended stack for bridging to a gpio device for input and output? I’d like to both emulate devices but also poll status until I replace the alarm panels/controllers.

Glossary (I am adding this as I am not sure if there are English words which differentiate both meanings of *switch*):
- *button switch*: a device (usually on a wall) which sends a ""I was clicked"" message, usually to MQTT (though some proxy such as Zigbee2MQTT, or a RF433 one like the Sonoff 433 Bridge)
- *power switch*: a device which opens or closes an electrical circuit (such as a Sonoff Basic, or a smart plug)

**I am looking for advice: should a *button switch* be registered in Home Assistant?**

I see Home Assistant as
- a state machine, where the **state** of my devices is maintained (power switches for instance, or Xiaomi temperature sensors) 
- a useful UI to change or check the **state** of these devices

At no time I interact in HA with the **action** of a *button switch*. All my automation is done in App Daemon (which receives the message from a *button switch*, and then alters the state of a device in HA)

**Is there therefore a reason for HA to know about the existence of my *button switches*?**

The first step was to replace the windows since the house is close to the freeway and the old single pane windows weren't cutting it. The lighting in this place is HORRIBLE and needs to be updated. The location, quantity and quality of lights in this house baffles me. I'm going to start from scratch and begin replacing the recessed lighting room by room starting with my bedroom.

For now all I have are several echos around the house and some smart TVs. Nothing else automated and no hubs. I'm happy to procure things as needed to help with integration and overall ease of use. Bonus points for expand-ability to control other things.

I'm looking for something I can control via an echo, smartphone app and switch. I prefer to have the ability to do this while I'm not at the house as well. I'd like it to be expandable so that I can control the entire home inside and out with one app. I like the look of a smaller 4-5"" fixture but don't want to sacrifice overall light output.

g1tjtd,1586962812,Question regarding LED strip lighting - Zwave,"Hi all,

I spent a few hours yesterday reading and researching this topic, So I have read most of the posts on this and other forums regarding LED strips, which has furthered my understanding quite a bit, but i still have a few questions about how it all goes together.

First, I have zwave throughout the house, mostly homeseer, and am planning on some sort of zwave implementation for RGB strip lighting (which seems to be harder to come by).  I have a few use cases, throughout various bits of the house i would like to do ceiling up-lights (behind crown).  In the kitchen, i'll probably stick with a higher CRI white only for under cabinet, and potentially an rgb either for ceiling, or under cabinet kick area.

For the RGB stuff, i am looking at the LED strips themselves from [superbrightled.com](https://superbrightled.com), an RGB + W (5 contact) led strip.  That will go to the z-wave rgb controller (one of either the monoprice one [link](https://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=308&amp;cp_id=30801&amp;cs_id=3080102&amp;p_id=36511&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2), the Qubino one looks identical to the monoprice controller, or the Fabrio, but that one is over twice the price of monoprice, so trying mono first.).  
and finally a 24V power supply.

(haven't purchased any of this yet, my plan is to get one of each / small setup area and test before i'm ready to fully commit)

My questions really come in around the power, dimming, and control.

for the simple white strips, they are easy i think.. Strip to a dimable power supply hooked up to a zwave dimmer switch, and good to go.

The RGB is a little more complex, as there is a RGB controller involved. If the z-wave rgb controller does the dimming, then realistically, the switch is going to be headless and relying on z-wave to tell the controller to dim. correct?  I dont believe i want to be (or should i be?) dimming the source 120V ac to the power supply, cause then the controller looses its power too.  If the switch is headless, i'm not 100% sure how to tie the dimmer into the controller, maybe just have to do pre-set scenes, in which case a switch vs dimmer might be better.  

  
Also regarding power, IF the controller is doing all the diming, would i be better off having a single larger 24V power supply for all the LED lights (I can easily locate in basement and run 24V up to kitchen and other locations..), vs individual power supplies attached to each run of LED strips. (Assuming the controller is able to dim to 0% / off )

And for anyone who has done  LED uplight, if the power supply has been local (near the LED), where / how have you located and hidden it?  I dont think installing in the wall cavity would be good unless accessible.

Footnote;  
I'm in Canada, which does complicate some of my purchase options. Aeotec looks nice, but out of stock. I've looked at Hue, but dont want to deal with adding a bridge in, and they are very expensive. Came across LIFX, which also look nice, but didn't see any z-wave options jumping out at me. I am kinda stuck on the zwave controllers to do things like motion at night in hallway, do 10% red lighting for a couple minutes (nightlight), or various other color - condition type settings.

g21fny,1586986947,Smallest Z-Wave contact sensor?,"Short version; I need the smallest Z-Wave (or Zigbee but I would prefer Z-Wave) contact sensor possible

Long version; I’m a coffee snob and prefer French press over drip or Keurig. To that end I am currently using an electric kettle with a smart plug in order to turn on the nettle remotely and begin the process of heating the water for my morning coffee. 

The kettle has safety features built in such that it can detect boiling and shuts itself off so it can’t boil itself dry or become a fire hazard. Thankfully the system functions in a way that I can flip the switch on the kettle whether there is power or not so 
1) Fill Kettle
2) Place on base
3) Flip switch to “arm” the system
4) Remotely apply power and Bob’s your uncle

When the kettle is removed from the power base the switch on the kettle automatically flips itself off cleverly using a mechanical switch inside that remains depressed so long as the kettle is sitting on the base. Pick it up and the “arm” switch defaults back to OFF. 

What I would like to do is use a small contact sensor in the base to detect the kettle being removed and turn off the smart plug via adding some magnets inside the bottom of the kettle so that no matter what orientation the kettle is in relative to the base (rotationally) there would always be a magnet engaging the sensor in the base.

I am very confident that heat will not be a factor for the magnets as there is plenty of space internally (not to mention the bottom of the kettle is plastic and doesn’t melt) during operation. But I’m less confident about the heat affecting the contact sensor hence my wish that it be in the base. 

Currently I have a teeny tiny little Wyze Sense contact sensor on hand but I would really like to use something that works with SmartThings natively (which Wyze unfortunately does not). 

That’s where things get awkward because I don’t have enough experience to have the faintest clue which sensors I should be considering so I’m hoping the group mind can help me out. Suggestions?",Venmaru,/r/homeautomation/comments/g21fny/smallest_zwave_contact_sensor/,1,homeautomation,21
g21o1s,1586987698,Can someone make a smart ac plug with a solid state relay for me?,"Hi,

I'd like to take a smart AC plug and switch out the mechanical click relay with a solid state one because I didn't see a prebuilt one with a solid state relay yet. I want to use it with an infrared heater that has no thermostat so that it's noiseless.

I can't find a tutorial on this that covers all the steps of swapping out relays so that it's fully comprehensible to me and this whole thing stresses me out

I just want a quiet radiator in my room that doesn't do clicking noises because I'm very noise sensitive, it makes me sick. Atm, I'm freezing at night and don't get proper sleep. (Can't put on thick blankets because I have hives and it will be very itchy)

If someone can build me one I'll pay him parts + shipping + 40€. I'm from Germany so someone from Europe would be optimal for cheap shipping. I can buy it off of you from ebay because I have a lot of reviews there so it's kind of better than doing it just via paypal.

g250d9,1586999049,When is a home really smart?,"As many here, I've become quite the smart home person (nerd?) over the years and the go-to for friends and family wanting to make their home ""smart"". 

That conversation always starts with the same question: ""What is it you actually want to do?""

And after a bit of back and forth, the conclusion is almost always the same. They just want to be able to turn some stuff on and off with their phones and *maybe* a with a voice assistant. 

&amp;#x200B;

**That isn't smart**

Maybe it's just me, but in my opinion that isn't making your home smart, that's having a fancy remote for your house. 

A home that is truly smart is able to make its own decisions, following rules you set. Decisions that actually make your life easier, because going into your phone, opening an app and pressing a button isn't making anything easier.

A basic example of a smart home is a home that unlocks the door for you when it knows you're about to come in. Or a home turning on the heater when it expects you to be cold. It doesn't require you to do anything. Your home looks after you and if it does it well, it goes completely unnoticed.

Having an alarm automatically arm and disarm is another example of something that makes your life easier. Not having to type in your code every time you exit and enter your home is a tangible difference in your day to day, plus you get the added benefit of never forgetting to arm.

These are just basic examples, but you can have windows and blinds that open and shut automatically to manage the indoor climate are ways you can save on heating and cooling costs. Opening your windows based on the wind direction to get the best cross draft isn't really something you would do yourself, but through automation you don't have to think about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do I care**

Obviously, to each their own. My parents have had Hue for years and despite me having offered to build them the world, they are content with just the lights, and I realise that for plenty of people stuff like this is overkill or they don't want it for some other reason. 

The reason I care is because there are also many that do want to add things later on, but don't realise that by going the ""easy"" route now, they're creating problems down the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The home of the hubs**

Say they want some cameras. Like how they ended up choosing Hue, they choose something that seems simple. They get some Wemo cameras. Then they decide a smart lock would be nice, so they get an August lock, because all the reviews are so good. 

By this point they have 3 sets of devices, each with their own hub and for everything you have to open an app on your phone to control it. None of it talks to each other, none of it is able to have the other set of devices do anything.

And as we see here all the time, people then realise they will need yet another device to be able to have all the devices talk to each other. I have a mate that has a shelf in his living room dedicated to all his hubs and bridges. One for his cameras, one for his door, one for his garage door, one for his lights, one for blinds, one for his alarm. All because he insisted that Apple Homekit was the best way to build a smart home. Because Apple mostly.

&amp;#x200B;

**The wondrous world of wifi**

Less frustrating, but equally a problem that could've easily been avoided. Those that build a complete network out of wifi devices. That have their 10 year old wifi router that they got from their ISP. That router was already cheap and barely capable then, but now they're adding wifi bulbs, wifi switches, wifi cameras, wifi doorbells and wifi speakers on top of their existing smart TVs streaming Netflix.

When and if these old routers finally give up, have fun [resetting](https://youtu.be/1BB6wj6RyKo) all those devices and reconnecting them to a new router. Only to find out the problem of congestion is most likely still just as present.

&amp;#x200B;

**The end of my rant**

Where I'm going with all of this, is that a lot of people, even here, don't fully realise that you're not buying these devices in your home for the next 1/2 years like a phone. Often not even for just the next 5/6 years like your TV. You might have these devices in your home for the next decade and use them every single day. You might rely on them for safety like smoke detectors or smart locks. Don't simply go for what websites like Engadget say is the best ""smart lighting system"", but think about where you want to go with your smart home and do some research. Find a solution that ticks all the boxes in the long term, not just for the next year or so.

I gather from reading posts here that the Alexa ecosystem is *not* very popular. However, for ease of use and interconnectivity I’m planning on an echo dot in bedrooms and bathroom, and an echo plus or echo show in the kitchen to act as a hub.

The main elements that will be controlled are devices (TV, Xbox, etc) along with the majority of the lighting in the home, and probably a ring doorbell and floodlight. Eventually I may be adding smart climate control of some type, but the infrastructure in my home is ancient and won’t accept that right now. 

My main question is whether or not the echo plus/show, given that the specs say they can act as a zigbee hub, can use zigbee to control hue bulbs, or if I’d still need a hue hub to do so. 

If I should abandon this plan all together and go a different direction, I’m open to arguments toward that. Just be aware that I’m not the type that will do a ton of tinkering. I’m more of an iPhone than an android, if that makes sense.

By default it uses the eWelink cloud but hopefully we will sooner or later see support for third-party ESP8266 firmware from projects like Tasmota for local control.

From the images it also looks like Itead is even reusing the same injection moulds as for the Sonoff RF Bridge 433 housing/enclosure, and popular third-party ESP8266 firmware projects like Tasmota and ESPurna already has support for that existing Sonoff RF Bridge.

I have a fair amount of wildlife in the backyard, and would like a way to zoom and and capture details if I happen to be watching when something interesting happens (or check the creek level if not). I think the best way to do that is with an outdoor PTZ that has optical zoom and a high grade camera sensor, preferably POE powered, and Surveillance Station compatible. I don't plan to use PTZ for ""patrolling"" or other non-live adjustment, so that component doesn't need to be of industrial grade.

I'll be mounting under a second story eve, so some zoom probably does matter.

I would like to know if there are options where the thermostat is just a component of the smart home, where a separate central ""brain"" does the controlling and communication with sensors but is not integrated into the thermostat.

* 11x Smart lights
* IR Controller
* Door Sensor

I'm wondering if there are settings, or if Google's voice assistance allows you to have basically zero audible feedback unless theres an issue ""I couldnt find that song"" would be acceptable, but if I ask the speaker to play a song I'd like it to just start playing.

The firmware updater is in the form of a driver. It is a utility based driver similar to the basicZwaveTool. It is designed to be switched to, used to update your devices, and then switch back to your original driver. 

While released exclusively to the Hubitat platform. This is not a product of Hubitat Inc. This is a community developed and community supported feature. 

## Use at your own risk ##
I am providing this as a convenience for the community and as such make no guarantees or warranties. If you damage a device from proper or improper use of this program you are on your own.

## Requirements:  ##
* Web server hosted OTZ or HEX update file. (can be local on your LAN or elsewhere ex: github
* Z-wave device that is OTA capable and supports Firmware Update MD Command Class V1-4 
* Good connectivity between the device and your Hubitat hub. 

## Warnings: ##
* Devices that are region specific, make sure you have a firmware file that is for your region.
* Some devices will require exclude/include when complete. This has been noticed on some hardware. Most will not require this.
* There are many provisions in this code and in the Z-wave spec that prevent this process from damaging your device. But I offer no guarantee or warranty. **Use at your own risk!**
* **This driver can only be used on 1 device at a time due to the shared memory requirement to enable this process.** 

## Process: ##
1. Go to the device details page for the device you want to update
2. Under device information change the driver to **Z-Wave Firmware Updater** and click **Save Device**
3. Type in the URL for the firmware update file in the **Update Firmware** command and then click Update Firmware
4. Wait.. This process can take a while
5. Watch under Current States for progress updates. 

At any time you can click **Abort Process** to stop the firmware update.

In the rare case of the process being locked from a previous attempt, you can click **Clear Lock** to clear the stale lock.

After clicking the **Update Firmware** button this process can take a while.. The firmware must be downloaded and processed into memory. Then must be parsed for information to verify that the firmware matches the device's firmware image. Only after all these steps will the device begin requesting parts of the firmware binary. You will see a progress indicator reporting the percentage of data that has been transferred. After the whole image has been transferred your device will verify it to and reply back with a status. And then if the status is good your device will flash itself and reboot.

## Note for sleepy (battery powered) devices: ## 
Throughout this process you may need to wake the device a few times before everything can be completed. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for the wake mechanism for your device.

Separate from our main house, we have an outbuilding. WiFi coverage over there is horrible, so I'm getting ready to add an AP via an Ethernet drop I managed to get over there through an existing conduit. I want to add a little smarts over there (thermostat and fire alarm listener to start, maybe some switches later).

My WiFi system is Ruckus with R610 access points. As luck would have it, the R610 has a little two port managed switch built into it, so even after connecting the outbuilding AP via Ethernet I can still have a hardwired Ethernet drop in the outbuilding. 

My current plan of action was to add a second ST hub over there, connected to that Ethernet drop. That would require me to set up a second ""location"" in ST for all the stuff in the outbuilding. 

Is there a better way to do it? I know the R610s have IoT capability via an add on adapter, but not sure if that can be leveraged by a ""consumer"" system like ST or HA.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the middle of a Kitchen renovation and I started out by not having a smart kitchen.  Then I went searching for a dimmable, 3 way, smart switch and here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I have purchased a HomeSeer as my hub.  Currently, I have 3 sets of lights in my kitchen.  Overhead main lighting which is controlled by a Zwave, 3 way dimmer.  It goes to 6 LED recessed lights. 

Next I have pendant lights, Zwave 2 way dimmer

Then the task lighting (cabinet lights).  I am stumped on this one.  

So currently, I have a switch in a 3 gang outlet (nothing smart, yet).  I have an outlet in a cabinet to hide wiring/controllers/etc (the switch controls this outlet).  I want the lighting controlled with the HomeSeer.  I was originally just going to get a Zwave switch, a dimmable LED power supply and hook it to some white lights, but I know thats a really limited function, especially since I have 6 wire 22awg ran.  So can I get a Zwave controller for RGBW or RBGCCT, and hook it to a dim able power supply? And that power supply gets controlled by the outlet?  Or should the power supply be on a constant on outlet and the controller is controlled independently by that Zwave switch?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - How should I wire a Zwave switch to some cabinet lighting to control with HomeSeer?  I would like RGBW control. Do I need a switched outlet to turn this off and on?",engineerfreely,/r/homeautomation/comments/g3n1bj/help_with_kitchen_reno_and_smart_lighting/,1,homeautomation,2

My question deals with detection of food theft by my housemates. I was gonna get the wyze starter kit and use the contact sensors for when they access my areas. The only problem is the pantry is a public space. I was wondering if anyone knew of any possible solutions to detect food theft as it’s happening? Just in terms of passive detection, nothing obvious like cameras. My first thought was to get something like a large area force sensitive resistor spread on my shelf, like something that could detect changes in mass not caused by me. Another one would be a motion detector from wyze wedged underneath the shelf above mine. 

Let me know what you guys think!

Edit: forgot to add that the reason I don’t think the force sensitive resistor wouldn’t work is because it doesn’t come in large enough of an area

Edit 2: hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for all the comments and suggestions. I was honestly surprised to see that the number one piece of advice was “just talk to them”.

So I thought I would include a few basic links, ""Security"" will come from your level of understanding and the time and effort you want to put into learning this. Cost is negligible as a lot of security is ""free"" just takes time and knowledge to install it. I think the basics have been covered but I just wanted to say if you buy from a reputable brand they will have better support and more likely to patch any vulnerabilitys.

g498gf,1587309107,Anyone have a good tutorial for creating video collages with FFMPEG (or any other software)?,"I currently have a 16 camera Ubiquiti Video setup.  It works great - I am even able to use them to trigger MQTT events, so I have motion sensors that are clearly defined image areas on my video feed.  So, for example, I have the 3 ft area in front of our front door set to ring the doorbell and send a notification when it sees motion (unless the door is unlocked, indicating someone from inside opened it).  I also use Monocle Gateway to enable me to view video from any of the cameras on my Echo Show devices.  Its super useful - my office is in the way back of the house, but I can have it show our driveway camera while Im working, so I dont feel so isolated and tucked away.

As you can imagine, I use video, and specifically video on the echo show A LOT.  However, one major issue is the fact that on the Echo Show, I can only show one camera at a time.  Id like to see a mosaic/collage, similar to how the Ubiquiti web interface works.  I have a pretty robust VM cluster that can handle a 24/7 load, so I was wondering if anyone had a guide to how to set up a server to take multiple RTSP streams, create a video mosaic, and then expose this as a new RTSP stream?  That way, I could actually view all of my cameras at once, and it would be amazing.",jgilbs,/r/homeautomation/comments/g498gf/anyone_have_a_good_tutorial_for_creating_video/,1,homeautomation,5

g4cs2i,1587321262,Yesterday I learned why WiFi is bad lol,"So the short version; ISP provider modem/router unit went bad and had to be replaced. 

We installed the new box and as expected things were so much better. I was seeing literally 10 times faster speeds and my daughter wasn’t running into the room every three minutes informing us that her iPad wasn’t working. 

I honestly already knew the lesson I was about to learn, that WiFi isn’t an ideal system for automation hardware, so I really have very few items that use it (currently three little Gosund wall wart plugs). I went through all my stuff in my Home Automation folder in my phone app by app changing the WiFi for devices as I went (MySmartBlinds, Wyze, Blink, Bose, Sonos, Nexx, Family Hub, EcoBee, etc etc etc) and while it wasn’t terribly frustrating I immediately was grateful that I opted for Z-Wave switches and sensors because once the SmartThings hub booted up with its hard wire connection.......everything just worked. No muss no fuss. I kept imagining what a nightmare it would be if I had gone with WiFi devices instead. 

Today my father-in-law tells me they had to change their modem/router as well......so I’ve been trying to go through fixing his stuff which is all WiFi and #FML

So the lessons I took away from the experience are somewhat twofold. WiFi devices (while they do have their place and you simply can’t fully eliminate all of them) are definitely not ideal. Z-Wave is so much easier and anything that CAN be hardwired to the network SHOULD BE. 

If you’re into home automation, you’re probably more of a power user than your average bear, whether you’re just sort of techish or a full blown geek and you should probably consider ditching the ISP provided hardware and simply install a modem and your own WiFi (mesh). That way even if you change ISPs or whatever the only way your WiFi could change would be if your mesh died. You could change providers a million times and your WiFi would always be the same so all of your devices simply jump right back onto the network. 

That’s my next project.......buying a modem and mesh setup and ditching the combo unit. I used the same logic 18 years ago when I bought my first domain name......we moved around a lot after we got married and every time we did our ISP changed which meant our email addresses changed which was a pain in the ass. Owning my own domain means no matter where we are our emails are always the same in the same manner as providing my own WiFi.",Venmaru,/r/homeautomation/comments/g4cs2i/yesterday_i_learned_why_wifi_is_bad_lol/,1,homeautomation,21

# Takeaways

Alexa Skills, cooking and information are the main themes from Amazon. Like last week, we only have one command for the pandemic. Even still, it’s only mildly related as it’s household cleaning tips.

One of the promoted skills, Find My Phone, definitely has shady practices going on, like immediately sending newsletters to Alexa users who try the skill, charging users without any upfront warning, and using an unusual signoff of “see ya.” For more info, check out the [Alexa Skills section](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-17th/#Alexa_Skills).

On the flip side to this disaster of a command, Amazon shows off some of its intelligence with its note system. My favorite command this week being, “Alexa, make a note.…” For more info as to why, check out the [Productivity section](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-17th/#Productivity).

Another great command from this week promotes free Harry Potter. Until May 1st, you can get *Harry Potter* book one read to you for free from Audible.

g55dg5,1587430721,Newbie to home automation. What Hub to get?,"Hi all,

New to the whole home automation thing!  Last fall I set up a doorbell and some wireless cameras (night owl) around the exterior of my house.  Didn't have much time to research and get it set up...kinda needed it urgently, and that's what Walmart had in stock...I wish I'd have had some time...cuz it kinda sucks!

Well, now I've got a bit of time for the rest of my home security(ish) system, and I figured I'd just get a home automation system set up for just that!

Mainly, I need door and window sensors.  I have a son who is  prime to wandering, and I'd like a motion sensor on his door (we keep it open just a crack), and sensors on all the windows and doors he could get out from.  I'd like something that will alert me (txt or app notification) if he moves his door at night.

I saw that smartthings has a multisensor that seems to have an accelerometer in it, so I'll probably end up getting a bunch of those, for his room and the other doors and windows.

Now, here's the big question...what Hub should I get?
I've read that the smartthings hub is a solid choice, but I also saw this hubitat one, and liked the fact that it is all locally networked, and not reliant an internet connection.

And lastly, are there any cameras that could hook into a system like that?  I've got 1 spot where I could replace my Night Owl camera with a POE camera, since it is right next to my home office!  But I haven't really researched too deep into that yet!

g5att1,1587454371,Smart dimmer neutral and ground woes,"Hi all! I’m hoping somebody can help guide me in the right direction here. I recently attempted to install a smart dimmer module made by NOTSEK, on amazon. (rwjf-02a dimmer also sold as bresuve) I’ve used this model previously on another floor of my house and it’s been great for months now. 

The reason I’d like to use a dimmer module that is hidden is because I really love brass and pearl inlaid light switches that are throughout the house from when it was built. 

Now, when I installed the dimmer switch- it connected to WiFi just fine in the smart home app and all that good stuff. However any time that I turned the lights on they blinked at the fixture in a rhythmic pattern; no matter how bright or dim I set them. 

Some of the other forums mentioned that this seems to be a problem confined to smart dimmers and not smart switches. 

After searching on different forums and previous questions, it seems that this particular module will behave this way if the neutral at the switch and the light fixture are not both “bonded” to ground. There is no ground wiring for the particular circuit I’d like to have a dimmer on, and it is not feasible to run one. 

So, I ordered the Shelly dimmer. It seems to be more advanced, with more features and I’m hoping higher quality; i am not set on any particular brand though because I use my voice assistant to control the light level. My question is- before I start opening up everything in my wall again; am I not capable of having a smart dimmer with the wiring in this circuit? Or is there a better option than the Shelly dimmer module that would not have me replacing my actual switches? I know although my wiring is “grandfathered” in- it is not always ideal in comparison with newer wiring methods comprised since it’s installation; especially with new technology like this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and allowing me to pick your brains. Happy automating!

EDIT: here is a video showing the on/off rhythm of the lights. They flicker at the same speed no matter what the brightness was set too; although they dim well without typical “led flickering” they are GE g25 led bulbs

g5hukx,1587484709,Mix of halogen and smart LED lights on a single switch panel,"So I am thinking of changing lights in my kitchen for which I'd need to get an electrician in...

Currently, the setup is as follows:-

    8x MR16 ceiling downlighters
    4x G4 cabinet downlighters
    Both controlled independently by a dual dimmer

Now I was thinking to change the MR16s to smart LED-based GU10s, for which I would probably need to change to a toggleable on/off switch. However, I note that there's pretty much no G4 LEDs out there, smart or not, so these would need to remain as a regular dimmer, I imagine

So I was wondering what my options would be in terms of controlling these lights be? I note that there's such a thing as dual panels that features both a dimmer switch and an on/off switch (something similar to https://www.supersockets.co.uk/product/25617/Trim-Rounded-Polished-Chrome-Dimmer-and-Light-Switch-Combination) but that feels a bit awkward for some reason.

g5io45,1587487341,Whole House Fan Switch Replacement,"Two days ago I replaced a potentiometer / knob switch for a whole house bathroom fan with a [GE 14291 Enbrighten Z-Wave On/Off switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1AHC3R/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_zBigCbQK6M76X?th=1). The original knob switch / fan only worked in one setting so there shouldn't be a variable voltage aspect to this.

The GE switched worked great. But by the end of the day, the switch was physically unresponsive and off the network. I cycled the fuse for it and it came back to life, and died about a few hours later. I popped it open and the voltages are hitting the GE Zigbee switch correctly.

I could use an opinion on if either of these seem more likely:

1. It could be a bad switch, plenty of Amazon reviews saying the GE switches are hit or miss, I just happened to have good luck with them until this.
2. Could the draw of the fan be too much for the switch, and I need to get a beefier switch?

I'm concerned it's option 2. If it is, I was looking at picking up a [1000 watt switch](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Incandescent-Required-Works-SmartThings-14299/dp/B07361Y54Z) or a [fan controller.](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Enbrighten-Required-SmartThings-14287/dp/B06XTKQTTV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=GE+Enbrighten+Fan+control&amp;qid=1587486999&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-1) I shouldn't need the fan controller but \*assume\* it's better designed for this type of work than the GE light switches are.

Since I got my hands on Sonoff Micro, I thought I would do something fun with it. One of the ideas was actually pitched to me on r/Tasker where someone wanted to avoid overnight charging.  Modern devices can handle prolonged charging well, but charging doesn't have to last all night.

In addition to this, you will see how to ""recognise your charging dock"" with a gravity sensor rather than NFC.

Here is the overnight profile for my wireless charger:

* charging started at approx 10pm
* 100% achieved around midnight
* 90% trigger at approx 7am
* 98% on the phone when I got up at 8am

g5lw7f,1587497477,Wemo vs. ESP8266-based Treatlife/Gosund devices for use with HomeKit?,"Hey everyone. I recently set up Homebridge to get my existing Nest thermostat to show up within HomeKit and I'm now looking to add some plugs, switches, and dimmers to my setup. I've been doing a lot of reading and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by all the different options out there, so hopefully I can narrow things down a bit.

My goal is to get everything working with HomeKit and Alexa. I think Wemo devices support everything I want out of the box, but I'm finding a lot of other (cheaper) devices and I'm curious if I could get them working in the same way.

In particular I'm looking at the Treatlife DS01 dimmer, SS01S switch, and the Gosund WP6 plugs. These all seem to be based on the ESP8266 and are sold under various brands.

It seems like I have the following options:

* Use the included Tuya service and set up homebridge-tuya-web to make the devices show up in HomeKit.
* Flash the devices with Tasmota or ESPHome. Built-in Alexa support, but for HomeKit it seems like I'd also have to set up an MQTT broker and manually configure each device within Homebridge.
* Flash the devices with the ESP8266 Arduino core and use [this project](https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266) to add HomeKit support. I'm not sure if this includes Alexa support, but I think I could use homebridge-alexa to fix that.
* Flash the devices with Home Accessory Architect to get HomeKit support, but I think this has the same issue with Alexa.
* There's also the option of switching to Home Assistant but I'm not sure whether this would actually help with what I'm looking for. (I do already have an Apple TV device set up as a HomeKit hub if that makes a difference.)

Of these options, it seems like using the Tuya service would be the least fiddly option, but I'm not opposed to tinkering a bit if it leads to a better outcome. I'm tempted to just go with the Wemo devices for simplicity, but being able to get everything for half the price (or less) is appealing, and it seems like it could be a fun project if I could decide on a path forward.

I'm trying to learn new things around wifi. I have Google Wifi with a total of 4 pucks, with 3 Nest Wifi routers on the way after finding out they're faster than the nest wifi points and gen1 google wifi. I just read yesterday about Moca adapters, and my house was previously wired with coax in many rooms so that's now on my mind instead of trying to get rewired for ethernet at some point. I have 500mb/s cable internet now with 1gb fiber being installed this weekend. 2 story house plus basement, and a detached garage that has a rented out studio on top.

I wanted to add this to my home automation server so I could **inch** anything I want - turns out it was a slightly more complicated task than just applying a custom delay. Possible uses: lights with timeouts, garage doors, contacts that need longer activation and more...

My NodeRED implementation features:

* custom timeout
* the single payload on output (even via dashboard switch)
* ability to cancel and reset 
* dashboard and logic compatible
* single node 

All wrapped in the form of a tutorial in NodeRED and JS :  [https://notenoughtech.com/home-automation/nodered-home-automation/inching/](https://notenoughtech.com/home-automation/nodered-home-automation/inching/)

Last night my roomba got stuck with an error 17 in a place that it should have been just fine (there was ope space on 3 sides) and one of the reasons cited was that it could be too dark for the roomba to see. Sigh. 

My roomba runs out of battery 2/3rds through the first floor and it has to go back and charge.  I would like to trigger a Lutron lighting scene when the roomba leaves the cradle and another when it returns.  (Which will happen to two times typically during a night cleaning, with a  &gt;1 hour pausing charge.) iRobot reactivated the IFTTT integration.

g631m7,1587568915,Google Home vs Alexa,"Opinion. Google Home is just better.

I've tried both. Google Home feels more natural.

In all of my usability tests, Google has worked out to be the better solution.

Alexa consistently feels ""robotic"", setting up skills, getting the commands just right, the responses, the settings.

With Google Assistant, you're in a family place if you use it for search and general voice assistance. Also, you can just throw commands at it immediately after setup and test out different ways to say it. It gets it right on 90% of my first guesses.

Also, Vizio makes great affordable TVs, the integration is seamless.

Example. When Netflix pauses the show and asks ""Are you still there?"" *on-screen button:continue watching*""

My instinct was to ask Google Assistant ""continue watching on the living room TV"".... Boom. Total guess based on what I see, worked.

Set up a bunch of different lights (different brands) and naturaly assigned them to rooms. No sequences set up yet....... Hmmm. I wonder.... ""Hey Google. Turn off all lights in the house"".....

We've tried other things like letting it start somewhere far from the base and then find the base and that worked one time but then we tried to do it for another room it failed to map and it didn't work and then said the map was invalid. 

We called their support and they were pretty useless, essentially told us we either map it all at once or every time it would just be a new map.

What I want to do, as a starter: 

Monitor room temperature and appliance electricity usage for graphical display on a spare desktop monitor. - Just to do it.

Schedule appliance power by time, ambient light, and motion. - I'd like to set various lights to turn on/off at a specific time, like when I get up for work, and they turn off after I leave for work, and some other lights to turn on whenever dusk hits, and others when I walk in a room, and it's dark.

Temperature control by time/day (individual 7-day). - I have an odd schedule, and also, I don't understand why typical programmable thermostats include M-F, then S/S, when you're always up later on Friday night than a Sunday night. If I'm going to spend the 6 million dollars for a 7 day, I might as well go bigger for the same price.

Device history and Reporting. - How long was outlet 2B being used last month? How much electricity did I use overall? Stuff like that.

My dealbreakers so far are:

Alexa/Google, absolutely. Any similar walled garden exclusivity, probably.  
Any required external service or cloud-based.  
Only having a phone app.

Hi guys im starting to build a smart home environment and realized that if i wanna go with WiFi based smart devices instead of zigbee or z-wave which are more expensive and require a hub i should start by having really good internet and wifi.

I had a Roomba and was a big influence on him to buy it. I strongly suggested buying one with wifi and that re could schedule it. Mine does not have those functions and it bothers me a bit.  

So he researched a bit and the Deebot 500 seemed like a cheap, but good choice.  

When it arrived, he called me and we tried setting it up. Here’s what we used:  

Network: Tenda Nova MW3 (temporarily set up for 2.4Ghz).  

Phones: iPhone XR and iPhone 7+ both on IOS 13.4 

iPad Air (2013) and iPad (2018) on IOS 10 and IOS 13. 

IOS App: EVOVACS HOME 1.4.2.        

Deebot Firmware: 1.1.1

We couldn’t do it. And we’re not very stupid. We loaded the app, started the process but the issue was that when we tried to connect the phone/ipad to the deebot the wifi (ECOVACS\_XXXX) went missing and connection failed.  

I searched online and found lots of people complaining that it couldn’t get it to work.  

 

The solution: use an Android phone.  

 

My thought: iPhones to lots of things when connecting to a wifi. Apparently the Deebot couldn’t handle it all and that’s when the wifi module restarted (or something like that) because the network would disappear and reappear in a while.  

I got an old Android Phone (Samsung S3 with CyanogenMod 13/Android 6.0.1), installed the latest version of the Ecovacs Home App (v.1.4.3) and the first time it failed, but the ECOVACS\_XXXX wifi was still there and could hold a connection.  

So I first connected to the ECOVACS, opened the app, started the procedure, than connected to the TENDA Wifi and proceeded with the app setting. It WORKED!  

Once the Deebot was connected to the wifi it appeared on the iPhone app (if logged with the same username).  

So if you’re having that issue, try this.

g6g3nw,1587615385,Solar powered smart floodflights?,Hi im wondering if anyone knows of such a device? A floodlight that can be solar powered with a motion detector that can be connected to alexa via WiFi. The reason im asking is because my outside walkway light died recently and i believe its the wiring because i replaced the switch and the bulb and did some of the wiring myself but nothing seemed to fix it so its my guess the ground wiring is broken. This means when i get home late at night and walk to my door from my driveway i cant see shit and i got probably an 80 ft walkway. So it came to my mind it may be useful to get a solar powered motion detected floodlight installed near the driveway. It would be nice though if i could control the motion and how long the light stays on via alexa because i figure often times those motion detected lights dont stay on as long as i want. Or perhaps i would be able to pair it with a motion detector facing me so it turns on and lights up the path before i start walking up the walkway.,masterchubba,/r/homeautomation/comments/g6g3nw/solar_powered_smart_floodflights/,1,homeautomation,1

I was shocked to discover that they do not provide a method of 2FA for this account, which literally provides a backdoor into your network along with audio/video of your home.

Not only that, when I wrote into their support, an engineer wrote back saying that I don't need 2FA and to just use a strong password and not to worry.

I'm not going to share the full email because in all caps at the bottom they actually threaten against sharing the contents of the ticket with anyone.

Thankfully I have my Deco kits going into a router from another vendor, so it shouldn't be hard to just blacklist the IP ranges that the Deco and Kasa units are reaching out to, but still.

TP-Link's attitude towards security is wholly unacceptable given the responsibility we give them each time we put their cameras and microphones in our homes and our data in the hands of their networking hardware.

My HA system is based on a raspberry pi running OpenHab with a z-stick for control of z-wave devices. 

In 2017 when I was making decisions on the setup, z-wave seemed like the way to go for reasons that I couldn't explain now. Anyways, since then I've managed to find z-wave devices that fit my needs (mostly switches and plugs, and a couple sensors). 

As I look out over the home automation landscape right now, it seems like wifi-based Alexa/Google compatibility is becoming more ""standard."" This is great (I guess) for people who don't want to have to deal with a hub, and don't mind adding additional devices to their wifi networks. I suspect that this is edging out z-wave devices (helped along by the fact that the more popular hubs have dual z-wave/zigbee radios). 

For example: I'm running into a bit of frustration trying to find tunable white LED lights that use z-wave. I'm seeing one brand on Amazon, and the price for one bulb is almost as much as a four pack of ZigBee bulbs with the same functionality. 

It  will be pretty easy to add ZigBee support to my existing hub, the only additional cost being a different z\* controller. I'd just rather avoid having a whole different network running for one additional device. So -- if I go ZigBee here, I'm going to start leaning ZigBee only in the future -- to the extent that someday I might decide to replace my z-wave only devices in the coming years.

So... is ZigBee destined to be the dominant player (at least until something completely different (Thread?) comes along)?",sparklemotiondoubts,/r/homeautomation/comments/g6scmq/time_to_transition_from_zwave_to_zigbee/,3,homeautomation,11

Additionally, I can't ever imagine my life fitting into some sort of routine that I could set on a timer or base on a motion sensor. I'm the kind of person who sets a thermostat schedule and then still messes with it every single day because I'm still too hot/cold.

But what I'd love to do is add a remote to my bedside table that controls the overhead light so I don't have to get out of bed. Or tie the 6! light switches in my kitchen to a master on/off switch. And if I can do all that on my phone, while not making any actual light switch useless, then great!

Goals would be existing all wall switches continue to function (even if I need to replace them). All functionality can be executed via wall switch or remote.

I hope I ended on the right subreddit. If not, I'm sorry.

TLDR : I'm looking for a HDMI switch that will power the TV on when a device is active and will switch between all my devices when they become active.

-------

I bought a new TV some months ago to put in our basement. It only has 3 HDMI input, one of them being ARC for our soundbar, which leave 2 HDMI ports.

I have actually 3 devices : A Chromecast Ultra, a Steam Link and a Nintendo Switch. The Chromecast and Link both power the TV on when casting from a device or waking up using a controller. The TV would switch between the HDMI ports automatically too.

The Nintendo Switch won't power the TV on, nor switch to the right input.

I bought a HDMI switch ([this one](https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/gp/product/B06XGB78MG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)). The Chromecast won't show an image on screen, and anyway it won't switch between active devices. So I'll have to return it.

Now I have another TV with a HDMI switch too. This one is active (has a power cord). The TV itself does not have CEC capabilities so I wouldn't know if my devices would power the TV on, and I can't test it on my new TV. Nevertheless, it will switch the input to the Nintendo Switch when it is powering on. Nothing being perfect tho, it won't switch to the Chromecast when casting something. But I have a universal remote that works fine.

So I'm looking for a HDMI switch for by basement TV that will : powers the TV on when a signal is detected, switch inputs when casting content or powering on the Nintendo Switch. In fewer words, I'm looking for a perfect HDMI switch. Could you guys help me please?

g6z6jn,1587690976,DIY Alexa Skill For Controlling Your PC,"So for the past couple of years I have been developing my own Alexa skill to use internally at my apartment with all my devices. The video has been around for a while now, and the skill (and really the underlying server code) can do a lot more than it could when I took this video.  At some point I will take an updated video, it is a bit time consuming to go through all the features.

Anyway, I wanted to share not really the video, but a new site I have been working on (and accompanying GitHub page with code) for anyone interested in creating this yourself. I know it is a pretty common ask (controlling your PC), and I have seen some other options out there, but nothing that really walks you through setup and configuring your own skill. 

For those out there who like to understand how something works and build their own solutions, this will likely appeal to you over something you can download or add as a skill from the store. I have kind of branched away from the Alexa side of things, and instead have been focusing on developing an app for my Smart Watch. It will do many of the things the Alexa skill can, and once that is complete I will likely look to do some type of write up on that as well. 

*Don't beat me up on the website too much please it was one of my first goes at creating one. I don't really do much on the front end of things.*

Now the challenge: how would you guys tackle this? I have some requirements:

1. I do need the lights to be on when my curtains are closed, and I don't have any automation on them - yet.
2. When I open my curtains and it's not dark outside (and thus there is enough light in my room), the lights should turn off.
3. When it's starting to get dark outside, the lights should turn on.

At first I looked into some kind of ambient sensor, which I can place in a stationary place in my room. But after thinking of a real world implementation, this wouldn't allow me to implement requirement 2.  This because I'm unable to rely on the ambient sensor when the lights are turned on.

g7mfmq,1587784371,Why we automate; thoughts on motivation,"Home automation is, ostensibly, about efficiency in a multitude of potential avenues. A very common “problem” solved through automation is “people forget to turn lights off” which has the potential to save you money over time. More and more, though, homes are being equipped with LED lighting that is already so efficient that any such savings border on the inconsequential. For actual financial “savings” the math favors a smart thermostat and wise programming over any lighting trickery. 

Another goal of automation is a matter of convenience and quality of life which is much more difficult to quantify. Some of my automations like lights that come on as you enter a space without needing to intervene via a switch, while often simple and seemingly pointless, tend more towards “Its neat and makes me smile” rather than being TRULY useful. But that simple “makes me smile” goes a long way towards quality of life. 

Quite possibly one of the most amazing items in my arsenal are the windows blinds.........they’re motorized and connected via a central hub through the whole house and can be programmed to open and close on a schedule without human intervention!!!

Why is that such a big deal, you ask? Well; in our previous home (and in so many homes of so many people I know) blinds are rarely touched and left closed around the clock. It’s simply a hassle to wander through the house two, three, four times a day opening and adjusting and closing them. 

Instead the blinds in the bedroom slowly open over a five minute period in the morning to help us greet the day, they close around bedtime both for privacy and preparing the house for sleep by blocking out light from outside, so when I wake up in the morning I can look out at my lawn (I’m an old man 😂 my lawn means a lot to me) and when I come home it’s to a cheerfully lit home instead of a cave. 

It’s hard to calculate the value of the things that bring one joy......but believe me when I say that home automation (while arguably superfluous) makes me happy and absolutely improves the quality of life in my home. Doesn’t hurt that it’s a lot of fun.",Venmaru,/r/homeautomation/comments/g7mfmq/why_we_automate_thoughts_on_motivation/,9,homeautomation,19

I recently bought a 3 pack tp-link deco p9. Everything works fine except for my living room lights. The Magic Home Pro app, as well as Alexa api can not reach the device.

Not being able to switch on/off the lights is really annoying.

Please note the system works well with a tp-link C5 router as well as with a Huawei q2 pro mesh system. 

What I tried so far: IPv6 on/off, fast roaming on/off. Each time I reseted the device. It works a few times, and then even if I see the device in the deco app, it is unreachable by the app and Alexa.

I also enabled port forwarding. Same thing.

The only way to reach it is to add to the black list, thern remove it. I can turn on/off the light a few minutes, then it becomes unreachable.

Also I plan on having a media server eventually for all my data and plex. So yeah first goal will be lights and then second goal will be blinds. 

Goals:

automate rgb lights by motion detection or modes

automated blinds

sensor for mailbox

works offline, no cloud connection

preferably be able to use voice commands

usable by people ignorant of the system

maybe automated heating? I live at a rental. Dont know if this is possible

automated televison set up opening my tv, my shield and my reciever on in one button. 

stream music to other parts of the home to other speakers 

remote finder

For home theater:
When you press play, dim the lights gradually over 7 seconds. When you press pause, bring the lights up by 30%.

remote doorbell

not that crazy interested in home security but would like to be able to expand to it later 

Automate robot cleaner

Measure energy usage

g82lo6,1587853223,Best tablet / Pi etc. for touchscreen automation controller?,"My automation setup is sufficiently mature that I could really use a touchscreen in a few rooms to control it. I'm thinking of running via Home Automation, so while I'm interested in the latest / best touchscreen layouts etc. I'll ask that question when I'm ready to setup.

**More urgent is finding the right kind of touchscreen for the wall mounted display / controls** (I already have a solution for hosting Home Automation)

My basic requirements are:

\- **Power-able via USB-C** (I'm migrating my entire household to USB-C). This is typically the binding constraint right now for most cheap options. Definitely an aesthetic component here ... so type-C to micro-USB is not an option (but would be for more reasonable people).

\- Ideally **configurable / setup-able** via some scalable remote solution like Ansible / Puppet etc. (so pure Linux preferred) + certs / keys etc. Why? whats the point of messing around half-assed with homerolling a solution when you can whole ass it? Also - I'd like these to last \~5 years ... and I'm not looking forward to re-configuring / updating  \~3-4 of them manually.

\- **MoDeRn Os** \- Yes I know that Android 7+ is probably all I need, but I'd really like to be able to run a modern Linux kernel (\~5) or Android 10

\- I'd like a fairly **high quality screen** but size isn't super important 6-10 inches is fine... Hoping to use the camera as proximity sensor and perhaps adding on a reflective layer (won't work with capacities screens). I've dreamed various magic mirror setups but this is the [cheapest not ugly frame](https://www.waveshare.com/13.3inch-magic-mirror.htm) I can find. \[edit\] I'd happily give up on the USB-C if there was a cheap tablet with a modern OS and low backlight bleed.

\- **Cheapish** ... I'd like to have \~3-4 in various rooms in the house. Best option seems to be a $75 re-furb Win 10 Tablet. Can we do better?

Reasonable options I've found are:

$80- $100: Slap together A Pi4 ($35-45) + a 7 inch touchscreen ($50-60). Would be clunky, but maybe I could 3d print a reasonable case. Would not support an unplug and move around the house option.

$100-$150: Get a HD10 next time it's on sale (\~$100) and wait for Lineage 17 to be available for it. (slow)

**$75: Get a refurb** [**cheap Win 10 tablet**](https://www.newegg.com/hp-608-g1-pro-tablet/p/0VG-005K-00090?Description=hp%20tablet&amp;cm_re=hp_tablet-_-9SIA5GCA8J2158-_-Product&amp;quicklink=true) **and install Linux**. Seems like the best option right now. Can anybody suggest something better than this?

Do folks have other options or suggestions? I had initially hoped that I could get a cheap Arduino board + touchscreen for &lt;$50, but I suspect that would make running the UI in a browser tricky, but worse, I can't seen to find a combo that would be cheaper than $80 for the tablet. If under &lt;$30 would be willing to relax many of these constraints!

g82xoy,1587854457,Controlling outdoor lights,"My outdoor porch light and street lamp are controlled by wifi switches and I have some outdoor low voltage lights plugged into a (built in) wifi outlet.  The switches and plugs are both TPLink.  I chose TPLink because it seems reasonably stable but mostly because it's been reverse engineered and is programmable outside of the Kasa app (and Google Home / Alexa ecosystem).

I like this setup b/c it allows me to have python code running on my computer that knows the sunrise/sunset times based on my location and can turn on/off these lights around dusk/dawn.

I wanted to share with you an improvement I recently made to this setup.  I also have three wifi cameras around: one on the driveway, on on the front doorstep and one in the back by my shed.  The other day it got really gloomy here before a rainstorm -- dark enough that I thought ""I wish the outside lights would cut on"".  I was thinking about trying to rig up an ""electric eye"" with a raspberry pi or something but then I realized I already essentially have three eyes: the cameras.

So I wrote literally 36 lines of python code that scrapes a jpeg image from each camera and computes the average pixel value of the whole thing.  Essentially, all black on all cameras would give me a 0 and all white on all cameras would be 255.  I do this once every 5 minutes and now can use ""outside gloomyness"" as another factor to turn on the lights (in the middle of the day if needed).  Happy to share code if you're interested (PM).

The point of this post is to give you ideas but also to spread my strong belief that people in the home automation community (us!) should insist that the devices we buy are not locked into any one manufacturer's ""walled garden"".  I will not buy a product I can't interact with via code I write and I hope that if enough of us feel the same way then home automation will move in a more open direction in the long term.  &lt;/soapbox&gt;",yoshiatsu,/r/homeautomation/comments/g82xoy/controlling_outdoor_lights/,6,homeautomation,6

Bought a new (to me) home [pretty old], 5300 sqft on 1/3rd acre with three floors. Home is bathed in wifi. Getting everything connected would be nice - I have a few problems I want to fix now and I might as well start with compatible systems.

- Looking at Lutron Casetas for a few rooms with power switches in hard places to take advantage of the Nano Remotes

- I've got a bunch of ceiling fans without the fan wire; and they have old remote controls that are not wall plates. I'd like to replace those, probably with some sort of controller (zwave?) at the fan base that controls light and power, then put a smart switch on the wall to control both.

- Half of us are iOS people, so we'll use HomeBridge. 

- A few Phillips Hues scattered around the house mostly for mood. Too many bulbs to make them the primary lights. Already got a hub for that.

- Two August Pros that can work on Zwave. I don't care too much about having those remote though.

- An Ecobee 3, which works fine with Homekit for now

- Rachio 3s in the backyard, work fine via the app

- a smart garage door opener, but not sure what yet

- It'd be nice to have an outdoor lock for the front gate with a pin pad and auto relock. Not sure if there's a Zwave version of this.

I'm just guessing on ZWave vs Zigbee, still a novice with those. I know the Casetas come very well recommended for the inside of the house... although I only need a few of those, so if there isn't a caseta zwave bridge, I suppose I could find a zwave equivalent.

Also, what sort of zwave hub software do I want to start with? Or something zwave+zigbee?

g83qu4,1587857484,Blink XT2 v Eufy CE - Please Help Me Choose!,"Hey All! I'm in the market for some wireless security cameras. We live on a corner lot off a main road that runs through our development. Lots of people walk and drive past our house all day and night. I have a rickety old 4ft fence that isn't holding up well, a dog that likes to dig under it lol and a son that likes to play in the side yard that we have no visibility to from inside the house. Currently we have and older SimpliSafe security system, no cameras. We only have 1 wyze camera in the house, fire tv, a google home mini and 2 echo dots (can't settle on personal assistants either lol).

I'm struggling to make a decision mainly over the following points...

* Blink has replaceable batteries that can't be recharged, however the device should, in theory last much longer. Eufy in theory will only last 4-5 years with ""average"" use, once that battery goes, its time to buy a new device. However with how fast technology changes, would I be buying a new device by then anyway?
* Eufy video quality itself seems much better. I'm always a sucker for getting the ""better quality"" device but is it really that critical?
* Eufy field of view is WAY better 135 vs 110. I feel this is a fairly big deal when it comes to security cameras.
* Blink is considerably cheaper (however there are some deals right now for Eufy 2 cam kits)
* Blink now offers an indoor mini cam at a reasonable price ($35). Its nice to have all your cameras. Would be nice to replace my Wyze cams with these and have all my cameras on the same app. Eufy currently has no comparable device.
* Eufy offers many more devices and options. In the future I may want a doorbell cam, I'd be very annoyed if I had one app for security cams and another for doorbell cam.

How am I to decide! Please help! What are everyone’s thoughts. I'm especially interested in folks who may have tried both.",riegersn,/r/homeautomation/comments/g83qu4/blink_xt2_v_eufy_ce_please_help_me_choose/,2,homeautomation,4

As you can  see,  we had just finished soldering the LED strips as depicted.  Let me say however, that I ran out of soldering tips and towards the end it became a poor job, so i will have to correct some of it tomorrow.

Questions:

1.When I plug them in, they all light up white, and most colors work, but when i go to green or yellow only the first stripset for the first shelf lights up (the one attached directly to controller) and the rest do not light up.  My logic tells me since I did not do a great job on some of them and one of the green cables are loose?

2.The other issue is they get hot QUICK. Uncomfortably hot. Upon some research this seems to be ""normal"" but some LED strips were hotter than others? what would cause this? once I correct the soldering will it be more even?

3,As you can see the cabinet is an IKEA cabinet.  I was originally intending to use the included 3M glue on the strips and put them directly on the shelf, but considering how hot they get it seems the aluminum channel diffusers are not optional after all.  What are your thoughts?

4. The LED controller makes a high pitch whirring noise sometimes.  Normal?

Any other advice? Just want to make sure this works and I do not burn my house down lol

We have 71 downlights. I'd love to have RGB downlights for all, but open to options. 

Ideally, I'm trying to accomplish the following:

1. Have rooms setup that can be switched on/off via a normal wall switch, be app-controlled and also be Alexa controlled.
2. I want to be able to set schedules for rooms and light settings (like warmer lighting at night etc) or switch the porch light on from 6pm to 12pm daily.
3. Would love to tie in to some in ceiling speaker system as well (Being able to use Alexa to play music in the alfresco, then use Alexa to combine the lighting to be a party :) )
4. Strip lighting under some cabinets.
5. We plan to also get a video doorbell and LCD display, was looking at HikVision but mentioning in case their are options that combine,
6. Motion detection for some lights. Ideally, things like walk in robes and also would love ones in the powder room so if the kids go to the toilet at night it'll come on, but very dim.
7. A few people raised concerns of 71+ downlights on the wifi. How do you solve this?

So based on the above, what would you do? What platform would you recommend? Lights?

g8gvqg,1587917100,SmartThings appears to be down again for the second time in three days......HomeAssistant?,"So two days ago ST had an outage and half my sensors stopped reporting and my automations failed. I spent an hour trying to fix my stuff before I found out it wasn’t “my stuff” that was the problem. This morning the exact same things is occurring but ST isn’t reporting an outage yet. 

I’ve been avoiding HA like the plague because I feel like I already have my hands full trying to learn about Z-Wave and Zigbee and working out automation logic to create good rules and find effective solutions to various scenarios but I’ve got to be honest........the lack of local control is already getting under my skin. 

With two outages in three days, even though HA’s learning curve appears to be nasty, ST is on my shit list. I don’t want to learn HA because it’s really intimidating but I’m afraid my inner geek won’t allow me to stick with ST for much longer. When I set something up and it works I expect it to just work but because of the cloud that’s never going to be a guarantee so the only option I have is to jump ass deep into something I don’t want to do in order to get full and complete local control as soon as possible. 

I’ve joined the HA subreddit and I’m shopping for a Pi4 now but I was hoping the hive mind could show me some good beginner guides for getting started on this journey.

g8hog3,1587919721,Meeting indicator light?,"Hello there!

My husband sometimes closes the door to his office during the day, oftentimes because it is loud on the other side of the house, but sometimes because he is in a video call. I have accidentally walked into his video calls several times, and I really wish I knew when he was in one without opening the door. Often times these meetings just pop-up, so sharing a calendar doesn’t always work, and he can get really into his work and forget to message beforehand.

What I ideally would like to do is have a light or lit sign outside of his door that changes color or lights up when he is in a meeting. 

I was thinking this could either happen with he uses his webcam or when he opens his web conferencing software. I’m not sure if I would need a microcontroller like Arduino or if the solution is just software on his computer. We use Bluetooth-enabled Hue lights, but I’m already looking into getting a Hue Bridge, so that’s probably how we will manage the lights.

He uses a Windows 10 computer, his work uses Zoom for video conferencing, and his webcam is a Logitech C920. In his office, he has a Google Wifi node in here that is not the main node, but hardwiring into the internet wouldn't be very difficult if necessary.

\[I know that we could probably install some sort of button that he could press to change a light, but 1) I worry that he would forget, and 2) I think this could be a cool project .\]

Just looking for a two or three simple smart bulbs for my small little house.

I have a Hive hub already, which is used with our Hive heating system, so it would make sense to get Hive bulbs which would work with that hub.

That said, I already have a TP-Link Kasa smart bulb and their app looks nice, and again doesn't need a hub. Bulbs are about £18 each, slightly cheaper than the Hive ones. 

However, I've seen a brand on Amazon called LE (Lighting Ever) and I can get two of their white smart bulbs for £20. Seems like a good deal, and doesn't need a hub. I already have a TCP Smart Light bulb and the app for that is pretty poor, it works but it's not intuitive and looks messy, anyone know if the LE app is just a relabeled version? From screenshots I've seen it looks so...

Lastly, if I go with standalone wifi bulbs without a hub, does that inadvertently affect WiFi speed? Or would you need a ton of bulbs for that to happen?

Directly behind that switch is another that’s part of a three way circuit for the light on our stairs. (Another switch for the stair light is that the top of the stairs.) Originally we tried to piggyback of the neutral for the stair light, but that caused all three switches (dinning room, and the three way circuit for the stairs) to control both lights. Then we though, maybe we’d use the neutral going to the switch at the bottom of the stairs for the dinning room light, and then install another DW6HD in the switch at the top of the stairs and make it a normal switch (not a three way circuit with the one at the bottom of the stairs), essentially getting rid of the switch at the foot of the stairs.

However, I'm wondering if there's any open source software that takes the remote/controller out of the equation, and rather provides that functionality through a nice web UI? 

I'm sure this would require additional hacking, such as getting a microcontroller to send the data values to the LED strip, and getting the data from the web app to the microcontroller as well, but that part is out of the scope of this post.

g8n2qw,1587937148,New build - What the most modern way to build a new home audio system that gives you the most flexibilty?,"I have been planning an upgrade to my house to have multizone audio.
The typical system I see people using is a russound or similar system that has multiple inputs and multiple outputs.

The issue with that, is that lets say I want to be able to listen to spotify on three different rooms and each one should be a different Spotify station, I would need to have three separate devices that can play Spotify hooked up to 3 separate inputs.

There are some players that have built-in clients that can play Spotify directly, like the Nuvo Player series. But I don't think the Nuvo has a method of integration.

So what would be the best most modern way to be able to design a multi-zone (lets say 6 zone) home audio system? Is there a 6 zone amplifier that can do this off the bat that supports an API? Or is it better to get 6 audrino type devices and have them hooked up to a single zone dumb amplifier? But then you have the issue of controlling audio, and then you would need to be controlling two separate devices for each zone. And how are you going to handle lets say a non-digital audio source, like a microphone jack?

Any suggestions?

My interest in home automation has always been practical. The whole ""LOL I can make my lights green!"" impress-your-friends factor doesn't do much for me, mainly because I don't have friends. So without further ado…

#Platform
I run basically everything through [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and love it. I originally started off with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) but had no end of bugs and troubles.

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/uer8B7K.png) a current photo of my dashboard.

#Security
I have three $30-$50USD security cameras managed through [Blue Iris](https://blueirissoftware.com/) ($70 for the full version).

I send HTTP requests from Node-RED to command Blue Iris to enable/disable motion detection and control PTZ.

When my cameras detect motion, the following happens ([image of the flow for those interested](https://i.imgur.com/6OipR7X.png)):

1. Blue Iris saves a still image to C:\BlueIris\Alerts. I use a ""Watch"" node to listen for additions to this folder.
2. A ""File in"" node grabs the image and sends it to [Google's Vision API](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-google-vision-object-detection) (free for 1000 requests per month).
3. The API fires back with a list of objects it has recognised, along with confidence ratings.
4. If the list of recognised objects includes ""Person"" or ""Van"" (for the courier), I send an [alert](https://i.imgur.com/AtyFHN2.png) to my Phone using [PushOver](https://pushover.net/) ([link to the node](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-pushover)).
5. If not, a reset camera command is sent to Blue Iris via HTTP request.

I've experimented with [Google's Video Recognition](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-google-video-object-detection), but I've found the response time too long to be practically useful.

On my dashboard I have 10 second apart screenshots from each of my cameras. I do this by setting Blue Iris to capture images every 10 seconds, and have Node-RED grab and display them as they appear. Nothing complex.

#Network
My home network is controlled by [Ubiquiti's Unifi controller software](https://www.ui.com/software/). I use [this flow](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-unifi) to make it talk to Node-RED and give me various stats.

#Commands
I have a [centralised relay flow](https://i.imgur.com/RxNyldr.png) for issuing commands to my system.

The inputs include:

- Typed into the Node-RED dashboard (which I always have open on a second monitor).
- Spoken to my computer. I use a keyboard shortcut to run a script which uses [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to record audio for 5 seconds. This is then passed to [Google's Speech to Text API](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-google-cloud), which passes the text result to my relay.
- Using [Siri Shortcuts](https://i.imgur.com/vjqc1Or.png) I can speak a command to my phone and send the result to my relay via HTTP request. I also use Siri Shortcuts for simple toggles, such as [this one for my heater](https://i.imgur.com/f3Dol8N.png).

The relay listens for specific keywords to figure out which flow is needed. For example, if the payload includes ""garage door"", the message is passed to my garage door flow. That flow will then look for the words ""open"" and ""closed"" to figure out what to do (it also check's the status of the garage door). If the word ""is"" is found, it will simply report back the status.

Here's a few examples:

- ""Turn the coffee machine on""

- ""Open the garage door""

- ""Is the heater on?""

- ""Turn the hallway light to 100%""

For specifically controlling my PC:

- ""Open Reddit""

- ""Search YouTube for cat videos""

- ""Bring up the news""

All the commands are quite flexible, for example I could say ""Turn on the coffee machine"", ""Turn coffee on"", or just ""coffee on"".

I have also written in support for constitutive commands, such as ""close the garage door and turn my coffee machine on""


#System
I use [psMQTT](https://github.com/eschava/psmqtt) to feed CPU and Disk usage stats to my dashboard.

I use [nircmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) to make buttons that select between my computers speakers and my headphones, and also have a button to simply lock my computer.

#Device control
One word. TASMOTA. All devices in the list below are flashed with Tasmota using [TuyaConvert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert), and are controlled locally via MQTT.

- A [$20USD garage door controller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32987501714.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.6cbdfd161x6dzr&amp;algo_pvid=2741f0b0-aea4-46f8-a1df-19ef18e5fd61&amp;algo_expid=2741f0b0-aea4-46f8-a1df-19ef18e5fd61-1&amp;btsid=0ab6d67915879686645584342e100d&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_) which took all of [20 minutes to install](https://i.imgur.com/hS6qMSW.jpg). [Here's](https://i.imgur.com/ksqhckn.png) the flow I use to control it.

- Two [$11USD smart bulbs](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33051979731.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dXhVq80). One I use in my workroom, the other is in our [hallway lamp](https://i.imgur.com/eR8H8FJ.jpg) and changes colour depending on the weather forecast.

- Two [$10USD switches](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000058584706.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4d5GkgoL). One to [control my coffee machine](https://i.imgur.com/Q7qSZiN.jpg), the other to [control my heater](https://i.imgur.com/HwDRZXN.jpg) (no online link to this one as I bought it locally).

- An [$11USD motion sensor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000013113894.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.3d7011b66GA6Mm&amp;algo_pvid=6a2c8d62-d604-44dd-a3b2-32bd84912d5a&amp;algo_expid=6a2c8d62-d604-44dd-a3b2-32bd84912d5a-0&amp;btsid=0be3746c15879691117974878e70c1&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_) (took some basic soldering to force it to power on long enough to flash, not difficult). I use this in my hallway as a bugler alarm when we're not home.

#Location map
I use [OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org/) to publish mine and my wife's locations to Node-RED, which are then fed to the [map UI](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap) on my dashboard. An ETA home is generated by passing the co-ordinates to the [Google Maps API](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-google). [Here's](https://i.imgur.com/2uUddnm.png) a picture of the flow I use.

#Forecast
I use the [DarkSky API](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-darksky) to get weather forecast information. On my dashboard I show descriptions of the next 4 days, as well as temperature, cloud coverage, and chance of rain graphs (toggled between via buttons).

#Media
I use [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) to download TV shows and pass them to my [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/). Whenever Sonarr does this I have it notify me by sending an HTTP request to Node-RED, which then sends the message ""Downloading a new episode of [TV Show]"" to my phone using Pushover.

#Protocols
Here's a few little fun and useful automations I use:

- The command ""Indiana Jones"" disables motion detection for 2 minutes, opens my garage door, then closes it after 40 seconds. I use this all the time since our garage door is the best entrance/exit to our home.

- The command  ""Leaving Home"" disables motion detection for 3 minutes, opens my garage door, informs me of the next event on my calendar, and tells me the days weather.

- The command  ""Arriving Home"" does basically the same with a few tweaks.

- The command ""Status report"" reads out the status of all my devices.

#What's next?
- We're planning to move into a new home in the next year, in which I plan to have smart lighting throughout. I have my eyes on the Gosund dimmer switches, which look like they can be flashed with Tasmota (A MUST).

- Robot vacuum cleaner! Currently have my eyes on the Roborock S5 Max, which looks like it'll talk quite nicely to my Node-RED setup.

- Automatic blind/curtain drivers. Every one I've seen so far looks way overpriced to me, so I'll probably end up trying to build one. Wish me luck!",LeptonGames,/r/homeautomation/comments/g8x7dh/sharing_my_home_automation_adventure_so_far/,8,homeautomation,2

Haven't found a single mention here about them. 

The other controller I'm looking at is [Gledopto](https://www.amazon.de/-/cs/dp/B077GB2QHD/ref=twister_B07Z6NJ78N?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;coliid=I3L4US88BC67V2&amp;colid=1HBJRN4HAPTGP), which seems fine too. 

What I need is a way to control 8x2m strips (placed on horizontal beams in the attic), split into 2 sections (so that I can turn half of the room off). Seems like LED controller can reliably do 5m, so I think I will either need 4 Gledopto or 2 Ilumize (since they can control 2 stripes). And there is no cost difference since it's either 4x€30 for Gledopto or 2x€60 for Ilumize.

Most everything is works except a key feature in the Schlage FE599 door lock - it's ability to add and remove lock codes.

The lock has the ability to store up to 19 4-digit codes. The process was fairly simple under Vera, but I can't figure it out in HomeSeer. On the attached image there are two drop down menus for the codes. The first shows letters (19 capital letters and the rest are lower case). The second pull down menu shows ""1-999"".

After setting various letter and number values in the software, I can't figure out what they translate to as 4-digit lock codes. Also, I don't even know if this is the place where these lock codes get set.

Anyone have any experience or insight with this? Thanks!

(specials for redditors here),"Before, Aqara was criticized for launching of international versions of its products too slowly. The company knows about it and works on it. As a result, in 2020 Aqara has prepared a bunch of product launches for American and European markets, and the first of them will be today's American launch of the new Zigbee 3.0 Wall Switches along with the already known Cube Controller!

So. today the following products were launched on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Aqara):

**1) Aqara Wall Switch**, which supports the recent Zigbee 3.0 protocol, is compliant with North American switch standards and will have 4 versions:

* No Neutral, Single Rocker
* No Neutral, Double Rocker
* With Neutral, Single Rocker
* With Neutral, Double Rocker

2) Aqara Cube Controller, a unique compact device capable of controlling any of supported smart home devices using 6 actions.

Moreover, to support Reddit community members, we prepared special promo codes. Hurry up, coupons will expire after several days. To use it, just use the following code when checking out to get the discount of 20%: **AQAREDDT**.

Please upvote to make more people see the post and the code!

To address the concerns of [r/homeautomation](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/) members: Aqara Zigbee 3.0 products use pretty standard Zigbee profiles, which means you finally can connect them to third-party hubs such as Amazon Echo Plus without any hassle (better use the single rocker version)!

I am re-doing my bedroom, and I have both of the lamps (ikea lamps with specialized bulbs-Non removable) hooked to the walls on either side of the bed. Currently they both have the wires going down and converging together behind the bed, where they plug into an outlet that is turned on and off via a stick-up switch by the door.   


Since we are redoing the room, I want to do that more.. officially. Putting the cords behind the shiplap we intend to put up, and trying to overall build them more into the wall.   


I would like a more concrete solution for the on/off switch and device as the one I have in there is cheap, and I would like to bring smart home and automation (alexa) into it as well.   


What products would help me do that best? I am really looking for a smart plug and a smart switch that both connect to alexa. The switch cannot be wired, as it is stuck to a spot about 8 feet away from the lightswitch that runs the overhead fan (plus getting to the outlet would be hard as it is on the other side of the room. 

I also can't use smart bulbs like a phillips Hue (I have those already in my home in a different place with one of their switches) because of the light bulb thing I mentioned already. 

Ideally, a phillips Hue switch combined with a plug would be optimal.

It's very easy and quick to add **Google Assistant** /**Google Home** integration to NodeRED thanks to NORA.  In case you not aware, NORA creates virtual devices that you can link to your NodeRED connected gadgets and control via Google Home app and voice commands.

\- Alexa integration requires a ton of things (securely connect HA to internet, routing, TLS, LetsEncrypt, etc) and doesn't seem like an easy task. Where to start on this?

\- Philips Hue lights are not recognized. They're integrated with Google Home, Why not visible to HA?

\- I had Summit&amp;Fox lights and plugs which are not even in the list of integrations. This is a can of worms, see below...

\- Nest thermostat integration doesn't seem to be straight-forward, need dev account, etc...

I'm afraid all this setup is going to be a time sink (even in corona lockdown) and going thru rabbit holes. I was hoping for an easier integration path and onboard devices quickly. I'm frustrated. What do you recommend for starting integrations? I'm not very motivated to spend hours and hours on this...

Note: Fox&amp;Summit devices which are still on sale on Fry's and Amazon, don't work at all!. The vendor shut shop,  website is down (for at least a week) and iPhone app is not functioning.

I tried this last night and it worked and actually made the light brighter which I don't know if that's a good thing. So I'm wondering if this is a safe practice, and if it is, can I run all the lights in a given section off of one smart plug with a power board and extension cables.

So far so good, as the fan is super-strong, quiet (nearly silent) and can move a lot of air with minimal effort. The issue comes from the app (pairing) and installation instructions.

Once the app is installed you are presented with a typical wifi pairing screen (if you've ever paired a Wemo or other wi-fi controlled device, then you know the procedure). There seems to be an issue with connecting from your device to the fan, but I cannot find a consistant answer to the problem. 

Some reviews say, press the yellow light button, others say the white (this includes the instruction manual), either way, no love. So I'm wondering how others got it connected and running. I'm so close, yet so far away.

Is there a way to automate this? 

I've thought of two approaches:

1. Install ambient light sensors in the room, and then set up the programming so if the light level is greater than some value, don't turn on the light. 
2. Hook in to some weather program and if it is between certain times of day and it's not cloudy, then don't turn the light on.

g9it18,1588059432,How do I catch a thief in the house with cameras?,"While typing this, I wondered if my problem even needs context, but here it is if it is necessary. 

Skip to end for the question.

I live in a house with 2 floors and my cousin's family lives on the floor above mine. Recently, there's been a case of garbage being found in my family's washing machine and we suspect it is my cousin's parents because they've done shady stuff in the past and even now (I am close with my cousins and this situation is just stressful for us because our parents have been constantly arguing for about a year).

So to catch the person dumping garbage into our washing machine, we install a Yi-Home camera in the laundry room. Probably about 2 days later that camera sees pitch black and we can only make out traces of objects it sees. The garbage situation continues and a while later we install another yi-home camera we bought. That camera then gets stolen with prime suspects being my cousin's parents who just came home after the camera was just recently installed and with my 90-year-old grandpa as an eyewitness who says he saw them in the act. Since we never really have solid proof that they are the culprits, the end result is always a big argument with me and my cousins having to choose our parents' side.

My problem is how can I have my camera catch the culprit in the act and still have the recording if it gets stolen? I am planning on buying a Wyze cam to hide and record another angle in case the other camera gets stolen again.

I've been following this sub for awhile now and have been awed by what I've seen, so thought I'd take a chance and reach out here to see if anyone wants to help me plan my ideal setup. Without further ado.

Wants: 

\-Use Case: Alexa/Google enabled routines (eg. ""Good night"" would turn downstairs lights off, dim stairway lights to 25%, activate Ring ""home"" mode, adjust the Nest thermostats)

\-A smart home hub, that is at least a 27x16 flat screen in the kitchen.  We have a breaker box access panel that would make a great spot, and needs to be covered with something.  I want to display family Google calendars, weather, pictures, browser/app controlled by Alexa/Google (eg Tell Alexa to play videos on YT) ,  ability to pull up Ring security camera streams, all in a visually pleasing, easy to manipulate solution.  Calendars, weather, and photos are my priorities.

Currently, I have...

\-A gate entry system with LTS connect. 

\-Home security and exterior cameras via Ring.

\-Several Lutron switches from a previous home

\-A Phillip Hue hub with interior and exterior lights

\-Eero wireless, stretching across the entire property

Even now, the old setup doesn't work and a single dimmer refuses to work in the box. Did I fry my neutral somehow? There's only one gang of loads (hot, neutral, and ground) entering the box but obviously two lines leading to the separate lights, should each of the dimmer's grounds and neutrals be totally separate?

* **Price:** I would prefer to not go over $500, but obviously anything cheaper (while still being reliable) is preferred.

* Needs to be good with dealing with pet hair, as I said before.

* **Brand:** This doesn't matter to me. During my research, I've read problems with every brand (Roomba isn't that intelligent, Neato's have trouble getting back to the dock, etc.) so I'm going off your personal experiences.

* I would like one with an app that allows me to see which rooms have been cleaned, have a map of the apartment, etc. I don't care about Alexa or Google Voice connectivity as I don't use either.

* I'm a big fix-it myself guy so a vacuum that allows for easy repairs for 5 to 10 years would be great.

* I'm pretty OCD when it comes to cleaning so I want an intelligent vacuum; one that moves in straight lines and knows when it has missed spots, not just randomly cleaning a room.

I'm trying to figure out a way that when I turn on my bathroom light with a switch - the bulb can be cool white in the mornings but after 10pm, be soft white and dim - a ""pee light"" if you will. I need the physical switch integration for the wife, otherwise I'd just do voice commands.

I'm sure I'm overthinking this, but if the light is powered off, then the smart bulb is getting no information that it is whatever time of day, so it won't know to change color temp and brightness when powered on - so do I need to do some combination of smart switch and smart bulb?

gadjz1,1588181128,Smart Light Fail,"So I woke up at 4:40am this morning because my bedroom light was on. Then I realize my entire house is on. WTF. I try to ask Alexa to turn off all the lights but she didn't respond. As I am walking around my house I see my living room lamp flashing on and off rapidly. My first thought, ""Oh shit, we've been hacked"". 

The majority of my house has Hue lights, but the bulbs in that lamp were a gift from my sister and are some wifi bulbs. That's when I realized my internet was down, then I concluded that due to the major storm that was happening outside that the power had gone out and upon restore all the lights in the house turned on. Since my modem and router were still starting up I had no wifi. I guess wifi bulbs flash when wifi is down. I pulled the plug on the lamp then I had to go room to room turning off the hue lights from the switch (yay z-wave switches).

I finally get all the lights off, and tuck myself into bed. Less than 10 minutes later power goes out, then a few minutes later my entire house lights are back on. And thus started my second round of shutting off the lights. Get done with that task, lie down and the power went out again. My power managed to stay out till about an hour ago. 

So moral of the story don't assume that ""Power Loss Recovery"" setting is on.",wabbit983,/r/smarthome/comments/gadjz1/smart_light_fail/,1,smarthome,0

You can integrate your Sonoff smart plugs into Home Assistant (and thus node-red) without flashing firmware etc.

No cloud needed - you can disconnect your internet. Super fast, they turn off/on before your finger or mouse has left the button.

Much easier than flashing firmware, for my case anyway. Didn't even need to physically touch the devices, great if they are somewhere remote or hard to access.

[Reminder, To secure your CCTV cameras and any IoT Devices from the internet otherwise anyone can view them. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/g497zb/reminder_to_secure_your_cctv_cameras_and_any_iot/)

You really need to invest some time reading about how to secure these kinds of devices, I suspect a lot of you already do. It's not that difficult to be honest as most are ""insecure by default"" which is the big issues. 

In a series of posts I am looking at what is out there on the internet using the Rapid 7 Open Source datasets. 

[Open Data Sets](https://opendata.rapid7.com/)

Some of it is low hanging fruit like the Roku devices or the cameras etc and in this series I am picking on Sonos because I happen to love the Sonos brand. So alas...I picked the UK but there are a lot more, Again I do not have the compute power to go through all the datasets, The largest sets are a few gig and that takes a lot of memory to churn through.

So Sonos, **Might I add this is NOT a bug with Sonos** this is incorrectly or misconfigured devices.

It would not take someone like me long at all to write a computer program to hijack these devices on mass around the world and change settings using the SoCo Python Library, play whatever music or sounds I want which would be inconvenient at best and creepy and scary at worst depending on the situation.

https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo

So anyway check your IP against this list, Ask people who have Sonos players too. 

[Open Sonos list - Sample](https://github.com/tg12/rapid7_OSINT/blob/master/scans/sonos_whois.txt)

There are more out there this is just looking for the UK stuff in the smaller datasets. Please feel free to take a look at my code and use it if you want to spend time with the larger datasets.

2) be able to open the garage via a panel outside the garage (currently exists and has been useful. I know we could use phones remotely, but in case we are busy..

My father has recently purchased a house that has an out dated home automation system and wireless network.  

We plan on having a company come out to upgrade to a new system, that being said they are busy and won’t be able to come for about a month. 

One of the thing we need to fix in the mean time is the internet.  

People are living here and since schools are closed my sister needs to take online classes.  

So I have these 4 old Ubiquiti Access Points and the need to update their firmware for them to work properly with the new controller I had to set up.  

I’ve physically reset all of the access points. 

Now that It wants me to adopt and update the APs in the controller. 

Every time I do this it just says updating and never goes anywhere.  

I’ve tried to custom upgrade from the maintenance menu and that hasn’t done anything. 

It says “Connected (Update Required) by each AP. 

I all so tried to SSH to the devices to push the upgrade and I couldn’t get that to work either.  (I’m not very experienced in using a terminal)

Does anyone have any advice or has anyone found a solution?

I’d very much appreciate it 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",Audionerd420,/r/homeautomation/comments/gavgvj/requesting_help_with_an_old_ass_n_band_ubiquiti/,1,homeautomation,0
gavuis,1588253983,Help with smart home lighting setup (Z-wave + Home Assistant + IKEA Trådfri),"Hey guys, 

I am planning to get a setup for smart lighting in my apartment and would love to hear what you think about it. I'd like for this setup to be cost efficient and simple, but reliable. I have been reading up and come up with the setup below but would love some feedback before ordering everything. 

I currently have a Raspberry Pi 4 at home, functioning as a Pi-hole, and I am therefore considering getting a Z-wave UZB and use Home Assistant for controlling my devices. 

In order to remotely power the ceiling lights on and off, I'll connect Fibaro Switches to the wall switches in all rooms, Single or Double depending on the current switch. This way, I imagine I can always make sure that if I turn on the light remotely in a room, there's no risk that the wall switch is off and nothing will happen. 

In order to make the ceiling lamps dimmable, now controlled with with Fibaro switches, I'll plug in IKEAs Trådfri bulbs, and thereby get dimming functionality. Additionally, I'll have these IKEA-bulbs in other lamps around the house, which I imagine can be paired in different ways and controlled together with the ceiling lights. 

&amp;#x200B;

The things that I'll need with this setup:

* Z-wave UZB controller
* Fibaro Switches Single/Double
* IKEA Trådfri gateway and bulbs

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions:

* Seeing as I'm not using the Fibaro Dimmers, will it be possible to use the Fibaro Switch with IKEA Trådfri? Or are there compatability issues?
* Will I be able to separately control two different light sources with the Fibaro Double Switch?
* All my rooms have ""classic"" toggle light switches, do I need to change these into push button switches?
* Will I be able to set up and control my whole setup with HomeKit if needed? 
* The items listed above, are they good enough for the setup? Please let me know if there are other options!

&amp;#x200B;

gazl82,1588266074,Smart humidity sensor + humidifier recommendation?,"I want to get a humidifier for my new house plant. Ideally I would like the humidifier to shut on/off when the the humidity in the air reaches a certain threshold. 

Right now I have **zero** smart home devices in my apartment. No hub, no smart bulbs, nada.

* a smart plug
* a dumb humidifier

gb0qz4,1588269648,Are there any bluetooth controlled robot vacuums?,"I recently bought Xiaomi Roborock S50 for my aunt. I'm very happy with how it performs. The only downside that I noticed is that I need to have Wifi to be able to control it remotely. My aunt is not very tech savvy and only has phone and tablet with celular data. Thus, there is no way for her to manage it via an app. She's mostly fine with it as she can turn it on with button press, but it would be nice to have an option to control vacuum directly by connecting to it via Bluetooth or other similar method, that does not require having additional devices that act as a middleman. I know that this model does not offer such feature, even with custom software such as [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo) or [dustcloud](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud).

gb0t06,1588269816,Anybody work with water pressure sensors?,"I’m pretty sure that a water pressure sensor is what I need, but wading through the differences and specs is a bit foreign to me. 

I have a wet bar with a glass washer. Glass washers are notoriously finicky about shutting off and can sometimes come on when you don’t want them to. Mine is currently set up so that the valve is only open when the bar light (z-wave) is switched on. Problem is, most valves are not meant to be energized for hours and hours at a time. Specs say not to go more than 8 hours without adding a cooling fan. Adding the fan is an option, but I thought that adding a controller that senses when the glass filler and washer are demanding water and then send a signal to switch the valve open (basically the opposite function of an automatic leak detection valve) would be a more elegant solution.

...Enter water pressure sensor... 

I am completely comfortable with plumbing and electrical work so difficulty of implementation is not an issue. And, like everyone else, I find myself with plenty of free time, so any suggestions or experience you can throw my way would be appreciated.
