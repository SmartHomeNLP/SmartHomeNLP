cy334i,1567296582,Low voltage causes Lutron switches to have problems,"In my kitchen I have a Lutron Caseta switch.  There's no neutral so it relies on power passing through the bulb even when they're ""off"".

The two original CFLs I had in there weren't enough, so I replaced them with dimmable LEDs.  And everything was good.

5 months later, I've noticed that the bulbs don't turn off and sometimes the Lutron switch flashes red.  The landing at the top of my stairs also has 2 of these bulbs and does the same thing.  But the hallway with 3 bulbs works fine.

Checking the power voltage reported by my UPS, I see it frequently drops to 119 or 118V.  I'm guessing this is pure load caused by all the aircons in the neighbourhood; I'm used to seeing 123 or 124V

So I guess that two dimmable LED bulbs is _marginal_ for allowing the caseta switch to remained powered.  I should probably add the MLC, which I wanted to avoid by using the dimmable LEDs :-(",sweharris,/r/smarthome/comments/cy334i/low_voltage_causes_lutron_switches_to_have/,10,smarthome,11

cy4qyi,1567306320,Newbie questions...what hardware to start with for future home automation???,"Looking for guidance on hardware for installation on install happening now, for home automation I'll probably start after the first of the year.  The caveat is most data needs to be local - with ***no*** internet connection required, no Alexa, Google Home, etc. I'd like to keep the data as private as possible.  I presume I need to know what controller I will use to guide the hardware selection.  I'm going with Zwave switches and need advice on the type of LED strips...

Is my research on options for controllers that don't need internet correct?- Hubitat = off the shelf hardware &amp; software controller for Zwave + devices- Raspberry Pi + Home Assistant with some add ons (I have no idea what Hassio or NodeRed are but see them mentioned together often) = a solution I have to build, but that also uses Zwave and can concurrently use Zigbee- Raspberry Pi + OpenHAB = a solution I have to build, but that also uses Zwave- Any others, especially off the shelf ones?Pros / Cons of above?

Below is what I would like the setup to eventually do- I've highlighted the hardware I need to buy now.

a. Alarm system - monitored, so  internet connection required for that and might not need to be connected to the smarthome devicesb. Security cameras that record locally and also let me view remotely on motion alerts - maybe view through my personal Google drive or photos - or direct to a DVR?c.

One of the first things I will be doing, as I did with my existing house, is to wire the whole house up with in wall ethernet ports.

cyfl2l,1567372059,Looking for a GFCI that can send push notification for when it trips,"Sorry if this is a simple fix, but I'm new to this.  

**Problem:**  I have a second fridge in my garage that holds drinks and in the freezer, ice cream and all our meat.  Occasionally the GFCI will trip and the fridge/freezer will be shut off.  This can happen for a couple days before I notice and then when I open the freezer it find that all our meat is defrosted for who knows how long.  

Is there a product or solution that would enable me to get a push notification, text message, or app alert for when my fridge stops getting power?  I'm getting tired of throwing meat and ice cream out because I don't check the fridge every day.

Edit:
Thanks for all the feedback and suggestions (y’all are getting upvotes from me).  From what I’ve gathered, fridges are not supposed to be on GFCI duplexes, however I believe it’s code that a garage outlet has to be GFCI (being a potential wet area).  So my first course of action will be to replace the GFCI with a new one. If that doesn’t solve it then I’ll go with the temperature sensors, something like the wirelesstag.net sensors mentioned.  If I want to get really involved I’ll go the programming route with the MQTT push notifications.

Edit II:
It seems that theres an exception in the NEC 2015 (National Electrical Code) that allows for plugs at fridges to be non-GFCI, See code below:

` The requirement for GFCI receptacles in garages and sheds, as illustrated in Exhibit 210.10, improves safety for persons using portable hand-held tools, gardening appliances, lawn mowers, string trimmers, snow blowers, and so on, that might be connected to these receptacles, which are often the closest ones available. GFCI protection is also required in garage areas where auto repair work and general workshop electrical tools are used. Exception No. 1 to 210.8(A)(2) permits a ceiling-mounted receptacle that is installed for connection of a garage door opener to be exempt from the GFCI requirement. Exception No. 2 to 210.8(A)(2) allows a duplex receptacle located where two cord-and-plug-connected appliances occupy a dedicated space to be exempt from the GFCI requirement. If only a single cord-and-plug-connected appliance, such as a food 
freezer, occupies the dedicated space, then a single receptacle must be used.'

This is a long way of saying that I may be able to remove the GFCI in favor of a regular duplex.  I'm going to consult an electrician just to make sure.

Edit III:
Just talked with an in-house expert architect was recommended that I put the fridge on a regular duplex but put the duplex on its onw separate circuit that is GFCI protected.

I've analyzed the packets and most of them are `Zigbee Network Layer Command` packets while some are `Zigbee Network Layer Data` packets.  The only difference between the two types are that the `Data` payload is 2 bytes vs 11 bytes (respectively).   
   
I realize this is likely a secure/encrypted communication and as a side note I'm also curious if anyone has set up their Zigbee device with their power provider the ""right way"" so they can actually read the packets.

cykm5u,1567400699,Sanity check on starting with home automation,"Hello all. I've been thinking about home automation for a while but finally thinking of jumping in. The only device I currently have is an Ecobee 4 thermostat. 

My biggest use cases are guest codes, timed or otherwise, and receiving notifications when either the doors are opened/closed and ideally when certain codes are used. I'm thinking of purchasing Yale Assure locks (YRD226ZW2619). I want to be able to manage guest codes from SmartThings without having to configure multiple locks manually. 

One of the other features I'm considering is some kind of automatic unlocking of the door based on geofencing/presence (bluetooth or zwave). Kwikset has a touch-to-open feature that uses Bluetooth. I've thought of doing something similar with a presence detector and/or a phone joining the network. Another option was a RFID zwave panel like Zipato RFID reader. 

I've also looked at purchasing the GoControl Z-Wave Garage Door Opener. Mostly this allows me to see if I left the garage door open.

At some point, I've also thought integrating with an alarm system. I'm from Canada and have an old ADT system. I had thought about switching to Vivint since they have home automation but it seems to be locked down. 

Mostly I want to check I'm on the right path. Any thoughts are appreciated.",adanderson,/r/homeautomation/comments/cykm5u/sanity_check_on_starting_with_home_automation/,3,homeautomation,6
cykpqn,1567401335,Insteon Switch Alternative?,"Really new to home automation and completely confused, I'm not sure if I have a grasp on the Z-Wave protocol. I'm looking for a Z-Wave switch that has some of the features of Insteon switches, mainly:

- Insteon scenes can be managed by the switches directly (the switches act as controllers), no hub is required for this communication.
- Insteon communication is broadcasted to the Insteon mesh network, each device repeats the broadcast via RF or PL. If a device fails to receive the broadcast, the controlling switch makes a peer-to-peer request to perform the scene action.

So that seems to roughly translate to a Z-Wave switch that supports:
- Repeating the Z-Wave protocol.
- Acting as a controller (hopefully can be managed by the hub, e.g. ISY). This hopefully means no hub is required for scenes, and not using some weird custom implementation.
- Switch can manage load, but also can control other switches (1 to Many).
- S2 support?
- Instant status support (marketing term?)

It seems impossible to find Z-Wave feature support on the product spec pages, am I just looking in the wrong place?",silvenga,/r/homeautomation/comments/cykpqn/insteon_switch_alternative/,2,homeautomation,15
cykurf,1567402237,Whole-house water leak detection system install report,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I installed a whole-home water leak detection system ([Grohe Sense Guard](https://www.amazon.com/Grohe-22503LN0-Sense-Guard-Controller/dp/B07JH81LRS)) with automatic water shutoff. I wanted to do a quick report of the result and what I've done.

&amp;#x200B;

The plumbing part has been done by a professional plumber due to insurance reasons. I had them do it at the same time they changed my water heater.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pictures of the setup :** [**https://imgur.com/a/UhNgZu7**](https://imgur.com/a/UhNgZu7)

&amp;#x200B;

I have Kitek plumbing which is why I prefer to be safe than sorry, but leaks can happen to anyone. I already had water damage due to a leaking faucet, so I wanted to have some sort of protection.

&amp;#x200B;

This Sense Guard is installed at the main water supply of my condo. It periodically cuts the water and checks the pressure downstream. If the pressure drops, it means there is a leak. Brillant ! There are also other detection options such as a maximum volume per intake (i.e. how much water can be taken between water uses).

&amp;#x200B;

I got the [full kit](https://www.amazon.com/GROHE-22602LN0-Sense-Guard-Security/dp/B07M8NQL7T) which also comes with 3 leak sensor ([Grohe Sense](https://www.amazon.com/Grohe-22601LN0-Sense-Smart-Sensor/dp/B07JG8YGY5/)). When a leak sensor detects water, it will automatically tell the Sense Guard to shut-off the water. I purchased an extra sensor. It's pricey... I wish they were a bit cheaper. It might be a bit overkill to have the sensors in addition of the Grohe Sense Guard, but once you experience water damage, you want to be protected because it's not fun, even if you have good insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem** with that type of leak sensor, and it's universal to all brands, is that you have to make sure the water reaches the sensor before finding a lower point to exit the room. In some cases, you can have a pretty serious leak and the sensor may not detect it, simply because it is not at the lowest point and the water escapes before reaching the sensor. And it's difficult beforehand to tell where is water is going to go...

&amp;#x200B;

So what I've done, and this is what I think is a great idea, is that I applied silicone caulk all around the edge of the room. I did not do that everywhere, only in the most critical areas : the closet in which there is the washing machine, and the other one in which there is the water heater and water-air air-pump. This way, if there is a leak, I dramatically increase the chances of it reaching the probes of the sensor.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, no false alarm, except when I took short pulses of water to rinse a glass very late at night (the Sense Guard does extensive micro-leak testing during the night - this can be disabled if needed). The first time it freaked me out, but I soon realized it happened seconds after I took some water. I figured out if the leak was real it would detect it again, so after checking all faucets and visible pipes, I reopened the water.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other brands of leak sensors, but I only tested this one so far. I was looking for an integrated system with both leak sensors and a whole-home detection system too. Also Grohe is a brand I trust, but I understand it's more well known in Europe, where I'm from.

&amp;#x200B;

I regret there is no Google Home or IFTTT integration. It would allow fancy features such as cutting the water when you are away from the house (for those who can do it - if you have a fridge with an ice-maker, for instance, you can't do that - and you also need to make sure you don't leave with the dishwasher or the washing machine running... but you get the idea)

&amp;#x200B;

I did get a discount from my insurance, and the system will pay for itself in \~7 years. Not great return on investment, but I think it should last that long and it provides some piece of mind. If it can reduce the severity of a leak it will pay for itself just by the inconvenience it saved. If you have a larger house (I live in a condo), you may get a bigger rebate.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this can give you ideas or inspire you ! AMA !",uski,/r/homeautomation/comments/cykurf/wholehouse_water_leak_detection_system_install/,25,homeautomation,20

For the tv and cable I have Xfinity and a Samsung 7 series and while Alexa can connect to it, all it really does is turn it on and off. As far as I know there is no control for the Xfinity through Alexa. I've seen posts about building with raspberry pi  and being able to create commands but if I don't have to go that route I'd prefer not to. Is there something that can add this functionality?

We are making a drag and drop website where users can put some basic logic together and make a custom smart home device. The device can be later repurposed into something else.

The server code that the device will be communicating with will be open sourced (and we will secure multiple cloud providers) with users' right to move their data to another provider anytime. Also we will provide a local app where everything can work without internet.

Our main goal is to break the smarthome devices from being single use single company, focus on reuse and hopefully make a difference.

You can move things around, share or preorder a sketch. It is still basic and we are continuously working on making it better.

We really need your help, and for that we will give the first 100 subscribers a 50% discount whenever our product comes out. You can think of a dongle you needed, quickly drag stuff around and then subscribe to that but get the discount on something else totally.

They don't have any backward compatibility between sensors and the new system or offer any sort of discount to upgrade, so I'm strongly considering switching to a different system (e.g., [Nest Secure](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_secure_alarm_system?hl=en-US)), which is somewhat tempting without the $300/year in monthly fees (unless I pay for Brinks monitoring).

However, there are two features of the current system I wonder if its possible to replicate somehow (using other products):

1. Magnetic type door sensors that can send silent emails or texts.  (E.g., put on liquor cabinet and check teenage babysitter isn't helping herself, etc.)
2. A smoke alarm that can automatically notify my local fire department ([Nest Protect](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_protect_2nd_gen?hl=en-US)) doesn't seem to do this or have options to do this)

For the silent email/text alerts, I don't mind setting stuff up myself or needing to run a server or write a python/other script if there's something with an API (or relatively easy to use arduino stuff for this).  That said, would much prefer something already self-enclosed and battery-powered (versus breadboard or having to get a 3-d printer to make the casing).

(I wouldn't try setting up my own things for auto-calling fire department -- don't feel comfortable with an automated system to call them; would be hard to test without harassing them or knowing how they answer their phones and I believe 911 works differently than ordinary phone numbers.)",djimbob,/r/homeautomation/comments/cz5zni/iot_magnetic_door_alarm_sensor_fire_dept_smoke/,1,homeautomation,7

* Automating non-smart ceiling fans &amp; garage door

My issue is everything I read about the Insteon line is their hubs just continually shit the bed, even on their own subreddit there's complaints not to mention the shit rating on amazon. The counter to that is they have a ceiling fan module for non-smart non-remote controlled fans, and it's proprietary. They also have a module for non-smart garage doors, as my openers aren't that old, they're just not smart.

I've also considered wiring my ceiling fans with a universal remote control and then using Bond, but I wanted to get the opinoins here on Insteon vs Smart Things Hub.

Our addition/garage construction is almost complete and I’m a week away from buying things like bulbs, garage door opener, etc. I wish I had more time to research, but I don’t. Can anyone look over my wishlist and give suggestions?","Hey everyone!

I’m really excited to dive in to home automation!

We are building an addition and attached garage, and my husband is giving me less than a week to make decisions so we can place a bulk order of the rest of our supplies.

As of right now, we have open studs in the addition (family room) and garage, so any wiring that could make my life easier could be done now. I won’t have that luxury for the rest of my house. 

I live in an area where my only options for Internet are a cellular hotspot or satellite internet. We have a 3rd line that acts as our hotspot, but my iPhone makes it super unreliable and it disconnects every 15 minutes. Hopefully I can find a nice router that will accept a SIM, but that’s a problem for another sub. 

For obvious reasons, we need a system that operates on a LAN.

Below is my product list/smart solution wish list. I was looking into Home Assistant and I think I need Z-Wave compatible devices? I just want to make sure I don’t buy tech that conflicts with each other. 

Any advice between controller, ecosystem, or any one of the items below is deeply appreciated. There is way too much information out there to soak it all up and confidently make decisions on my own! 

My List:

- Voice Device - any that work without internet?

- Smart Deadbolt &amp;amp; Garage Door - the ability to lock the deadbolts &amp;amp; close the garage door automatically when we go to bed as well as knowing if it is open or not. The night mode activated by either voice or button on wall mounted tablet. I was looking into Schlage Deadbolts &amp;amp; I don’t know what to do about the garage door as I can’t use MyQ.

- Window sensors - open or closed? Is there one open with the heat going? Is there one open and there’s a storm coming?

- Smart Bulbs -  bulbs that I can adjust warmth, turn on and off, include in programs like night/morning/media watching. Bulbs that work well in recessed lighting are my main focus, but I’ve read that Hue isn’t very bright in that situation. For accent lighting, I’m willing to invest in Hue products. 

- Motion activated lights within a set time period in toddler’s room since he can’t reach the switch &amp;amp; can’t talk yet. Slow wake-up light that increases in brightness at a set time. 

- Strip lights under bed that are motion activated when we have to get up for the baby/bathroom. 

- Whole home audio - considering Chromecast Audio with Bluetooth speakers I already own. The ability to break it up in zones - white noise going in baby’s room while music plays in family room, disable baby’s room when he’s napping, etc. 

- Sensors on washing machine and dryer that will alert me when the cycle is done. Possibly a sensor that detects humidity as my dryer sometimes leaves me with damp clothes &amp;amp; I find out too late. 

-  Smart Thermostat. I don’t have A/C or a whole house fan, but I’d like to program it, know if the heat is on to send notification about windows being open, etc. 

- When we arrive home, I’d like certain lights to come on in the garage, outside and inside, as I’m usually carrying a baby and bags. Not sure if this should be a presence detection situation where it knows no one is home and the front door or garage door opens. 

- Landscape lights turn on/off at a certain time.

- Flood defection - under sink, under water heater, garage floor. Maybe a sensor that lets us know when sump pump engages/stops. 

- Voice announcements for things like time until we have to leave the house to be on time (“you need to be out of the door in 5 minutes.”) 

- Auto pet feeder for 2 labradors. 

- Eventually a robot vacuum because of the labradors.",upnorthbabymakin,/r/homeautomation/comments/czep2k/i_started_down_the_home_automation_rabbit_hole/,5,homeautomation,8

The house currently has a HIVE thermostat and I have looked into hive for the other cameras etc but they don’t appear to have a smart doorbell, which is something we would want. 

Nest also appears to have the whole suite however is expensive and the iOS app seems to be very poorly rated. 

Love the idea of the Nest and ecobee thermostats for their extra functionality. 

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",pobbin,/r/smarthome/comments/d00vr7/moving_house_and_want_to_set_up_smart_home_uk/,7,smarthome,35
d0122y,1567691315,Can someone please recommend a power plug with power metering which only runs locally? No ifttt and such,"Damn that's a long title.So, I bought something like 20 power plugs, different brands and shapes. Of these 20, I was able to use **tuya-convert** on only 2 of them. All the others are patched.

I'm really tired of try/catch and most of all I'm tired of spending money in products I can not use. I really like *Tasmota* firmware because of its nature of MQTT and locally running. I really do not like IFTTT solutions and cloud services.

I do not dare to ""open"" those plugs I bought already to try flashing *Tasmota* firmware, I'm not that DIY geek and especially on those plugs I own, the procedure is tricky on some and impossible (literally, no joking) on others.

I run *Home Assistant*, that's the reason why I'm having so many issues in finding the right power plug.If using the Smart Life component, this does not report power metering.

Can somebody please recommend me \*anything\*, that would connect to the power socket and would report the *Status* and *Metering* to HA ?

I've been living somewhere that I  haven't been able to set up my home automation in over a year, finally moved into a new place that I can set it back up and my router died.  Looking for the suggestions on the best mesh wifi for home automation and that will work well with smart cameras down the road.  

Have been looking at google wifi and have seen some recommendations for Unifi.  I would also like to start transitioning over to smart security cameras so something that would work well with that would be great.  Tired of buying a piece of HA and then finding out later something else would have worked better for what I had planned down the road.

Also on that note, do you guys have suggestions for smart security cameras?  Would prefer for the storage to be local, has to be accessible on my phone, 2 way talk would be great for a couple of them.  Was looking at the nest cams but I really don't want to pay $5-30 a month per camera.... that's just insane.

I picked up the Fibaro Home Center lite to use for local only ZWave (for use with Home Assistant) and the dimmers paired nicely and respond great. They transition up and down when turned on and off and are fast. They're great.

The problem is that they don't report state back to the Fibaro Home Center Lite. I would expect popular dimmers like this would work very well with it. I contacted support and they weren't able to help me, even after logging into my hub to check things. I sent them a template (I can't believe these dimmers aren't already mapped in their software) but they told me it could take months to get to it.

I'd really love to have state reported back.

I actually have 2 zwave networks in my house because I have an Abode home alarm that operates on zwave. I originally was going to just put the switches on it to be my 1 true zwave controller but it was TERRIBLE for the switches. It was slow and lights wouldn't transition when turning on and off.

d04zz1,1567709392,Toshiba Smart Wifi AC - Setup Notes,"So last week, I decided to replace the portable AC in our bedroom with a window-mounted wifi enabled AC from Home Depot, made by Toshiba (8K BTU model). AC install went fine, but I ran into a huge problem trying to get it to pair with the Android app provided by Toshiba. I eventually got it working, leaving some notes here since it appears from the app reviews that many others are having the same problem.

* AC: Toshiba Smart Wifi AC, 8K BTU window-mount model
* Phone: Pixel 2XL (running Android 10)
* Wifi: Google Wifi (2x pucks in mesh configuration)

After extensive frustration and troubleshooting, here are the steps I took which eventually worked:

1. Installed the official Toshiba Android app (Toshiba AC NA) using the QR code in the AC manual
2. Registered for a username and password in the app, and logged in
3. Installed 'MRCOOL Remote' app from Play Store, and logged in with same username and password as created in the Toshiba App (don't create a new account, just log in. This app uses the same cloud server as the Toshiba app, see notes below)
4. Unplugged my second Google Wifi puck, so only the base station was powered up.
5. In MRCOOL Remote app, select for 'Manual' device setup, instead of 'QR Code'.
6. Put AC into 'AP' mode
7. Manually connected phone to the Wifi SSID ('net\_ac\_xxxx', password 12345678).
8. Wait for phone to pop up a warning that the network does not have internet access. Click on the notification, and tell the phone to stay connected anyway.
9. Return to MRCOOL Remote app, and continue through until it prompts to select the home Wifi SSID. Select the correct SSID and enter the password. (I did this on my primary Google Wifi SSID, not the guest network).
10. App will attempt to establish communication with the AC, and configure it.
11. Finish configuring/naming device in MRCOOL Remote app until setup is complete.
12. Exit/force close MRCOOL Remote app, and 'Toshiba AC NA' app, then reopen Toshiba app. The AC device should now show up in that app.
13. Plugged the second Google Wifi puck back in.
14. Opened Google Home app, and clicked to add a new 'Works with Google' device. Entered my Toshiba app credentials in the window that opened, and the AC device was successfully linked with my Google Home app. I am now able to control it using voice commands, though I cannot control it on-screen from within the Google Home app....have to use the manufacturers app for on-screen control.

Note that I had to repeat steps 5-9 many times before it finally succeeded. I was never able to complete these steps without using the MRCOOL Remote app.

**Technical Notes:**

* The Wifi USB dongle in the AC unit says 'Smart Kit', and has a QR code which points back to a URL at domain '[appsmb.com](https://appsmb.com)'. This domain has no IP and will not open in a web browser, but the domain is registered to Alibaba Cloud Computing, and some of it's DNS records point to domains owned by Midea.
* This same dongle appears to be used by many different air conditioners from various manufacturers. There are a bunch of different Android (...and presumably iOS) apps which use the same authentication server, and it seems like you can more or less use them interchangeably. Logging into any of these apps will display devices created in the other apps:
   * Toshiba AC NA
   * NetHome Plus
   * Midea Air
   * MRCOOL Remote
* All of these brands/apps/dongles seem to look for the same net\_ac\_xxxx SSID pattern
* My dongle serves DHCP when in AP mode, subnet [192.168.1.0](https://192.168.1.0). DHCP range starts at [192.168.1.100](https://192.168.1.100), and multiple devices can associate with the AP and each receive an IP. The AC appears to be at [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) and responds to ping, but a port scan didn't reveal anything else interesting
* There is a project up on GitHub where someone has apparently been able to connect to these devices programmatically, but it looks like they may be using an API connection through the cloud server, not a direct IP connection to the device.",Invisible_Blue_Man,/r/homeautomation/comments/d04zz1/toshiba_smart_wifi_ac_setup_notes/,3,homeautomation,0

I thought I would mention it in case there is anyone else with a very specific use-case and too much money on their hands. 

First, you’ve gotta be using only Philip Hue bulbs in the room you want to use this device. Second, you’ll have to pay $40 dollars plus tax per Aurora so you’ve gotta really want a potentiometer-style (no stop or start positions/free spinning) dimmer knob. 

If this describes you, you’ve got to check these out. It’s a free spinning dimmer knob that attaches to a light switch and will control all Philip hue bulbs in one or two rooms.

The Pros:

\-No need to remove the existing light switch

\-5 min install

\-The old light switch can’t be accidentally turned off

\-It uses Bluetooth with latest gen hue bulbs so it will work if the internet goes out

\-Aesthetically it looks like a standard dimmer knob.

That last one is key to me. We are still finishing up renovations of our 1835 farm house and, while we can’t get dimmer that look period appropriate, these aren’t glaringly modern. 

Then again, they are $40 dollars and change a piece and will eventually need a battery replaced. They also can only have rooms of lights assigned to them, not individual lights. Still, they just work so well...  I’ve currently got 7 set up in the house and I’m thinking about getting more. 

So, I’m hoping someone will find this helpful or, at the least, people will have a good laugh at how much money I spent on little white dimmer knobs. Either or both.",ImArchimedes,/r/smarthome/comments/d06gzo/lutron_aurora_my_favorite_overpriced_overly/,9,smarthome,7
d06z12,1567718150,Tropical Storm Automation -- Am I about to reinvent the wheel?,"I had a near miss from Hurricane Dorian, and it gave me a few ideas for making the house smarter when dealing with future storms.

I am thinking of pulling the forecast track, issued warnings/watches, likely time of wind arrival, etc, information from the NHC so that the automation can provide centralized information (I can see this being similar to https://spaghettimodels.com/ when I am done) and perform storm based tasks:

* View basic information per storm (center location, wind speeds, pressure, etc)
* How far, straight line, is the storm from my location.
* Is the storm moving generally towards or away from my location
* What is the closest estimated approach distance to the eye
* What are the wind strengths predicted at that point
* Are we currently in the cone or in a watch or warning zone
* When are storm force winds expected to arrive at my location

Automate-able ideas from this include:

* If the storm is 12 hours away, increase the temperature of the hot water heater
* If the storm is 4 hours out, decrease the AC setpoint to ""friggen cold""
* If we enter a watch, deploy the hurricane shutters
* Announce issuance of watches/warnings for my location
* Some post-storm/on-generator ideas but they are not fleshed out in my mind yet

I'm sure this has been brought up in the past but maybe not. I'm curious what options are working for you related to temperature controlled zones in your home. I've seen options related to smart vents but I'm not sure if this is safe or even efficient. 

As a note, I work from home so most of the house doesn't need to be heated or cooled during the day, just the office. Maybe there is a simpler option...

d084gb,1567723803,Someone attempted to break into my apartment today and I don’t own a security camera.,"First off, thanks to those sorting by new.
Second off, context:
My wife and I live on the first floor of an apartment complex where we have two large glass doors with screens and bars in place. However, I came home today to find both of the screen doors open and the screens on all of the windows broken.  The apartment faces woods and has low visibility from the street.  For obvious reasons this has prompted me to purchase a security camera Incase this happens again.  The things I’m most curious about though in regards to buying a camera are:

1) what the hell is going to stop someone from stealing an outdoor camera at an apartment complex. 
2) If I were to purchase an indoor camera, I’m worried that it too would get stolen upon a break in. 
3) would a trailcam work as a substitute to a traditional security camera? If so, has anyone had success with these?
4) general recommendations for affordable, effective cameras would be awesome.

d0c1vt,1567745389,Advice for starting from scratch,"As the title already tells, I'm starting basically from scratch and am not very experienced. There are a few key requirements for me:

* switches are NOT directly connected to lights - they need to be connected via Wi-Fi
* switches need to be able to trigger multiple 'scenes' by multi-tapping or something like that
* color changing smart lights only (LEDs and blubs)
* motion  detection in two rooms (something like turn on lights 100% at daytime, 15% after bedtime)
* a way to make outlets smart or to put something between an outlet and a light, that is not smart (e.g. Edison style bulbs,  Christmas lights, ...)
* a way to integrate other smart things into routines or scenes would be great (e.g. a 'Netflix scene' triggered by Alexa, that starts the TV, dims the lights and switches to a Fire TV Stick....)

As I am a  mediocre experienced programmer, some programming shouldn't be a problem, however I plan on maybe selling the flat in the future and it would be great (if possible), if everything is  configurable by app, so the next person can deal on his or her own with the setup.

It’s also raised farther above the ground than most switches.

I would like to create a list that i can start purchasing from to make things easy, and flow smoothly.

1. I need a z-wave hub/receiver, or 2 to link, my main floor and my basement.  What is the best way to Accomplish this and the best devices?  About 1000ft2 per floor. [HASS.IO](https://HASS.IO) on my PI is inside a server rack, so I need a standalone device instead of a USB?
2. I need Switches, regular and 2 way, as my house as several of both.
3. Are all in once devices worth it.  Should i buy switches with motion detectors built in, or separate? Same with motion/temp/humidity sensors.  Do they work well or better to buy individuals? Especially when it comes to switches/plugins with z-wave repeaters.
4. Motion/door and window sensors/  I really like the idea of Nests all in one, but dont like that they're on wifi.

d0lkxs,1567799266,Brand New to Smarthome Tech,"Hello everyone,  
I’m going to be buying a home in the near future and from the get go I want to make it pretty smart. I have no experience with any of this going into it so detailed below I’m going to be listing products that I’m leaning towards buying and would love general input from you all as you are more educated than I am. I’m looking to build a list of products over the next two months to buy most of them during Black Friday to get the most savings.  
  
To get started, I plan on utilizing HomeKit for all my control as I’m deeply invested into the Apple ecosystem. Things I already have that I think integrate into the system is an Apple TV, Apple HomePod, a few old iPads, and some iPhones. 
  
Lights:  
I plan on getting a handful of Phillips Hue lights for my ceiling smart lighting. I plan on getting color for rooms that I would use them in and would be getting white only for rooms like bathrooms, guest rooms, etc. Eventually I’ll be adding more ambient lighting as finances allow. My main question here is how many Hue hubs do I need to adequately light a standard 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house? Also I’ve seen things about the hue switches that you can put in rooms. How good are those and are they worth it over traditional switches. I figured standard switches would be fine and I can adjust my scenes through the apps.   
  
Thermostat:  
I’ve been back and forth on the Nest vs Ecobee thermostat. Anyone have any input on which one they prefer?  
  
Doorbell:  
Looking at either the Nest or Ring Doorbell. Still torn on which one I would like and would prefer to not pay for a bunch of services on top of the product.  
  
Security Cameras:  
So here is where I have been trying to do research and have not come up with any direction so far. So, what I’m looking for is a really simple system that doesn’t need a power supply that I need to run to them. Ideally I would like them to be self powered but I don’t know the feasibility of being able to tear some of the house apart and do some things I’m just not that great at. So, battery life is important. I just need a camera covering the driveway and one in the backyard. I don’t need any in the house itself.  
  
Garage Door:  
Again something that I haven’t found a good solution to. I basically just need it to work with HomeKit and CarPlay.",PearlDrummer,/r/smarthome/comments/d0lkxs/brand_new_to_smarthome_tech/,7,smarthome,12

I am considering wink because the app alone controls everything I used except my zwave devices and my home alarm (envisalink). I don’t feel like tinkering with home assistant or other workarounds (have tried and not happy with my success).  Currently I have a SmartThings hub that does part, then I have IFTTT for the other part. I also have an unused Vera Edge controller that was replaced by my SmartThings hub.

The idea of a smart switch that has a motion sensor seems nice as it reduces my overall clutter, but my options seem pretty limited.  Is this because it's not a common use case? And if not, should I be doing things differently?

My primary use case is to have lights come on automatically (hence the motion) but also be able to override that via my automation mechanisms.  An example of this would be turning everything off when I'm ready for bed, or depending on the time of day increasing/decreasing the time the lights remain on after motion is detected.

So far I don't see many options out there, the: [GE Enbrighten Z-Wave Plus Smart Motion Light Switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07226MG2T) seems popular but ecobee Switch+ seems to be the only other option I have found with my googling.

d0ya3w,1567874441,Is there a maintained list of open IoT products anywhere?,"I apologize if this has been asked before, I haven't seen any question alluding specifically to this idea.

What I'm looking for is if there is (or maybe we could start creating?) a list of commercial IoT products of all types (switches, thermostats, cameras, sensors, etc.) are are open-source friendly.

For this, I'd define open-source friendly as all of the following:

* Can be controlled without the use of a proprietary vendor-specific app. (It's OK for it to have one, but the device should expose some form of API - e.g. a REST API or a well-defined UDP packet format - that is well-documented that allows it to be controlled without any app on the local network.)
* Can be set up without requiring a proprietary app and (*especially*) without requiring you to create an account with the vendor. There's a few ways I could see this being done - the easiest would be for the device to present its own WiFi as usual, and when you connect, you can just launch a browser to get it connected to your WiFi and name the device, etc. Or it could even open a Telnet server if you're trying to keep resources down. :-)
* For devices that aren't WiFi based (like Bluetooth LE), have a well-documented protocol so that someone with a Raspberry Pi or can write Android code could easily whip up some scripts to control the device.
* Provide the ability for the *user* to be responsible for securing the device. If, for example, the device exposes a JSON API, the user should be able to setup a security credential that must accompany all requests to do anything on the device. 
* Not required, but even better, would be if there is easily accessible boilerplate code for building interfaces for popular smart speakers like Alexa or Google. But even if that's not available, I know there's already code libraries out there that let you ""simulate"" smart home devices to Alexa and use the smart-home capability to run scripts on a computer, so that would be sufficient.

As a developer, I've had a dream of my own custom smart-home setup that I can control from many places - my phone, my Alexa, and even my web browser. But all of the proprietary junk basically makes this impossible right now. I'm so tired of this obsession with ""WORKS WITH (full in the blank)!"" marketing - a good IoT device should be able to work with *anything* as long as you're willing to write the code or scripts for it. It really is more like ""Works with (fill in the blank) but nothing else"". It's also hard to find any information about this, because all of the reviews tend to focus on UX and services offered by the maker. 

Someone will of course bring up security. My response to that is yes, I understand it's a concern, hence why I'd be completely fine with the idea of a device that, by *default* is closed, but that the user can take steps to open it up. For example, you could be required to download a firmware file and flash it via TFTP (no web). That download could present warnings about you needing to be responsible for the device security, and could also fully disconnect you from their hosted service, making you responsible for hosting and managing your own IoT service.

I found some tips in there forum to hold the black button on the back and plug it back in and wait for flashing in a specific order. This never works I tried it 5 times. Then I found info that said unplug it for 3 seconds and plug it back in for 10 6 times. I did this twice. It’s been plugged in for hours.

I went into the app to remove it and re add it. However per reddit the device locks to your account to prevent reselling so I can’t even try to remove and re add it. The instructions are the worst I have ever seen in a product. Thanks for any help I’m at my wits end.

* Can control a smart outlet. (This is backwards from how most ""smart wall switches"" operate, where they're meant to be remotely controlled themselves.) Ideally [an Etekcity RF remote controlled outlet](https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Household-Appliances-Unlimited-Connections/dp/B00DQELHBS/), but a WiFi-controlled or X10-controlled outlet would be acceptable too.
* Is AC powered, not battery-powered.  Ideally can be directly wired.
* Ideally fits into a Decora plate.

I've seen various RF wall switches (e.g. [a GE one](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Wireless-Grounded-Appliances-18279/dp/B00R7Q7PT4/), [a Dewenwils one](https://www.amazon.com/DEWENWILS-Wireless-Control-Electrical-Interference/dp/B07DT9QP8P/)), the Logitech Pop switch, and the IFTTT Flic, but it seems they're all battery powered.

Motivation:
I have 4-gang set of Decora wall switches.  One of the switches controls a duplex outlet that I would like to be permanently switched on. (I've been told that I can't make it half-hot.) I therefore would like to hardwire it, but I'd like to replace it with something functional. Something that's battery-powered won't work for me since changing the battery would be too much a hassle.

d18gvf,1567931838,HomeAssistant &amp; Z-Wave -Seeming one way communication,"Greetings, fellow enthusiasts!

I've been lurking in the r/homeassistant subreddit for a while now and finally but the bullet and started down the rabbit hole. It's not been a great start!

This is the same question I put in on the HA subreddit but thought this might equally be a good place to ask the community, so here goes:

 

I've recently purchased a Remotec ZTS-500US thermostat and an AEON Labs Z-Stick Gen 5, connected to my CentOS VM that I running HA on. I'm struggling with one thing and just can't work it out despite my best Google-Fu efforts.

Thermostat works great, and paired with the Z-Stick without any issues, which was great. I had some issues getting Z-Wave in to HA but that was just me not setting it up right.

Now that Z-Wave is set up, I can see the thermostat show up on the HA web console, but for some reason instead of showing the model in the tiles, it shows ""climate.remotec\_unknown\_type\_0202\_id\_8170\_&lt;function&gt;"". I updated the manufacturer\_specific.xml file so that the 500US had a type of 0202 as above instead of 0200 which was what the XML had listed previously.

But that itself is not the problem. The problem is that control only appears to be working one way; if I change the function or the temperature setting on the thermostat itself, I can see the tiles get updated on HA ( [https://imgur.com/i9pHJyd](https://imgur.com/i9pHJyd)). If, however, I try to change any of the settings in HA, the thermostat doesn't update.

I do wonder if this is tied in with the fact that the slider on this tile ( [https://i.imgur.com/QhmTpCa.png](https://i.imgur.com/QhmTpCa.png)) won't stay on?

I've tailed the Z-Wave logs in HA and the communications seem fine, so I am thinking it is because the device isn't properly recognised in HA. Here is a snippet:

d19uv7,1567942715,Help me with choosing direction for smart home,"After spending few days online researching for differences between Google home and Alexa I'm still not quite sure what to go with.

Currently I have Phillips Hue lighting in most of my rooms (plan is to go all Hue) and Samsung Q7 series TV.

Also I am planning to buy Nest thermostat as well as Nest doorbell, and most (if not all) my appliances are Samsung smart devices. Forgot to mention Roomba 980.

What I am looking for is home automation and digging deep in automated routines. For example, right now I have ""Good night"" routine set through Alexa which does following:

\-Turn off TV and all lights

\-Leave one hallway light on for 10 minutes, then shutdown

\-Turn on Nightlight scene in bedroom, shutdown after 10 minutes

Also for music I am using Deezer, and for video Youtube/Netflix.

If I understood correctly, Google Home (or Assistant) is missing one key feature that I use here - Time delay or wait function. This is something I really need in almost every routine.

Right now, I am deciding between Google Nest Hub and Echo Show 5 as my next step, and here is where it gets interesting.

Would I be getting anything new (for now and in future) with Nest Hub? Would it make any difference to poor and basic Routines abilities it has right now on mobile app?

Do I need Smartthings Hub (or any kind of hub) if I go for Nest Hub or Echo show 5?

And what blows my mind the most, why the hell do I need Chromecast or Fire TV stick with $1500 TV? It already has Youtube, Netflix or whatever else would I ask Alexa/Google to use on my TV. Does Smartthings Hub make any difference here?

All controlled via SmartThings and Amazon Echo/Alexa. I have no need for cameras right now. I'm not sure if its worth having a smoke alarm or motion sensors etc. 

The Hue lighting is mostly coloured, and it is only in lamps/TV backlighting etc. I am keeping the 'overhead' lights in the house on basic non-smart switches as it isn't always useful to have to dig out a phone or speak to Alexa. The idea is that the Hue lighting will make up 90% of day-to-day lighting within the key areas of the house. 

Set up is as follows:

3 x Voice Assistant  
Army of Hue Lighting incl. Play bar, light strip, E27's etc.  
1x Doorbell  
5x Smart Sockets  
1x Tado Thermo, 1x Hot Water, 4x Radiator  
1x Samsung TV  
1x Samsung Soundbar

I'm posting here just to check it all looks like it works and comes together. I am trying to keep things fairly simple and want as much as possibly to be controlled via one central app (SmartThings). See flow diagram below. A few points I'd love some input on:

\_\_\_

1: Would you do anything differently to the below? Specifically with the UK market in mind. 

2: SmartThings is currently synced with my TV &amp; Soundbar in my non-smart home. It works great as a remote and I have full control when things are turned on. However, the SmartThings app cannot turn the TV on. It can change channels, turn it off.. but no on. Ideally, I want to be able to get Alexa or the app to do this with an 'Alexa, turn on Netflix' and have the TV and Soundbar come on. From reading online, it seems a widespread problem with Samsung TV's (this is a 2016 model). I've looked in to Harmonyhub.. Chromecast.. but I'm not sure on a workaround for this. Comments appreciated. 

3: Would a FireTV stick help my TV problems? I just use the app off my TV at the minute. 

4: Tado look like a strong option, but disappointed with the lack of SmartThings integration. Nest worry me with the closed-circuit and recent divebomb in reviews. Controlling radiators and a central thermostat is great to me, but has anyone managed to integrate it to SmartThings? 

5: Using my soundbar and Echo devices as multi-room speakers for the house. Has anyone bothered to try sync something like a Samsung soundbar with their Echo and have spotify play from both on command? 

6: Is my logic sound? Am I missing any key hubs, devices or operational kit that will stop this from working?

TIA.

d1ac61,1567945956,Harmony elite users: Question about IR and range.,"Hi friends!
2 things I wanted to know about the harmony elite.

1. How far from the hub can the remote be and still talk to it (does it use wifi, Bluetooth, or something to communicate with the hub)

2. Does the remote itself on the elite have an IR blaster? 


I say this because I would be placing the hub in an AV closet underneath the the floor (about 22 feet away, can't run mini IR blasters). And I need some IR signals to come out of the hub and other to come out of the remote (just turning on the TV)

d1hqgx,1567980439,Simple setup for temp/hum monitoring,"Hi folks!

  
From time to time, this simple (as I thought) idea, get's back to me - how cool would it be to monitor temp/hum in 2 rooms in my house (living room + bed room) and have option to compare it with outside temperature (either from some external weather API or my own sensor) - all of it stored somewhere (might be my small computer or cloud) to view and analyze historical data?  


My requirements:

\- no cables ideally, I want battery powered and not-so-big sensor

\- ideally open source software with option to keep data to myself or at least API to get data and analyze myself

\- not so expensive

&amp;#x200B;

\- [https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2) (plugged in to my linux box)

\- Aqara Temperature Humidity Sensor (WSDCGQ11LM)

Unfortunately, after pairing, connection between Conbee2 and sensor is lost. I need to re-pair again and again. It seems that this is known problem. Aqara sensor do not implement Zigbee3 fully (or some other issue with Aqara devices - shame, because they are small and are battery powered).

d1m9sa,1568004774,Help with smart plugs to smart switch,"Newb here. Researched all weekend and stuck. Thank you in advance for helping.

We want our nursery for our newborn to be brightly lit. I bought 3 floor lamps, each running two x 200 watt regular light bulbs. (I’m unaware of any smart bulbs this bright.)

Each lamp is plugged into a different outlet in each of 3 corners of the room.

I’d like to plug them into 3 smart plugs. (First time using one.)

Here’s the kicker: I want all three plugs to be controlled by a physical switch. It’s not necessary to control each one separately. However, if the only way is to use three separate switches, that’s fine.

The problem is all the smart switches I see online are for in-wall installation. (I don’t need this.) They also connect to same-brand dimmers. I also don’t need this.

My wife insists on physical switches. She doesn’t want to control the lights from a mobile device.

Any ideas?

TLDR: need 3 smart plugs to be controlled by physical light switch / physical remote.

Also: if my question exposes obvious ignorance, please let me know where I can go to get the basics. Thanks so much!",Baham99,/r/smarthome/comments/d1m9sa/help_with_smart_plugs_to_smart_switch/,8,smarthome,17

d1vsvq,1568057644,Reverse Engineering Closed Systems (Insignia),"I have spent some time reverse engineering automation devices over the last few years. For example, my Polaris electric pool robot doesn't have a public API, but I've sniffed the flow from the app and have managed to write a library to control it. Similarly, my Pentair pool equipment do not have a public API. People have written software to control Pentair equipment if you hook up a serial adapter to the controller, but not so much for the binary network protocol. So I pulled out Wireshark and spent a few days reversing the binary protocol, and out came a Ruby library I wrote to access it... [https://github.com/kevinelliott/pentair-ruby](https://github.com/kevinelliott/pentair-ruby)

In light of the recent shutdowns of some IoT platforms, such as the recent Insignia Connect shutdown (happening in Nov), I think reverse engineering is going to play an important role in supporting existing smart devices for the foreseeable future when a company goes belly up or decides to stop supporting the platform.

Generally, I prefer to buy Zigbee and Z-Wave devices, since they offer greater compatibility, and depending on how simple they are (sensors) they are easily integrated without OEM support. However, not all devices supporting these wireless standards are simple enough to no longer need their official apps for setup (such as an August Smart Lock, which while it has Bluetooth, Z-Wave, HomeKit, etc, it needs their app in order to set any of it up). Should those apps go away, then guess what, you are likely to have a paperweight.

This is problematic when you have a whole house full of devices, and over time some of them become worthless.

Thus, I'm reaching out to the community to form a team of sorts, to start working together to reverse engineer, document, and otherwise save/salvage/insure devices that offer useful functionality but are at-risk for neutering by their respective companies.

I have a hotlist of products that I'm going to start reverse engineering:

* Insignia Wi-Fi Freezer -- at minimum figure out how to force an unpaired fridge to wifi, and then ping it for temperature and door status
* Ring (I have a Ring Doorbell Elite and a Floodlight) -- Not only do I want to capture existing videos, but I want to be able to intercept the rings (I have already made some progress here, but a lot to do still)
* Arlo (while I primarily use Unfit Protect from Ubiquiti, I have some Arlo Pros that I use indoors) -- Capture existing videos, detect motion, etc. I have started to make some progress here ([https://github.com/kevinelliott/arlo-ruby](https://github.com/kevinelliott/arlo-ruby))
* Unifi Protect -- The Unifi line of networking equipment has a fairly open API (though not well documented) where you can interact w/ the Controller device, and each device also has a local API... but the Unifi Protect line is so new that the API for that is not well known.
* August Smart Lock
* Friday Labs Smart Lock (semi-defunct locks that are awesome)

I have others on the hit list too.

Some of the reverse engineering goals will be:

1. Identify mothership API calls and document them
2. Identify on-device API calls and document them
3. Firmware update process
4. Capture firmware images and create an archive
5. Customize firmware (where possible to replace w/ entirely custom image -- unlikely, but possible in some cases)
6. Create custom open source libraries for accessing the APIs

I realize that in some cases this will touch the boundaries of legality, so I want to be careful that we're not violating any significant laws, and it is not my intention to cannibalize any profits for these companies. I just want my devices to work, and continue to work even when they go out of business.

Take the case of NetGear Arlo. It is their business model to not only sell you expensive hardware, but to then lock you into pricey subscription plans. Fine, they need to make money. I'm not exactly excited to spend on all of these subscriptions (most of us aren't), but if you open up your API and give us access to our content (so we can store it on a local NAS or offsite backup on S3) I will still pay your fees. I imagine a lot of people will. Again, while I'm not exactly excited to pay these fees, I sure do want my videos and motion detections available to me and I'll pay the fees to continue to get them. Since they don't seem to want to open it up, we should open it up for ourselves (or switch to platforms like Ubiquiti that do seem to care about your access).

If any of you want to join me in these efforts, I sure would like us to gather somewhere (perhaps on Discord) and get to work.",AudiKev,/r/homeautomation/comments/d1vsvq/reverse_engineering_closed_systems_insignia/,179,homeautomation,28

ISSUE: When I go into the app to add the device, it starts to set up the connection, but at about 20%, the plug turns off. At 100%, I get a notification that the plug has not been connected.

I've done the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Factory reset the plugs
2. Reset my router

4. Made sure the WiFi network is 2.4Ghz

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!]

Hello all,

My girlfriend and I recently moved into a small 600ish square foot apartment (city life, yay!). Ever since, we've been noticing some odd, albeit non-threatening, occurrences. Of course, we're never home when it happens. Things always seem to be moved around or out of place, thrown into the center of the living room, or completely lost, and things hanging on the wall (rather securely...) near the front door are on the floor as if someone slammed it.

In fact, within a few days of moving in I remember making a comment that someone else must have a key, although I don't recall what led me to initially believe this. Hell, the other day, it was very obvious someone had used our grill. We hadn't touched it since Tuesday, but Friday it's uncovered and the gas is on, and there's a mysterious allen wrench sitting on the shelf. The grill is on our back patio, which is very obviously not a common area.

Oh, and someone peed in our toilet and didn't bother to flush.

Now, after the first few incidences, I chalked it up to me. I easily could have just been drunk/high enough to have forgotten where I put something. However, it has been going on for 2 months now, almost daily. Enough different things have happened that I am no longer a viable suspect. We both work all day, often late, Monday to Friday.

I'm hoping someone can offer recommendations on a reliable, relatively clear pictured, smaller camera, with a decent view size that could at least run from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Don't need anything super fancy or expensive, average will do as long as it can meet my needs.

Smaller is preferred, as I mentioned above our apartment is about 600 square feet. I don't want it to be obvious, because honestly, I'd like to confirm my suspicions and take a few ""sick days"" to make sure I get to meet my new ""houseguest.""

d2bdbk,1568137848,Property manager problems: Contractors that adjust the temperature during vacant units during Turn period.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yxgr0vy6asl31.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33d11fa37d60b7b37661ea55a2d360837ff5c1e7

Many property managers are breathing a sigh of relief that the chaotic Turn is now behind them. During this high-vacancy period, contractors are scheduled to work temporarily within vacant units to get things ready for the next set of tenants - this can include repairs, renovations, general paint touch-ups, etc. Naturally, it’s easier for this kind of work to be completed when units are vacant, but the fact that the unit is unoccupied can present a challenge for property managers. How so?

We often discuss how tenants that don’t pay for utilities are not overly concerned with keeping energy consumption to a minimum - after all, the money isn’t coming out of their pocket. So imagine when contractors come along; they’re only on the property for a very brief period of time so they definitely aren’t concerned about helping lower any bills. In fact, the first thing many contractors do upon entering a unit is turn the thermostat as low as possible in an effort to cool the place off quickly and create a comfortable work environment. It’s also important to consider that because contractors are moving around a lot, they like their work environment to be significantly cooler than normal in order to avoid overheating during their laborious tasks.

Depending on the level of work that needs to be done, contractors tend to spend an average of a few days at a time working in a single residence. Upon leaving the residence at the end of each day, packing up tools and equipment usually takes priority - so it’s safe to say that ensuring the thermostat has been reverted back to its original setting isn’t at the forefront of a contractors mind, and therefore gets forgotten about. This means that in many cases the HVAC unit will continue to run throughout the night, trying to cool and keep the empty residence at 60 degrees (for instance). 

What’s worse, if property staff don’t have a chance to go in and do a walk-through of the residence after the contractor has completed the job, the excessive HVAC runtime can often continue, unnoticed, for days or weeks longer. HVAC units that run excessively can present an array of expensive problems for maintenance teams - frozen pipes being one of the worst.

With the mountains of work property managers already have to worry about during turn period, running around after contractors and checking thermostat settings have been reverted isn’t efficient use of their time. To remedy this common problem, properties should consider installing a Facilities IoT Management Solution. This would provide an effortless way to monitor the temperature (and humidity levels) within each individual residence - and even provide staff with the feature to be able to remotely revert the settings of multiple thermostats simultaneously, removing the need to ever set foot in the residence. 

The [TrustHab](https://trusthab.com/) Solution empowers property managers to take control of the temperature within vacant units, which is especially helpful during periods like the Turn. Reduce unnecessary maintenance costs, increase NOI.

d2czs8,1568144007,How to implement - Turn on specific lights when opening front door (coming home),"Hey guys,

I am slowly but surely getting into the smart home life, after finally convincing the wife to invest some money. I am currently trying to find out what the best way to implement the following idea would be:

I want to find a way to turn on a set of lights (den, kitchen island and a hallway light) when coming home after dark. I am thinking that either a motion sensor pointed at the front door or a door sensor would be the best way to register the door opening. However, how do I make sure that the system understands that I (we) are coming home instead of opening the door to leave? Also, I live in an apartment building, so putting sensors outside the door is a bit more difficult - also because of installation and because neighbors could trip the sensors.

Currently, my system consists of a few hue bulbs + hue hub, the Nest Secure as my alarm system, a google mini, and about a dozen sonoff minis behind every single-channel light switch in the house. The sonoffs are still with the stock firmware, but I'm thinking of flashin tasmota and connecting them to my pi running openhab (currently not in use).

I don't yet have a motion sensor, or a door sensor other than the ones that came with the Nest Secure, so I believe in any case I will have to invest in either one.

I am more than grateful for any suggestion for implementations and products to include in this project. I have a good technical understanding and am not afraid to tinker. However, one big factor is usability to keep the system as idiot-proof as possible for the end-user (wife + small kids). This is also why I chose the sonoff minis so that all light switches would be smart but still work as regular dumb light switches as well.

[Here's a non-smart-home switch.](https://www.lowes.com/pd/TORK-Timers-16-Amp-Digital-Residential-Lighting-Timer/1000341253) You program the switch with your latitude and I think your time zone (close enough to longitude), and it will adjust sunrise/sunset off/on times during the year for you. No cloud-integration, but this works if the internet goes out (which is not uncommon with my ISP unfortunately). Some would call this an ""astronomical light switch.""

I'm wondering if there are smart switches that work the same way or in a similar way. Have Google Assistant integration, but also contain their schedule programming locally so if the cloud is not available, they can at least do on/off times on their own. And if without the cloud they have the programming to adjust sunrise/sunset like that TORK timer switch, even better. That while still permitting control through Google Assistant or other platforms.

I recently bought a Amazon Show 5 and they where running a sale so for $5 more I got a TP-Link Kasa HS105 smart plug. I picked that up because I figured that would be fun to play with.

Right now it’s controlled by either alexa, or the phone app. I’d like to make any non-switched outlet with a lamp in the house be a smart outlet, but the wife won’t go for that because of no remote, and the Show is in the back of the house and she almost never actually has her phone on her, so she’d basically be walking in to a dark house.

I have hue lights, a harmony hub, various motion sensors and light switches and such.

The Homeseer switches and basic hub are in the mail and should be installed soon. I'll have switches going to lights, fans, and in-wall heaters. I'm sure I'll think of other things down the line...

**Questions:**

1. I would like to integrate voice control. Does homeseer have this native? I know it works with Alexa/Google Home, is that what's recommended? Which is preferred of those two? Do I have to say ""Hey Alexa, ask Homeseer..."" every time?
2. I've also read there are 3rd party apps like Snips, but how user-friendly is that to a non-programmer? They seem great for non-internet based systems, and for privacy, but is the use much more limited? The website seems pretty foreign to me. How does this work with multiple users with different voices?
3. I'd like to buy a few of the smart devices that plug directly into outlets. I didn't see any of these through Homeseer. Any suggestions of where to buy compatible devices? For example, I'd like to plug my noise maker into those, so I can have a ""going to sleep"" scene. What am I actually using as a search term to find these?

d2yyr9,1568244214,HDMI Matrix with Harmony Remote,"For context: I am setting up a home automation system for my parents in their new house. One part of the setup will be the HDMI matrix system. They will have 2tvs (1 Samsung Frame 4k and older HDMI Samsung Smart TV 1080p). The builder is feeding 4 cat6 to each tv from where I am installing the rack. There will be 4 HDMI sources, Cable Box, Apple TV, PS4, Security NVR. I would like to be able to feed any of said 4 devices to either of the 2 TV's, I am using 4kHDMI over ca6 adapters to feed the HDMI through the wiring from the matrix system which will be in the rack. I know that this isn't necessary info but I am using sonos amps to power in-ceiling speakers through out the house and the areas of the house that will be fed by the TV's will just have optical or HDMI Arc from the TV to the amp meaning that the matrix system and remote will not have to control the audio system at all (big reason why our family loves sonos) the AMPS will autodetect sound coming from the TV's and direct them to the speakers, no switching on or separate remotes required. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that I haven't worked out yet is remote control. I would like to use harmony remotes as my parents aren't terrible with technology but a finicky remote would drive them insane. The pre programmable scenes on the harmony ultimate and elite remotes look like a good option as they can hit ""watch cable"" or ""play ps4"" and the tv, matrix and device will all set to the proper settings, however, I'm not quite sure how a matrix system would tie in with harmony. The adapters I'm purchasing for the cat6-hdmi have IR in and out on them which I'm under the impression will mean that I can plug one of the IR ports on the harmony into the HDMI adapter and have a IR receiver mounted on the tv itself. Would anyone be able to recommend a 4x2 (6x2 or 8x2 if possible incase they want to add more sources, not necessary) that would pair well with a harmony hub for each tv, or, is there a better brand or way of doing this that I am unaware of. I would really like to avoid using control4 or creston because the pricing is jacked up because you have to go through a dealer and they do not allow for much diy programing and modularity without paying them to do so for you.

d336zl,1568265457,Why does electricity confound me so much? - Can anyone offer some insight into PoE?," 

I am working on setting up a PoE security system in my home.

I bought this [PoE injector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJI0U78/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) which had decent reviews and said it worked great with PoE cameras and IP phones and such.

I intend to purchase a few [Reolink RLC-410](https://reolink.com/product/rlc-410/#specifications) cameras, which say   **Power Supply: DC12V &amp; PoE (IEEE 802.3af 48V Active)**

I plugged in my [Ubiquiti Wifi](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015PRCBBI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) access point, and it works. **( 24V, 0.5A )**

I tried to plug in my old [Foscam fi9821p](https://www.foscam.com/FI9821P.html) using a [PoE breakout](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XMHDETM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and a [Barrel size adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DRQFCH4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) **( 5V/2A original power supply )** \- and I think I fried it.

Of course I plugged all of this in before testing or even looking up any of the power inputs...that was dumb I suppose...

So...The  PoE injector apparently supplies 48vdc ...the reolink cameras say they  have a 12v input but what does the ""48v active"" part mean? Will they  work with this injector? I understand the 48v was WAY too much for the  5v Foscam...but why does my Ubiquiti work if it's input is only 12v? Is  it just built with that much tolerance and it's probably melting under  the strain as we speak?  Should I unplug it and use the PoE injector it  came with before it releases the magic smoke?

Is there a relatively easy way to step down the voltage from 48v to 5v to use my other Foscam fi9821p with this injector?

**Note: I just found This** [**dc-dc converter**](https://www.amazon.com/UCTRONICS-802-3af-Splitter-Ethernet-Raspberry/dp/B01MDLUSE7/ref=pd_sim_b2b_1/139-4488631-9966060?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B01MDLUSE7&amp;pd_rd_r=7165b98b-ed1a-4db3-bc8c-77dd5bcc9155&amp;pd_rd_w=YCTyS&amp;pd_rd_wg=ymc53&amp;pf_rd_p=a07701e4-f565-442a-b97f-93ab23cbb7ef&amp;pf_rd_r=JJZ3RKB7D34C9V4MF4HR&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=JJZ3RKB7D34C9V4MF4HR) **while I was writing this post up...so that answers that question...**

Is  there any way to rescue the one I fried? Is there maybe a fuse in there  or something? I guess I'll have to take it apart to see...but I figure  it's pretty unlikely.

Why is electricity so complicated? :)

-	Play Xbox (Turns on TV, Soundbar, and switches input on TV for Xbox One X, which I manually turn on)

For the life of me, the TV will never turn on when I initiate either activity above when everything is off. The TV is the first action in all of the activities and the stock controller has a separate on/off button. 

When I hit HELP on the remote, it says “Fixing the Activity” and it almost always works and turns the TV on. The off command on the Harmony remote turns the TV off every time, so I don’t think the remote is confused as to which state the TV is in when I initiate the Activity.

My mom sold our childhood home cause my 30 year old sister died there instantly by a fluke health problem and her second husband had a heart attack walking downstairs to lock door and downstairs guy taking a crap. 

So she couldn't stay plus she is retiring in 2 years so she ought the nice double wide and its by the Canada white rock Seattle border. 
Alot of retiring people there 

Anyways I'm gonna foot the bill and start her over COMPLETELY. We threw every electronic out except Dyson vaccum as and a few small tvs

Since its her last place I'm gonna go hard on this. Here is what I wanna do at the best budget I can without getting bad stuff. I tried it it's too much info and I'm not familiar with smart homes. So here is what I want

1.65* tv under $1200 plus tax maybe open box OLED? Lg cause web os easy

2. htpc laptop for Hulu Netflix Amazon crave and cable and IPTV BluRay and windows 10 computer stuff need it able to play Netflix in 4k on it if needed

I am getting wall mount that swings I will buy wireless mouse and keyboard cheap on Amazon

I'm thinking the cheapest gaming one with low end card like 1050 and I slap in either a SSD or a 2tb hd if it has SSD. I want zero slowness

3. Smart Thermostat

4. Alexa hub. There is a sale on echo 2nd gen $79 Canadian and I'm thinking for sure a controller she can carry like a Amazon show
5 inch or 10? She babysits and I want cameras around house. 
So 1 stationary in livingroom and a tablet show or similar and I will get a dot for room. 

4.5 some smart bulbs maybe 1 bedroom 1 spare room 3 living room

5. Camera for carport to see snoopers and maybe 1 inside like a wyze and a second outside one for the back maybe indoor and point out window

6. Ductless Ac but worry about that next summer 

7. Smart lock. Maybe the phone ones not for her
I'm thinking a fingerptint one and smartphone compatible. If need a deadbt get a secure one

8. Doorbell camera so can let people in and see them.  

9. For me important a security system. A normal monitored alarm or smart one that you can't just cut power or Internet on

I think that sums it up. She is paying for laptop htpc and tv $800 and $1200 for budget

d3iecc,1568340676,DIY smart doggy door - bad idea?,"So I've been looking for a smart doggy door that I can control remotely. Our use case is thus: we have a medium/large sized dog with indoor/outdoor access while we are at work. We also have a detached garage in the backyard where we pull the cars into with a motorized gate on the driveway. I'd like to be able to close the doggy door, pull out of the backyard, close the motorized gate, and then remotely open the doggy door so the dog has free roam during the day.

I can't find anything that really works for this on the market without spending $400 to $1800+ (like this: https://plexidors.com/product/plexidor-electric/). So here's where the bad idea probably comes in. Would it be possible to DIY something? Our current doggy door has a small magnet at the base to keep the flap from blowing into the wind. I'm thinking I could utilize an electromagnet connected to a smart socket to hold the flap closed when I pull into/out of the backyard. Nothing security related, just enough to keep the dog in for 2 minutes. I'm decently handy, but this idea kind of seems far fetched.

d3m1ec,1568361868,ZigWaveBee SmartHomeThingsAssistant and a Philips TradFri Nest,"Obviously totally new to HA and feeling overwhelmed and lost by all the info I find everywhere and as such very reluctant taking actual steps.  

I want to get some controllable lights (to start with) and slowly expand: get a smart thermostat, add detection to doors/windows/fridge/taps, basically, the usual.  

What I don't want is loads of controller-devices, protocols, apps. And this is where I get confused about all the stuff which is available. So here's a couple of questions:   

1) I understand both Philips Hue and IKEA TradFri use ZigBee to communicate. Does that mean that if I have a generic Zigbee gateway/hub/whatsyamacallit, both should work? Or if I get a TradFri set, can I later on add a single Hue-bulb?   

2) If I buy a TradFri lighting set now, how committed to standards coming with that am I?   

3) Am I correct in assuming that Zigbee is the 'best' choice right now and for the (near) future, because it (seemingly) has broader industry support?   

4) I would want a single app/interface to control and monitor everything. Both SmartThings and Home Assistant seem to provide that. SmartThings appears to be largely cloud based, which would render it useless for me. So Home Assistant is the better choice (for me).

It has an RF remote.
I have a sonoff rfbridge flashed with tasmota and home assistant.

Normally i would just learn the rf commands from the remote. But it seems that takes an oddball battery (marked 12v 24amp and it’s small and Cylindrical) 

So my plan was to skip over the remote and somehow just send the codes. It appears to be the same remote as most cheap projector screens I’ve found rfcodes for another of these. But I’ve no idea in the world how to get the bridge to send them without learning it from the remote.

I'm just getting started with Smart Home and I currently have 3 Google Chromecasts and a Google Home Nest Hub, and I just got the Govee H6116 I ordered without knowing that it cannot connect to Alexa/Google Assistant. I see if I bought the Govee H6117, I would have the option to connect with Alexa/Google Assistant.. :/

So my question is, is there a way to still connect my Govee H6116 to my Google Home Nest Hub (I ordered a Amazon Echo Dot, so I will have Alexa soon) via Bluetooth via a Smart Hub or something or is there no hope for me here?

Is there such a Smart Hub where you can connect Bluetooth devices/lights/speakers/etc.. to Alexa/Google Assistant? (Or Apple Homepod, Cortana or other that exists..)

They can also work in dark conditions. 

However I was recently talking to a person who, lets just say knows a lot about robot vacuums, who made a case for VSLAM. Some highlights included that they don't get confused about drapes, and that they have a lot of uses for future features and app integration, though he couldn't give me examples of this because many of the projects are ongoing. 

I really want to understand the pros and cons from a more technical perspective. Does anyone out there have strong informed opinions on the matter?

p.s. yes I know that VSLAM can do nogo zones too, but from the early tests I have done they seem far less accurate.",CoverClamp,/r/homeautomation/comments/d47cit/vslam_vs_lidar_robot_vacuum_pros_and_cons/,3,homeautomation,5

You install the app on each devices and sign in with your google ID and essentially your main phone becomes the viewer and the other phones can be set to camera and that's it. You just mount your old phone or tablet on the wall or whatever and when it detects motion, it takes a 30 second clip that it sends to Alfred's cloud server and you can also do a live view-in.

Does such a thing exist? Or is it the mythical beast described in the post title?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

d4nwv6,1568570122,Can I use a thermostat (nexia bridge) to trigger a smart outlet?,"[Similar to this old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartThings/comments/4rjyw8/possible_to_trigger_an_outlet_when_hvac_fan_turns/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I'm wondering if it's possible to trigger an outlet to turn on whenever my HVAC blower turns on? I have an American Standard smart thermostat that's also a Nexia/Z-wave Bridge, and a dumb vent booster fan that I want to trigger via smart outlet. I want the booster fan to turn on every time the HVAC air handler fan kicks on.

I looked at the automations available through my myNexia account, and the only thermostat triggers I saw are based on temperature or humidity. I want the trigger to be whenever the HVAC fan kicks on. Do I need to do this with IFTTT, instead of Nexia? I understand my bridge is IFTTT compatible, but I'd need to set up a separate IFTTT account. 

*Note: I'm obviously a noob to smart gadgets. Please let me know if this is the wrong sub.*

*Note #2:* I'm extremely hesitant to try anything that involves the jumper wire to the booster fan, hence why I'm hoping my smart thermostat can help. I've seen complicated options involving a vibration sensor in/on the HVAC unit, but that seems overkill since the thermostat is a Nexia bridge itself.",ecodrew,/r/homeautomation/comments/d4nwv6/can_i_use_a_thermostat_nexia_bridge_to_trigger_a/,1,homeautomation,2

d4xtfm,1568622790,Caseta install - pico remote + fan questions,"Hi All,

Moved into our home about 6 months ago, and never programmed any of the Caseta switches since I was dragging my feet on getting a 2nd hub.  Lo and behold I (yes very belatedly) discovered the new 75 device limit, and felt like it was time to get off my butt!

General impressions - install went mostly smooth.  Took a little while to get the hub up and running.  Due to subnetting (I have separate 192.168.1.x and 192.168.0.x running), I eventually had to plug the hub directly into the same router as my phone on wifi to get it to work.  Adding switches via app took a little long due to the number, but pretty pleased with ease of use.

Most of all, I was very happy with the coverage.  It's a larger house, 7-8k square feet on 3 levels.  Due to a central location, even switches about 60 feet away work reliably.  The on/off toggles in app are oh so lag free!

Few questions - for the switches I changed a few names to make more sense.  The picos seem to have auto programmed, but they didn't follow the name changes with the main switch.  Totally disorganized, is there a way to figure out which is which before I go back and try each one?

Do picos have to be retained in the app to continue working?  I hit the 75 device limit quickly just hitting the highlights on 2 floors :/

Going to have to replace the on/off switches with some Caseta fan ones.  Anyone know if the dimmer pico will work as a fan control pico in this case?

I have a exterior lights on a rudimentary timer, with the outlet in the garage.  They are LEDs and don't draw much, but was thinking about hooking up the transformer to the Lutron lamp dimmer and see if I can control it that way (says it handles up to 100 watts).  Anyone try this to make electrical plugs smart - or is there a better solution?

Having a few issues with blinking lights, seems somewhat random - both with 1 light situation and in several with 3-4 cans.  I've done some searching and it appears the LUT-MLC might be one solution, but happy to hear thoughts.

Now I'm in this absolute hell where I can control the bulb via its own internal console.  And I can see that the MQTT Broker in Hassio is connecting with the bulb, but I can't get Hassio to register it, and it doesn't show up as a device within the MQTT Integration.

As somebody with a bit of a background in programming, this whole thing has been an absolute hell.  None of the fields are properly explained, and I've found a lot of the wiki pages for things I've found have explained what to do to set things up, but not really gone into detail with why, or what it's doing... I have no idea which fields are passed on where.

It feels like it should be dead simple and straight forward - but after many hours of fighting with it and it STILL not working, I'm starting to wonder if maybe this is all just a big user error?

**In my world:**

- The device should be asking the user what its name will be, and what its location is.  
- The MQTT broker should be creating a database of devices that have connected to it and the location of the devices.
- The devices know what commands and channels they use, so this should be added to the database as well.
- The Home Assistant should be using this database to build its list of MQTT devices that it can control.

But instead, it seems like you have to set up the MQTT settings on the bulb (makes sense) but then you have to manually add the device to the configuration.yaml, which I don't get because you'd think the information it needs could be grabbed between the bulb and the MQTT-Broker?

\- Phillips hue light in living room connected to a motion detector with different brightness options.

\- Strip lights under kitchen cabinets connected to motion detectors. Also would like the ability to set them on a timer.

\- A few motion sensor lights in closets.

\- Motion sensor flood light for driveway.

\- May want the option to integrate with Nest thermostat. That isn't a hard requirement though.

\- Voice control soundbar.

\- I'm not sure if this is possible and may be an entirely different question but would love to be able to voice control my sony smart tv and playstation 4.

\- Roomba set to a timer.

&amp;#x200B;

Really just looking for any suggestions. Thanks!",jdoyle13,/r/homeautomation/comments/d55s6h/do_i_need_a_hub/,3,homeautomation,3

d58rru,1568677525,What ZWave Hub / Platform should I use?,"Hi,

**what Z-Wave platform / hub should I use?**

I am moving into a new house where I wish to use Z-Wave devices.

I plan to use

**Electricity**

* smart switches
* smart outlet
* smart plugs

**Security**

* door / window sensors
* movement sensors
* smoke / CO sensors
* glass break sensors
* indoor siren
* outdoor siren

**And perhaps**

* smart lock
* water leak sensors
* occupancy sensor

Electricity devices will most likely be for automation. Security devices mainly for security, HOWEVER, when I discovered Abode, I liked their new Automation push: https://goabode.com/meet-cue/

I would like to use a simple platform

* Samsung Withings (I understand they had issues lately)
* Wink (are they staying around?)
* Abode

I do not think I'll have the time to use the Home-Assistant.io platform (+ the Wife might be reluctant to use it).

I like Abode as it all seems well integrated, and because most devices seem to be battery-powered, so no need to run that many electricity cables

When I see the list of Z-Wave devices here (https://www.z-wave.com/shop-z-wave-smart-home-products), I am very excited by the possibilities. When I see Abode's compatibility list (https://goabode.com/smart-home/works-with-abode), I wonder if that's too restrictive.

&gt; ***Question***
&gt; 
&gt; What Z-Wave Platform would you recommend?

Many thanks

Context:

* I use a bunch of Google Homes / Hubs / Minis
* Wifi will run on Unifi APs
* I like the idea of a security platform that can also act as IOT platform, à la Abode.
* In the near future, I think I'll install Unifi outdoor cameras",bdrrr,/r/homeautomation/comments/d58rru/what_zwave_hub_platform_should_i_use/,3,homeautomation,32

I want a timer feature that would turn off the outlet 1 hour after it's been turned on (either manually via the button or over MQTT command).  It's for a kids toy that I'd like to not keep on all the time.

The timer feature in Tasmota does daily timers, but can't be configured to do what I'm asking for.

Are there other Tasmota firmware version or some other open source ESP8266 firmware that can do this?  I'd like to maintain the OTA update functionality, MQTT, and the general stability of Tasmota.  I realize I can write code somewhere else to monitor the outlet state and turn it off that way, but I would like a more robust solution that doesn't rely on another computer.

Is there anything I can do to get the plugs to work while staying on the 5GHz band? I've already tried switching to 2.4, setting up the plugs, then switch back to 5, but that didn't work. I will add that I do have a Raspberry Pi running some stuff so maybe there could be a way to set that up as a go-between?

Moving into an apartment with my fiancé whenever she matches in a medical residency program in about 8 months. 

All devices are Apple (phones, iPads, laptop and desktop) 

Looking to add a sonos one two speaker system since Costco has a good price on them. 

My parents used to have an Alexa in the kitchen and it was nice to ask what the weather is like, to play music, etc. 

While I might get into lights, security and more, that is not the main want for this set up. I want to be able to say “hey (whatever) play Spotify (or Spotify playlist)”

I would like a central device. Like those google and Alexa products that have screens. I cook a lot so having a recipe up or even a screen in the kitchen area that can set timers and show weather would be cool. 

Sound quality is important to me for music. 

Would like an ecosystem that isn’t too limiting because I am a tech guy/nerd and would love to expand on my smart device abilities. But first and foremost, want something that will work/be able to be controlled with my Apple devices and just has a good base station for the kitchen area and play music by telling it to (that would play music through the sonos speakers). 

Should I just stick with Apple? It does make me somewhat upset that Siri isn’t as good as Alexa. When we had an Alexa in the kitchen, I was shocked at how useful and better Alexa was compared to Siri. 

Anyways, looking forward to your recommendations. If there is a pre existing post that’s super similar, sorry! Just point me in the right way aha. Thanks!",BrownLiquorDrinker,/r/smarthome/comments/d5hl3w/starting_my_smart_device_ecosystem/,1,smarthome,9

The primary need we have is that we have a home based business and we'd like to improve the primary entry security from our current ""the door is always unlocked"" policy. So the idea is that my wife can be working, see someone approach the door (via new Arlo camera system or something similar) and unlock the door for the customer.

I was looking into locks and if we were to go with the August lock it requires their hub for Alexa support. No problem but I was also looking at getting a SmartThings hub to start to expand our Hue lighting system with motion detection and perhaps some more fun things. Can the SmartThings hub replace the August Connect Hub or does every system need their own hub and SmartThings then connects all of them to each other?

Alternatively I saw that Schlage has a smart lock but it seems like it doesn't have a proprietary hub and maybe can simply use a SmartThings hub to gain Alexa support.

I also downloaded IFTTT, but I honesty have no clue how it works. I have two applets(?) that relate to what I’m trying to do but they don’t do a damn thing even though I’ve connected it all. 

Any ideas? I did purchase a temperature sensor to go with the fan, so I will install that when it gets in and at least I can have the fan turn off when the temperature is adequate, but I’d still like the power to be cut off/turned on when it’s necessary.

d5m06r,1568749017,Ideas for Bedroom/Bathroom Automation (Alexa/Smart Things/IFTTT ecosystem),"TLDR: Sorry this is all over the place.  Suggest something I missed as options for home automation options for a small bedroom with adjacent bathroom.

My family recently updated our bedroom configuration (new closets, bed, etc) and am using this as an opportunity to include home automation as part of the project centered around using Amazon centric assistant (we already had multiple echo dots so it seemed like an easy move).  I'm trying to rack my brain on other basic home automation options I have not directly thought about.  I may extend this to the bathroom as well if I have a viable option.

Current Equipment:

I went with the Samsung RU7100 TV and turned on SmartThings for easy tv on/off (no volume control).  I ordered the new Amazon Fire cube, as my friend has the 1st generation box that he loves and it should come in the next few weeks to help with some of the small TV control things (change channel, start netflix, etc).  I have the fire TV stick for now which I can do basic triggering of start/stop/Pull up Hulu but the FireCube should solve some the ""volume"" workflow that I want to accomplish.

As a most recent addition, I put in a wemo smart light switch (not the dimmer) again, as an easy add on to the room.  I’m trying to think of other basic home automation ideas specifically for our bedroom.  I put in a dedicated Wireless Access Point to run 2.4 ghz for the switch and was looking at doing Wemo plugs for night stand lights (we have not decided on these lights yet.  I've shown my partner some of the phillips hue lights online but they want to see them in person and show off a workflow of how they are control with skills or voice)

I've added in the Alexa skill to:

Turn on/off TV

Turn on/off Overhead Light

Cue up content on the firetv

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has suggestions on the following, it would be greatly appreciated:

(2) nightstand lights that could be controled via voice (I can group them together or turn on/off independly) - I was looking at using the Wemo plugs because I have the dedicated Access Point and they also have the local on/off switch at the plug if the network goes down for any reason.  I could also do routines like ""night time Person 1"" turns off all the lights but their nightstand.

Light behind TV?  Has anyone done this and liked the results.  We will be watching TV a majority of the time in the dark and i've read that bias lights can  reduce eye strain.

Proximity Sensor to turn on the bedroom lights between certain times (6-10pm)?  I feel that this could be a mess if not setup properly.  I could also do something with a nightlight for the bathroom with rules but again, i'm just throwing out ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any other automation options besides the bedside table lights that I should add into the system?  We have 2 lights in the bathroom and i've thought about putting one of them on a motion sensor (with a rule to not turn on at light) but haven't settled on this option yet

We do not need a ring door integration, a roomba, thermostat, or smart locks.  We also do not intend on being in this location for more than 3 years, so i'm trying not to hard wire anything into the infrastructure of the room.  I just have an opportunity to add in whatever options I would like to the system and am asking the internet for suggestions.  I appreciate the suggestions in advance.",enjoysleep,/r/homeautomation/comments/d5m06r/ideas_for_bedroombathroom_automation_alexasmart/,1,homeautomation,1

d5qsnc,1568771156,Need help rethinking home automation in new home,"We currently have a HA system that has been cobbled together over time (started with SmartThings, got some Nest, added Alexa, then Hue, then bought Google but haven't implemented it). 

We're moving to a new (but old...115 year old) house and want to do a reset of our home automation, with the goal of reusing as much as possible, but also going with the optimal solutions. Lately Alexa has been buggy, so we're a bit annoyed with her.

I feel as if we generally prefer our smart switches over the Hue because they work more cleanly -- via voice or switch -- where as the Hue bulbs on dumb switches sometimes require flipping the switch multiple times before they work manually.

The house has a mix of recessed lights, halogens and fixtures with traditional bulbs. (I didn't have a ladder to check every bulb type and the prior owners didn't seem to have converted to LEDs.) There's a mix of single and multi-pole switches, many with dimmers. Only one ceiling fan. 

We'll probably go with Nest thermostat, Nest Protect and Ring doorbells, plus the Yale+Nest for at least one exterior door. We're thinking about going with ADT for home security, but I can't really justify using them for the stuff we'd typically use Nest for -- seems like an inferior product.

I'd love to get people's thoughts on the best products. Lighting is a particular concern, but I'd love to hear suggestions for other HA products. Thanks!",chgoeditor,/r/homeautomation/comments/d5qsnc/need_help_rethinking_home_automation_in_new_home/,0,homeautomation,13

I want to start doing home automation stuff and got a hue bridge and sume light bulbs (ikea tradfri) to start with. The bridge and a light is in the living room, the other lights are downstairs in my office and upstairs in the bathroom. I have tested this setup and I'm really disappointed about zigbee. The range is not as good as my wifi, And when I use the regular switches for some of the light bulbs, it is even worse because they can't mesh when turned off.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking myself why I even should use something like zigbee? The range is bad, I have to buy a bridge and the price is relatively high. Why shouldn't I just use some cheap wifi devices that work without a bridge in my wifi that is already available in every room, even in the garden?

I'm starting a RGB (actually, still undecided to go with other variations such as RGBWW or such) LED light strip project and really love the Fibaro2 Z-wave controller idea for myself since I own my house and getting into the home automation ballpark.  Since this involves crown molding modifications, $$$, and overall look in my living room...  there is something I have to keep in mind.  Resell value of the house.   If I sell my house and the next people come in and know nothing about HA, the Fibaro (or equivalent hardware that's out there) would be useless.  I guess I'm looking for both a smart device/dumb device combo, such as my GE Z-wave light switches or dimmers.  They work with or without any HA.  

To complicate things even further, I would want to have both HA and local control/something I can touch.   I really like the 2nd idea of the RGBgenie touch panel and this would solve the local control issue.  But does not solve reselling of house and next folk come in with no knowledge of HA.

I'm in a lull until a storm gets near again so I can get some additional testing data (forecasted rainfall, properly parsing the time of arrival for storm-force winds, storm surge data, and anything else I think will be useful).  We have Jerry and a couple behind it to get this.

Based on the data I have seen, your best bet to track your local watches/warnings would be to use a custom HA component located here: https://github.com/custom-components/weatheralerts.  This means you will not get per-storm ""in watch/warnings"" but I don't think that is much of an issue.

I am thinking to turn all of this into a HA custom component, version 2.5 of OH looks like it will give me the ability to use wildcard topics and retrieve the topic as well, which I will need for the custom, dynamic, items.

Done a lot of reading and thinking about what I want to accomplish, but there's A LOT going on in this home automation world for a newbie. Luckily I live in a single room, and will only be doing lights/switches/and eventually a smart TV.

What I want to achieve is this: Have RGB lights, LED accent strips (possibly react to music) and a switch for my reading lamp. I want it to be voice controllable, and I want a dedicated ''console'' mounted in place of my current switch by the door with a UI constantly displayed that can run all switches/RGB. Bonus would be if the same UI could simultaneously be accessed via my smart phone, but that's not a priority.

So far I'm thinking: get a google home, some Philips Hue for the overheads, jury rigged Hue LED stips, I'm thinking switches will be the easy part, as well as the TV, with my chromecast, but then this is where I kind of get lost:

For my console, I was thinking of looking at putting together a small touch screen linked to a Rasp Pi running OpenHabian, with a zigbee dongle. Several questions here:

1. Would I still need a Hue Bridge if I have a zigbee dongle?
2. Is there some reason I should be using HomeAssistant instead?
3. Should I look at mounting a dedicated android device instead?

I'm checking whether the plug is off or not in the if-statement to make sure the automation isn't triggered when I turn on the plug manually before. The delay is at 15s for testing purposes. What happens is that after around 15s after turning on, the plug turns off and then on rightaway. It seems to be stuck in a loop. Another 15-20s later it turns off and on again.

I tried fixing this by using two seperate automations for turning on and off, but the problem there is then that every time the motion sensor is triggered the plug is turned off. Meaning, if I turn it on manually, then pass the motion sensor to go to the bathroom, it turns off my plug.

* Ease of use. My wife and I are both new to this and we not great yet at all the different apps and systems. 
* I would prefer that we have to use as ***few*** as apps as possible to monitor, works, etc. the new stuff.

It worked great in the old house, which had very separate rooms, so I just used the virtual walls that came with Roomba to section it off. I ran it everyday and it never missed a beat. But, our new house is much more open. Open enough that the virtual walls don't seem to reach from wall to wall, and Roomba breaks through them.

I'm trying to get a basic set up together, but am getting very lost in what seems like a black-hole of trade-offs and options. I'm hoping I can get some guidance on where to start, and what products to look into.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** Apartment, android phone / google assistant

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I think I will go for peteme light bulbs, smart plug for LED strip, with a google hub / mini for control, and likely getting dedicated speakers with chrome audio in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals:**

**To be able to turn on and off light bulbs + LED strips**

  \-- Example: ""Turn on all lights"", ""Turn on bedroom lights"". 

  \-- Questions:

1. I hear most automation systems you can't put the same light into different light groups?

2. I hear Phillips are the best? These seem expensive, but I don't see mentions of other cheaper alternatives, like the peteme brand, which claims a similar lifespan at a fraction of the price? Are Phillips just more energy efficient?

d76xh7,1569046431,Ideas to make a dumb garage door opener smart,"I recently took a basic smart plug to take power away from my garage door opener to secure it when I want.  I also live in a development w/ a high density of garages in very close proximity and I want to be able to lock it out of someone so happens to have the same frequency.   

From reading through some threads I’ve gathered that we can use a tilt sensor to tell you if your garage is left open. My garage also has a motion sensor across the door to detect if there’s anything in the way or walked in on closing and reverse it.  Can I use that somehow?  

Also, I realized that the door is opened and closed by closing a circuit like the switch does on the wall.  Is there a hack for this?  Like perhaps using a smart plug and a DC relay that can short those terminals to open and close the garage door?",desexmachina,/r/homeautomation/comments/d76xh7/ideas_to_make_a_dumb_garage_door_opener_smart/,1,homeautomation,3

d7bvy7,1569079588,Wired smart switches to control ambiance?,"Hi!

I just bought a new place, and it's a mess. I'm basically getting new ceiling with spots everywhere and new electrical wiring everywhere as well.

Since I'm already doing the work of putting in new wiring and getting new lights everywhere and spending a lot of money on this, I just wanted to get your take on whether I'm choosing the right solutions so I want look back in 6 months wishing I had went with another brand.

In my current apartment, I have Philips Hue bulbs everywhere hooked up to my Google Home. I like the system and when my Hue bulbs doesn't act up, it works as intended. The color changing got old real quick, but I am changing between various types of white several times a day, and could never go back to a fixed ""shade"" of white. 

However, my Hue lights do act up sometimes and decides to turn on a few random bulbs minutes after I turn off everything. I'm blaming the wireless technology and are thus looking to go for a wired solution (Please do correct me if there exist an easier fix).

What I want (In the perfect world):
Smart switches, all wired to the same hub.
(I want to be able to use my phone or Google Home, but I'd like to not have every single switch and bulb blasting out a wireless signal. Hence, all wired to the same hub, which then handles the smart capability).
Bulbs that are capable of being not just dimmed, but also change ""level of whiteness"". Preferably these bulbs are integrated with the smart switches and are thus wired to a single hub as well, instead of each having a wireless signal.
I don't mind if the wall switches only have buttons for on/off, as long as I can do everything with my phone. 
If the tech are sitting in the lamp, rather than the bulbs, I'm looking for recessed LED lights. I don't want the tech in some arbitrary hanging lamp ;)

I'm estimating 30 bulbs and 5-10 smart switches.

Does a system like this even exist?

I've installed bout 6m of 5050 RGB strips on the back of a TV and it works fine with just one colour, but fails when it tries to use 2.

They are running on a 12v 1A power supply which I thought I'd calculated to be enough, but perhaps not.  I've swapped out the controller with other 5050s from other manufacturers and gotten the same result, so I don't think it's a bad controller.

- I want to be able to control the lights with physical switch (I think the Aeotech Smart Dimmer is the best choice for this).

- I want to be able to change the warmth, but only in software (I don't need a physical switch to change it)

- And I'm in the EU, if it matters at all in this case.

What are my options? I'm thinking I would need a smart RGBW controller (preferably Z-Wave or WiFi; Fibaro RGBW Controller 2 perhaps?) between the smart switch and the LED strips.

Just went to install it and had a question for their support team who told me they can’t help with my setup. So now I turn to you lovely bunch...

- I have two switches in the wall.
- Replacing switch on left which controls porch light
- 4 big wires in back of wall box, each with ground, black and white wires. 4th also has a red wire (3-way switch controlling other lights). 

I’ve connected the white wire from new smart switch to the bundle of white wires in the wall.

Now the part I’m not sure about is the ground copper wire from the wall is going into the left switch and then also connected to other switch. 

Same with a black wire, it’s going from the left switch to the right switch. 

Is it just a case of separating the ground wire and black wires between devices? Why are they connected anyway? They should be kept separate?

First, since I’m connecting to a security system with sirens already in place, is it typical to select smoke detectors without built in sounders?  Looks like you can get them with or without.

Second, I’ve been looking at detector layouts throughout the house.  I know detectors are usually located outside each of the sleeping spaces and one on each level by the staircase.  I always thought the reason it was set up this way was to get the alarm sounder close enough to wake up people in case of fire.  If using detectors without built in sounders, should detectors be located differently and have the security system sirens near the bedrooms?

I’ve seen smoke detectors with built in CO detection too.  Should these really be located in the same places that the smoke detectors are supposed to be?  Is it better to keep them separate?

Any other bonus thoughts about 2 or 4 wire preference?  I’ve found lots of info about this out there, but wondering what you all prefer.  Also, is there any reason at all to wire all the detectors to separate zones?  Is there a benefit to knowing which sensor detected smoke?

So I wanted to start a Thread about URC Home Automation as there is not much on Reddit about URC. Everytime I try to look up anything on Reddit about URC, all I find is about UFO's or something like that. So I thought this would be a good place to start so we can all share ideas, ask and answer questions and so on. How does everyone like the New total control accelerator 2.0?  O r what are your thoughts about the new distributed audio amps?  Even the new UI look and the new 1480 Remote? Is anyone getting exited about the new line up that was just announced ad CEDIA? I l know I am!!!

But I have a question. URC says that you can integrate with chamberlain/liftmaster MyQ, but I can not find anywhere on how to do it?! it is driving me nuts. anyone else have that problem? better yet has anyone else figured out how to do it?

I love and hate the google assist feature. Alexa works great and it is very easy to integrate, plus you only have to set up and ling accounts and it finds everything automatically, but google assist you have to create a ""scene"" for each on and off. I had to go to the automation macro's and make an automation macro for each item to go on and then off and type in what the key words are, but on the other side of the coin I love how you can have Google assist respond back after you ask it to do something.

Case in point: my wife has this fan that she turns on every night. so I made an automation macro that when you say ; Hey Google, tell URC its bedtime. Then URC turns off the bedroom tv, the appropriate lights go off and outside lights come on for a couple of hours, the doors lock, the alarm is set for home, and my wife's fan goes on at 65%, but the coolest thing is that then Google  assist will respond with ""good night my love, if you get to cold during the night, just snuggle up with your sexy husband next to you.  LOL, you can make it say anything in response to anything. That's Pretty cool.

When my wife leaves for work in the morning I am already gone for the day, but she will say ""ok Google, tell URC its time to go to work""  then URC will do all the appropriate opperations that I assigned it to do (wont waist all your reading time with all the different operations that it does) but then at the end google assist will respond, "" have a great day my beautiful sexy wife, your husband, (then my name) loves you very much.  This comes in very handy if your in the middle of an argument and then your wife hears that and makes her smile or laugh a little.

d88agu,1569253510,Help replacing 3-way dimmer with smart dimmer,"I'm trying to replace a 3-way dimmer set-up (currently a Lutron MACL-153M) with a smart dimmer. I have C by GE Smart Dimmers. After a lot of tinkering yesterday, I was unable to get it to work. I've made a bad MS Paint diagram of the two boxes the dimmers are currently in below.

Link: https://i.stack.imgur.com/19KDr.png

The first dimmer is in a box with a toggle. There are two black wires (labeled A and B) going into Dimmer 1's common screw/push port. One of these is coming from the Toggle, so I'm assuming that wire's the line from the power source. (I believe this wire also comes from a black wire bundle in the back). Wire B is separate when it comes from the top of the box. The rest of the set-up is straightforward, with red wire on the brass screw and a white wire on the blue screw, and a spiderwebbed bare ground wire running to both the toggle and the dimmer. The one quirk here is that in addition to the white wire coming from the box, there's a separate bundled and capped group of white wires at the back of the box, which I assume to be a group of neutrals, while the white wire from the blue screw is a traveler that hasn't been correctly taped with black. The current dimmer model doesn't require a neutral.

In the second dimmer, there are just four wires. A black wire to the common screw, a red wire to the brass screw, a white wire to the blue screw, and a bare ground wire. These dimmers control 8 recessed lights located physically between the two switch boxes.

Based on studying diagrams of 3-way circuiting, it looks like this is a pre-2011 switch circuit and there's no neutral in the second box. Is there any way to replace this grouping with either a) the C by GE smart dimmers (they require a neutral) or b) some other brand of smart dimmer, or am I out of luck? And if I can use the C be GE, how do I wire it (what would be the 'line' wire in the second dimmer, for example)?

d89rqp,1569259750,[RELEASE] New versions of my zoned Heating/Cooling Solutions with Smart Vents for SmartThings for better alternative cooling!,"Hi,

Just to let my contributors know and all ST users who would like to do targeted heating/cooling in their home that I have new versions of my zoned Heating/Cooling smartapps available at my store :

I made some significant optimization to ***ecobeeSetZoneWithSchedule*** (v8.7.6), and ***ScheduleTstatZones*** (v8.7.6):

* When using the alternative cooling settings to control big fan/damper/evaporative cooler switch(es) and the HVAC fan, the new versions will avoid sending the same fanOn() or fanOff() commands if the HVAC fan is already in the correct fan mode
* If you are already a contributor, you can now download the new version at my store using the original sellfy link.

d8aq27,1569263655,Scene/keypad design principles,"I’ve installed a few keypads around my house and am now trying to decide what functionality to bind to them before I get custom engraving for the buttons.

It seems like there are two major paths people take with them: device/location-centric (e.g,, “dining room”, “overhead lamp”) and ambiance/event-centric (“entertain”, “dinner”, etc.)

I’m wondering if folks know of resources for setting it all up in as pleasant or intuitive a fashion as possible. I don’t want users of my system (my family/friends or potential future buyers) to need an instruction manual to operate it and I also want to not have to press a half dozen buttons to achieve the lighting I desire.

I’m also striving for consistency, so my gate and garage controls are always in the same place on the keypad (bottom) and “local” controls are always near the top.

One possible design that’s crossed my mind: have a whole-house toggle for bright or dim mode, since in general I don’t want jarring transitions from bright lighting to dim between rooms, and then have buttons for logical/physical groupings of lights like “dining room” or “sitting room”. That seems a bit less abstract than “dinner” as a button label.

Anyway, curious if the HA community has thoughts about how best to do this, or if there are external resources discussing good ways to do it.

I have a MyQ-native (but no WiFi) garage door opener and I’m looking for the best way to automate it without being hacky and without relying on remote services. I’d like to use its native sensing machinery ideally since it gives four states instead of just two from a normal open/close sensor.

The claim native support for HomeKit which as I understand it means it’s at least somewhat locally controllable because Apple forces that for devices that work with a HomeKit hub. Am I understanding that right?

Every other API for it I can find seems to take a username and password to get a short-lived token from their cloud service and control it fully remotely.

d8bl58,1569267066,Thoughts on Alexa and the future of hardware hubs,"So I moved about year and half ago and was super excited to get into a new house and automate everything possible. I was and still am pretty green. I bought a bunch of different sensors, a harmony hub and a smartthings hub. I dove in headfirst, intended on using actiontiles for the coolness factor and I like touchscreens. But in the end, I was crushed. Smartthings worked half the time, depending on what app I added things in. I never get actiontiles to work, especially with Smartthings. Most of my devices didn't work. And a third or more of my sensors, especially motion sensors would drop constantly. My alarm siren sometimes would go off 5 minutes coming inside and forgetting to turn the alarm off. Needless to say, I was convinced that this tech isn't there yet. That things don't play well with other. Until I got an Alexa device and every problem I had was resolved. It might not be as flexible as I'd like, yet. But it works and it does a whole lot more and its dirt cheap. My question I guess..do you all see devices like Alexa or Google devices replacing limited, expensive hubs, like Smartthings or having to program a RPi with Home Assistant.

The Goal: over and under kitchen cabinet lighting triggered by motion sensor. When someone walks into the kitchen, I want the lights to come on. Preferably I could program it so this only happens at night. 

What I THINK I need:
- smart wifi LED light strips that plug into outlets
- outlets above cabinets
- some battery powered motion sensor

What I THINK the setup looks like:
- plug led strips into outlets above counters
- drill holes in corners of cabinets and run led strips through to the underside (light on top and on bottom) 
- program motion sensor to turn on lightz

What I don't understand:
What is the difference between the light strip brands? Should I pay through the nose for Philips Hue? Can I achieve the same thing with $14 strips on Amazon? Are the battery powered options safe to use on an ongoing basis? Can they be hardwired without an outlet? Can  I buy one strip and then a bunch of AC adapters instead of a bunch of strips?

Is WeMo the best to look into in this space?  I actually have a few WeMo motion sensors from years ago when they made them and they actually work well ... but it looks like they've gotten away from that.

I'm looking into outfitting my elderly mother's house with wifi and a few Amazon Echo units so that she can call us if she ever falls and can't get up (it's certainly cheaper than LifeAlert).    But I was wondering if there is anything else in terms of rudimentary HA I might be able to hook to it as well - but without needing to deploy an entire hub.  I'm looking for simple stuff - smoke detectors, motion sensors, etc.  It would give me great piece of mind if I could know - remotely - that there are no emergency situations (smoke, water) and see that she is moving around (motion).

At my home, we have a full SmartThings setup ... so I know I could just get a 2nd hub and deploy it do everything I want.  I'm just wondering if there's a way to get some basic integration without something like ST.

&gt;***The idea behind the Roborock S4 is to provide a reliable, LIDAR-based vacuum only option to users who might not necessarily want the mopping function.***

What's new? There are **no mopping attachments**. The S4 can not do mopping but does a decent job on hard flooring.

**Less noisy** than the Roborock S5. The Roborock S4 is not as distracting as the aging S5.

Can be ordered to go clean a certain room or two because of **the selected room feature**. Also, the app is tweaked with zoned cleaning selection and virtual no-go lines to keep the robot off wandering.

A new cleaning roller has detachable tips and is ideal for pet and long human hair along with a bigger dustbin that holds more dirt. Do not forget about a HEPA filter that makes the S4 perfect for allergy sufferers.

Capable of cleaning a multi-story house. The new update allows storing two maps in memory.

The Roborock S4 has the same **2,000 Pa** suction power and 17 CFM of air velocity.

**The most efficient navigation**. The new model was able to finish the job at 34 minutes, where the S5 needed the whole 43 minutes.

Keep in mind, the Roborock S4 is not suitable for homes with thick carpets. The robot is designed for homes with thin carpets and bare flooring. It did not have any issue with crossing my carpets though it was not able to move on a thick shaggy rug. Anyways, you will get a lot for your dollar, a long-lasting machine with strong suction and great cleaning performance, smart enough to recognize your rooms and suitable for homes with more than one level.

* [Thyristor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072WQTBPQ/) - switchable with 3.3VDC trigger (which is what RPi uses)
* [Heatsink\(s\)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078ZXZ1GN/) - I just assume I'll need this - don't want to mess around.

Here's what I passed on:

* [Random WiFi Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PHNZKBT/) - didn't want an unknown service provider involved.
* [Specializing thing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0792S1DGZ/) - too expensive.

Anyone else do anything like this? I'll post an update if/when I get this thing up and going.

It's alright but I wouldn't be heartbroken to switch systems. There's a few things I wish it were ""smarter"" about for instance it never turns itself on far enough in advance to get the house to my preferred temperature after vacation mode and it has even forced itself to use strip heaters to heat it back up quickly after vacation mode instead of just... turning on earlier in the day. For day to day scheduling it's fine though and does its job.

Anyway, we just moved into a two story home and each floor has its own HVAC unit and thermostat. Is there any smart system where you have a main unit on floor one and a secondary unit on floor two that communicates with the main one? Do I have to purchase *two* full priced smart thermostats, one for each floor? I've tried searching but having a hard time finding solid answers on this for some reason.

If it matters, we both use iOS. We have a few echo dots but otherwise aren't tied to any specific ""smart home"" ecosystem at the moment. I would like to get a smart doorbell with a camera eventually.

I assumed it would lose the map as it wasn’t complete like other reviews had said but it charged up and picked right back where it left off.

Older reviews also said that you had to complete a map before adding virtual walls. I was able to troubleshoot mid run and add virtual walls for it to avoid on the fly. 

Once it figured the shape of the rooms it was super efficient in cleaning them and left tidy little vacuum lines on the carpeted areas and had zero problems going from hardwoods to carpet or rugs. It also did an amazing job around the legs of the dining table and chairs.

Just in trying to get my wife interested, Costco had some of those feit color bulbs on sale for like $15,  I picked up a hue 4 white spectrum lights + bridge on sale at amazon during a recent sale that they had them pretty discounted and we have a fair number of echo devices around the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good news is my wife loves the lights, especially the ability to change the colors and brightness. Bad news is she hates always having to use voice for the off/on. With that in mind, I am likely going to have to go the smart switch route. I looked over the wiki and am mostly sure that I want to go the route of something like zwave, but am not sure what hub or anything like that I should even be considering (Hubitat seems interesting). I do have a technical background (Programmer) but I also have a new child, so a system I can tinker with is fine, but I don't want a system that is going to be a lot of maintenance. I'm likely going to be going with the ring security system at some point and I'd like to branch into other home automation as well at some point, like motion sensors, etc.

So my questions would be:

* What would you recommend for hub in this case? 
* Any specific z-wave switches that you folks like (I have a lot of 3 way switches in my house as well)?
* Can smart switches work with hard wired smart bulbs (mostly asking for something like a Hue or Lifx, I assume those fiet ones are gonna be a loss here)?

I need some software outside of Google Maps to 'know' when I'm currently navigating somewhere using Maps on my Android phone, where the destination is, and the ETA.  Ideally this information would make its way to my home server which could make certain automation decisions as a result.

Anyone know whether there is a way to do this (outside of something hackish like screen scraping?)?

EDIT 2: Based on responses thus far, this isn't a thing.  I hope I'm wrong.  Best solution I can envision is having an ""app"" on my phone which, when tapped, does nothing except send current location to a cloud process, and the cloud process's assumption will be that I'm then on my way home.  From there, cloud process will use Google Maps API (in a static sort of way) to determine ETA based on current traffic conditions + current location of phone.  One downside being that updates to ETA will not be communicated to cloud process, so if I stop for something along the way, or traffic worsens (a big deal where I live), or take a different route, it won't be as precise as it could be otherwise.

d9tt7f,1569550090,Combine Nexia thermostat with Ecobee sensors?,"Hi all,

I have an old house with steam heat controlled by an Ecobee and four room sensors. It works great as i can set the thermostat to operate off of a combination of temperature sensors.

We recently got central AC installed and it uses a Nexia (American Standard XL1050) thermostat with built in bridge. It's a totally separate system from the heat. Unfortunately it seems that it can only operate off of its built in temperature sensor. Even an external Zwave sensor can't override the built in one from what i gather. I also noticed that Nexia requires  subscription for most functionality which is off-putting.

1. Is there an ecosystem that i could/should use to combine all of this? I also have a lot of Apple devices. Can Apple Home merge things? We also have a couple Amazon Alexas but i'm not super keen on them and have thought about getting rid of them for privacy concerns.
2. More specifically, is there a way i can get the XL1050 to operate off of the ecobee sensors if i can someone connect them? For example, if i created a temperature variable based on some combination of the ecobee sensor data. Then i used some logic that would adjust/correct the XL1050 temp based on that. Could this be done with IFTTT?
3. Lastly, is there anyway to use the Nexia system without paying the subscription? LIke use IFTTT to connect devices and then just pass them to the Nexia? Seems like IFTTT is free with Nexia?
4. I have no specific goals for home automation in general. I just want to play around with it and add things over time. I like your advice on what path to go down.

d9u9jm,1569552502,Best bulbs for helping sleep? And switches to match?,"I want to outfit our apartment with smart bulbs and switches so that almost every light (probably all exc. closet and bathroom) is controllable with our Alexa and phones, and I can set bedtime and wake up routines. 

Primary motivation? Encourage sleep (late evening) and as an alarm in the morning, simulating sunrise. I struggle to go to sleep and wake up, and am hoping this would help. (Of course, not posting on reddit at 11pm would probably also help)  

I know you need to cut down on blue light waves and possibly even have red lights in the evening. Then you want natural-like lighting for waking up. 

Can you recommend good bulbs for this? Should I get colored bulbs so that I can have them red in the mate evening when I'm winding down before bed? Or just white with a wide range that includes low blue emissions?

I'm trying to avoid Hue bulbs because they're so expensive and require me to get (and hide) a hub. Would prefer no hub with whatever I get, but could be convinced otherwise ... I don't really know all the pros and cons, and the amount of info out there is overwhelming. 

Small 1BR apartment. Have a ceiling fan in the living room with three candelabra bulb sockets. Bedroom has a ceiling light with three standard size sockets.

daki8c,1569698483,Whole Home Audio - need to upgrade my current setup,"I have quite an eclectic mix of smart home accessories, and while i'm trying to get a better way to integrate them all together, my first task i'd like to accomplish is to upgrade the audio around the house. Our house is fairly small (\~ 1500 sq ft) w/ 3 bed, 2 bath.

Right now i primarily use the Google Home Hub to stream music to itself and the mini's as it can be heard across the house, but the SQ is severely lacking. I also want to upgrade the audio for the Home Theater as the dialog on my Denon sound bar can be muddy at times and music is just so so.

My current setup is as follows;

**Home Theater**

* LG 65"" C7 OLED
* Denon DHT-S514 Soundbar (2.1)
* Apple TV 4k
* Xbox One X

**Smart Speakers**

* Google Home Hub (Kitchen)
* Google Home Mini (Guest Bath)
* Google Home Mini (Master Bath)

**Music Services**

* Spotify
* Apple Music

**Lights &amp; Other Devices** (*Not applicable to upgrading sound, but listing for reference*)

* Philips Hue Bulbs &amp; Strips
* Lutron Wall Switches
* Bond Fan Control
* Nest Secure, Protect, Hello, Thermostat and Cam
* Apple cell phones, iPads, etc.
* Mac Desktop

I've been eyeing some of the higher end Atmos soundbar's, (Sony HT-ST5000, Samsung Q90, etc) and while I know i can get better SQ from a dedicated 2.1 system, i have two young kids so i'm not sure i'm comfortable with bookshelf speakers on stands or towers with tiny pokey dirty fingers all around. I've also looked at the Sonos Playbar as Sonos seems to be the best at whole home audio, but feel like the SQ on the Sony/Samsung is a bit better for movies (am i wrong there?).

I also have almost no access to the attic, so wireless is a must.

Ideally, i would like to be able to stream music to the Living Room Home Theater, Kitchen (though nearby the home theater so it may cover both), to the bathrooms, master bedroom and backyard.

Thoughts on what direction to go? I want to have a strategic plan in mind as I take my next steps, and i want to make sure i'm planning both for interoperability, ease of use, and overall SQ. I plan to upgrade in phases, overall budget is around $1500.

daq4sk,1569728296,Rethinking my decision to go zwave for my lighting needs. Zwave vs Insteon vs Lutron.,"I want to redo most of my house with smart switches. I have a list of things I'd like to do, but there are a few of them that are causing snags because I can't seem to find exactly what I want. I had originally decided to go with zwave because of the open standard and lower frequency allowing greater range with less interference. I don't think I have any use cases for smart bulbs over switches.

The only hub I have atm is my Hubitat. Very new to using it.

#Scenario 1: 

In the bedroom there are 2 lamps mounted to the wall; one above my side of the bed and one above my wife's side. The ceiling fan light is controlled through a remote (which I may try to automate at some point as well) and the switch for it just stays on all the time. Occasionally, what happens is we forget to leave the remote near the door and when going to bed have to fumble our way to the bed and find the switch for one of the lamps.

I've 2/3s of the way solved this. There was an unused light switch (old fan had separate switches for light and fan; the new one runs off a single switch and is controlled with the remote). I got a Zooz Zen 21 switch and a Zen25 double plug. I have these both configured, but the lamps are not plugged in yet, because...

**Problem 1:** The lamps will need to be ""always on"", meaning if we are in bed and turn the lamp off using the switch built into the cord, the wall switch will not be able to control the lamp anymore. So now I need a way to turn the lamps on and off from the bed. I have not been able to find any good zwave buttons (though I have found some Zigbee ones, like the SmartThings buttons). For this, the [Pico remote for switches](https://smile.amazon.com/Lutron-PJ2-2B-GWH-L01-Remote-Control-White/dp/B00KLAXOE8/) seems perfect.

**Problem 2:** It would be great to be able to hit a wall switch (single tap to turn 1 on, double tap on to turn both on, off turns both off), but the whole double tap thing isn't intuitive. No one expects a wall switch to do that. A scene controller like [this Insteon one](https://smile.amazon.com/Insteon-2487S-4-Scene-Keypad-White/dp/B005CDXGD8/), would be great. On/off button, plus a button for the left, a button for the right, and 2 more buttons to do whatever the heck I want. I can't find anything remotely close that's zwave.

-----------

I was going to write a few more scenarios, but the truth is I think even though the scenario is different, I will have 1 or both of the problems I listed above. So I'm just kinda wondering what everyone's experiences are with real world setups when it comes to making all your lighting ""smarter"".",waterboysh,/r/homeautomation/comments/daq4sk/rethinking_my_decision_to_go_zwave_for_my/,3,homeautomation,8

I'm new to home automation and everything in this field.

My server is also in the cellar, but having concrete walls, this might limit the protocols I'm able to use. That server is not a RaspberyPi or any of these things, it's a regular X86\_64 server I built.

So far, my head is spinning from all these different protocols.

What is the bare minimum that I need to send this information to my server without spending hundreds of euros? And please don't just throw some product names at me, be a bit more beginner-friendly (like: get some ruuvi tags, a raspberry pi with module xyz, connect them with foo bar and install baz to send data off). I'm not interested in getting the data on my smartphone, just logging it centrally and being able to graph it. I'm living in Germany by the way, so regulations might be different I suppose.

dbe7m6,1569861320,My Automation Manifesto,"I’ve been trying to codify my feelings and goals as I try and automate my surroundings. I’ve moved from an apartment to a house and it’s a wonderful blank slate for automation. Few of the devices have remotes, but the goal would be to consolidate those into an app on my phone. The fewer physical devices the better. I don't have infinite space in my brain to track where I left all of the remotes. I have a tendency towards aimless wandering so I need a North Star, rules to obey, and a goal in mind. I think I've distilled all of my thoughts into 3 points, or 2.5 points depending on how I'm feeling.

Firstly, automation must make my life easier. There’s no point to most automation if it’s creating more work for me. If automating a task takes more time and effort than performing it manually, it will not fulfill my desire to be the laziest version of myself that I can be. Checking to make sure lights are off at night, vacuuming floors, and repetitive mindless tasks can all be automated to take out the effort and human inconsistency or forgetfulness.

Second, the automation must work. This could be assumed, but there should be a definition of what I mean when I say work. Automation can be effective and efficient, but when voice assistants like Siri or Alexa are introduced it can become frustrating. Something that works 90% of the time can be incredibly frustrating. Just when you get used to something working, it fails. It feels like such a betrayal, a stab in the back, for this small piece of inanimate plastic to refuse to do what you asked. So I’m looking for a high completion rate. 

As a third, final, or maybe a subpoint to both of the above: maintenance should be minimal. Constant maintenance that causes more work than the original task defeats the purpose of automation, unless it’s a pet project.

The main inspiration, the first moment automation clicked for me, scratched that itch of efficiency and usefulness. The third time I came home to a Roomba vacuumed apartment, I had scheduled it to run automatically while I was away from the house at work. The first two times were cool sure, but they were initiated by me. I opened up the iRobot app, hit the start button, and followed it around my apartment watching it clean. I had scheduled it to run automatically while I was away from the house at work. I never had to think too hard about vacuuming my apartment again. Sure the poor little guy had a thing for trying to choke to death on socks, but the niceness of coming home to a vacuumed apartment far outweighed the few times I had to lift up the plastic puck, pull a sock out of its brushes, and set it back down to try again in a few days. Once I broke my bad habit of throwing socks around my apartment, I achieved maximum laziness to reliability. I wouldn’t see the robot vacuum for weeks, but my floors were never overly dirty again. The little robot made my life easier. I didn’t have to expend 30 minutes vacuuming my apartment anymore. The most effort I had to exert was maybe pulling the thing out from a corner it got stuck in, or to save it from choking on a sock. The little robot just worked, and that’s what I’m looking for.

Lots of people ask about smart bulbs but I don’t care about colors or color temperature. But it does bother me a bit to have a dozen mains-powered AC bulbs each with their own electronics to drive/dim their own LEDs when all the LEDs run at low voltage.

What are my options to set up the room with a sensible low voltage LED lighting system, ideally still with replaceable bulbs? I see a lot of these 0-10V controller circuits and ELV dimmers and so on, and am trying to figure out what I should actually be aiming for here. Or if I should just bite the bullet and go for mainstream 110V LED bulbs.

&amp;#x200B;

So finally getting ready to setup my home automation and have some questions as I am putting a bunch of my earlier devices together with newer ones and want to make sure I do everything right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have listed all the devices i can think of that i currently have but probably have a few more i forgot about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to hang a Apple Ipad (v2-3) older one at the entrance to the house as a push button home automation for some things. for example lights on, or lock door after we leave, show Nest hello camera video when someone rings door bell and use for writing notes for each other (reminder pad before leaving house)

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of that we would use google home / amazon echo/dot for voice commands.

&amp;#x200B;

but for automation and to make everything work together what should i use? I Was thinking the Wink2 as it seemed to work with Nest? Also Samsung smart things possibly? I know people will probably recommend Home Assistant, but was hoping to use something more user friendly. i could probably figure it out, but rather not have to spend hours to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Devices I have:

Nest Hello

Nest Camera

Nest Door lock

Nest thermostat 

Wyze Camera x 2

Google Home x 2

Amazon Echo

Amazon Dot x 2

Philips Hue Lights

Zooz Z-Wave Plus switches x 6

dbjvu4,1569884339,GE dimmer switch not responding to off commands from hub,"So this is the weirdest thing.  My switch will turn on, will dim to any setting between 1-100, but will not physically turn off via my hub.  The switch will poll as off, but nothing actually turns off.  It works fine physically from the switch and can control the on/off of another switch I have associated to it via double tap.  The switch in question also responds to double taps (on or off) from another one located elsewhere in the room.  So I know it can process Z-Wave commands to turn off.  Am I looking at a hub issue or a switch issue.  And if the answer is ""welcome to the struggle of home automation"", well, fair answer...  Didn't know if anyone had experienced this before.

Edit:  This is not a new install.  Been working for the last two months and just noticed it the other day when Alexa wouldn't turn off the dimmer.

dbkd80,1569886482,Possible inverted wiring? [Lutron Caseta dimmer not fully off],"Hello, looking for some assistance here.

I just replaced my light switches with Lutron Caseta smart dimmers (PD-6WCL). I am 100% sure I installed them correctly, according to the instructions for 3-way switches and the previous wiring: I bypassed one 3-way switch and added the Pico remote at one location, and wired in the second location (ground to ground, hot to hot, and traveller to traveller). There is no neutral.

They dim properly, reaching full brightness, but they are still glowing (at very low light) when they should be off.

One option is that the LEDs are not compatible (I would have to climb on a ladder and tear them apart to know the model), but could the issue be that whoever did the original wiring inverted the load and traveller? There were two black wires and one red wire, that appeared to be installed correctly on the original switches.

Should I try to invert them back? 

I don't want to blow up the dimmer experimenting.

Any tips? Thanks.",dodsferd22,/r/homeautomation/comments/dbkd80/possible_inverted_wiring_lutron_caseta_dimmer_not/,3,homeautomation,8
