dbojk4,1569906913,TP-Link HS210 Weird in 4-Way Setup Only 9 Months Later,"**Edit:** As of today (4-Oct-2019) this is 100% resolved. I didn't catch the firmware version of the switch before today, but right now it's on version 1.5.6 if that matters.

**Original post:**

I'm hoping you guys can please help me here because TP-Link so far hasn't even been able to grasp the problem.

Let me explain.

I have a 4-way lighting circuit with three switches controlling the lights: a 3-way switch to a 4-way switch to another 3-way switch. Nine months ago, I replaced just one of those 3-way switches with a TP-Link HS210 3-way switch. I didn't expect it to work as they say it's designed to work in pairs, but it did work and it's been working fine this whole time. Using the TP-Link Kasa phone app or even Google Home, I was able to toggle the HS210 to control the lights on that circuit. I could even turn on the lights using the other 3-way switch or the 4-way switch and use the app or Google to turn off the lights. The HS210 knew if the lights were on or off and it just worked perfectly.

Fast forward to yesterday when I asked Google Home to turn on those lights. Google did so and audibly confirmed the action. I then asked Google to turn off the lights and this is where it gets weird... Google audibly tells me that it turned off the lights but the lights stay on. No matter how many times I ask Google Home to turn off the lights, the lights stay on. In fact, with the lights already on, if I ask Google to turn ON the lights again the lights now turn OFF. That's actually the only way I can turn off the lights with Google Home anymore.

And things are weird in a different way with the TP-Link Kasa app. It's just one button you press. If the button is grey it means the lights are off; green and the lights are on. I press the button on the screen, the lights turn on and the button on the screen turns green. If I press the button on the screen again, that button turns grey (which is where the lights should be off now) but the lights STAY ON. I have to press the button a second time turn turn off the lights, but the button turns green again (as if I just turned the lights on) for about a second and then grey again on its own.

I'm at a loss here. I feel like a silent update happened and broke this. Is anyone else in the same boat as me? Any ideas?",RizzleQ,/r/homeautomation/comments/dbojk4/tplink_hs210_weird_in_4way_setup_only_9_months/,3,homeautomation,0

dbqkc2,1569920297,Any thought about the Dyson 360 Heurist?,"Recently Vacuum Wars released a [Dyson 360 Heurist review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDVl6EP42FY). As much as I love some new features the whole new things leaves me frustrating. 

It is small in diameter but at the same time is tall so it can get into narrow places but not under furniture. It has zoned cleaning (the first camera-based robot in the industry btw) and a new navigation pattern but it spends the whole 40 minutes to finish a small room. Considering it lasts up to 75 minutes on one charge (based on what the manufacturer claims), it couldn't finish a two-bedroom apartment without recharging.

It has a nice charging dock but along with other things that are good-but-not-so-good, the Dyson is a weird product. 

And **$1,200**? Thanks but no.

dbqqal,1569921430,Advice on Smart Hub choice - 'complex' switch behaviour,"I’m just starting ‘smartifying’ a new home and looking for some guidance on what smart hub to use.  Currently using a Hue hub with a few switches and Philips and Ikea lights, I'm beginning to want to do some things that I don’t think Hue can do:

I’d like to be able to use a single Philips Hue Dimmer switch to control multiple lights independently. For example: a bedroom with a main ceiling light and two bedside lights each with a dimmer switch nearby. One click of the on button to turn on the bedside lamp on my side of the bed and another click to turn all the lights on, and similar for off but in reverse.   Another example would be to press and hold the on button to cycle through the lights in the room (each flashing briefly) - when it gets to the light I'm interested in I could then use the remote to change scene/brightness for that light alone.

Can SmartThings or Hubitat handle this - I'd prefer something fairly low maintenance - I’m ok writing drivers/python scripts, but want something my family can understand and use and I can sell with the home in a few years - ie preferably not relying on additional apps, internet service, or raspberry pi and dongles

Any ideas appreciated.",andrewsmallbone,/r/smarthome/comments/dbqqal/advice_on_smart_hub_choice_complex_switch/,10,smarthome,17

dbsw98,1569934104,Recommendations for a smart thermostat.,"Background:
I have a 3 story home with two dumb thermostats (one for the main floor and one for the top two floors located on the second floor). 
We also have a 5 month old baby so our schedule is irregular. Monday's I watch him and am in and out of the house, Tuesday's he is usually gone with his Grandma but she might be at the house, Wednesday's and Thursday's we have a nanny come to the house (I would not connect her phone to my thermostat) and Friday my wife watches him and is also in and out of the house. Additionally almost every other weekend we are gone.

Moreover, our thermostats are located along a hallway so I am worried the motion sensor will not work they way it was meant to. 

Finally, I use SmartThings to control every other aspect of my smart home.

I was leaning towards the Ecobee as it integrates with SmartThings and has the remote temp sensors. At the same time I like the Nest because it ""learns"" your schedule but I feel our schedule is too variable. I also love the away mode if the thermostat senses no one is in the house (hence why the motion sensor in the hallway could be an issue). Could I set up motion sensors to extend the smartness of the thermostat?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",drewrriley,/r/smarthome/comments/dbsw98/recommendations_for_a_smart_thermostat/,11,smarthome,15

dbud1f,1569940932,"Trying to figure out the best way to have ""night lights"" triggered by motion using my existing lights.","My main motivation is we will be moving our toddler from our bedroom to his bedroom soon. I want it so that if he gets out of bed in the middle of the night he'll have some light to see. Would also be useful for myself or my wife if we need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. I think there are 2 ways I can go about this; either way requires me to purchase new bulbs because none of my current ones are dimmable.

This will be aimed at the hallway, the kids bathroom, and the master bathroom. Our living room area actually has nowhere for me to put a Hue bulb because the light in the fan uses two of those small clip in halogen bulbs (which we rarely turn on) and a light fixture on the back wall, but it's the kind that has the LEDs built in.

The hallway has 2 (or maybe 3, can't remember off the top of my head while at work) recessed can lights. The guest bathroom has 3 lights over the mirror. The master bathroom has 3 lights over the mirror and 3 lights further back by the shower (2 separate switches).

1. Smart dimmer switches with regular dimming LED bulbs and motion sensors. This is probably the most straightforward way and the cheapest. I'm currently building out my zwave network, so zwave swtiches and motion sensors connected to my Hubitat. Create a rule so that between certain hours, if motion is detected turn the lights on at some low % brightness. The main downside to this is the white will still be white.

2. Smart switches (that allow the internal relay to be disabled like the Zooz Zen21) with smart bulbs and motion sensors. This would basically be the same as option 1, but would allow different colors/temperatures to be set for the lights. So for instance, for the motion activated night light, I could have the bulbs be red so as to not ruin your night vision. If needed, the up paddle could be hit to override the nightlight and turn the light back to a certain preset. I have to admit, part of the reason I'm considering Hue lights is because of their [integration with my Sense energy monitor](https://community.sense.com/t/whats-new-in-v22-philips-hue/3026). I could shrink the ""unknown"" bubble down some.

I'm still trying to find some good reviews of the Hue bulbs; mainly focused on how the white light looks on the color bulbs because that's what my wife will care about the most. The [starter kit](https://smile.amazon.com/Philips-Ambiance-Starter-HomeKit-Assistant/dp/B07R1NMLL4) that comes with the hub and 3 bulbs is currently on sale for $100",waterboysh,/r/homeautomation/comments/dbud1f/trying_to_figure_out_the_best_way_to_have_night/,6,homeautomation,27

My understanding is that the wall switch is closing a millivolt circuit generated by the thermocouple, so although it looks like your typical wall switch it’s actually not mains powered and is switching a barely detectable voltage.

My current thought is to use an Insteon IOLinc with the device for its relay to close the thermocouple circuit, but unfortunately that’s quite bulky and designed to be plugged into the wall and I don’t have space for that near the fireplaces.

I would also like to be able to control the flame height and maybe the fan, so I’m wondering if I’m going to have to rig up something custom or if others know of existing solutions.

Has any one had any problems with energenie/MiHome recently?
I have 4 light switches, 3 power switches, 1 monitoring one and a motion sensor.

About 2 weeks ago the app and site suddenly started saying that the gateway has not been seen for a day; nothing worked.

Repairing worked but then the gateway disappeared again.

I deleted everything and created a new gateway on the app from fresh but 
I noticed however that the power switches will pair correctly but the motion sensor and monitoring power switch refuse saying pairing error. It's like the gateway cannot 'see' any thing that feedback data or signals to the gate way I.e. power switches don't feedback wether they are on or off and pair correctly but the monitoring one does send an okay signal, the motion alarm a motion signal and both of those refuse to pair in any way.

dce47v,1570040347,Need help installing Z-wave light switches -- SO MANY WIRES!,"I can typically figure things out when I install a new smart home gadget, but I think I'm in over my head on this one.

At my front door, there are two standard (non-smart) toggle switches for an exterior light over the door and the interior light at the door. I bought two Honeywell Z-wave toggle-style smart switches to install so I can automate these lights with my SmartThings and Abode systems when we come home.

Apparently, that's easier said than done.

It *looks* like there's a neutral wire here, but it's weird because the neutral seems to be four separate wires that came out of four different wire bundles (excuse the incorrect terminology) and are twisted together and capped with one of those plastic capper things. There are no other unused wires, so I would assume this four-wire bundle would be my neutrals, but I don't know how to connect two Z-wave switches to that bundle. Do I need to divide those four neutrals into two separate neutrals? How do I know which two to pair? Or do I just connect the switches to that whole bundle, which would make it a 6-wire bundle?

Wires 2 and 3 are confusing me, too. The second wire feeds into the back of switch A, then wire 3 wraps around the screw adjacent to where wire 2 goes into switch A and continues into the same spot in the back of switch B. Not sure why you'd connect the two switches with wire 3 instead of having wire 3 go directly into switch B, but I'm assuming there's a reason? Do I need to keep this setup for the Z-wave switches?

I also don't know which wire is which on the old switch, which makes it difficult to know whether I'm putting each wire in the right place in the new switches.

I tried installing one of the Z-wave switches in place of switch B with the neutral added to what I assume is the neutral bundle,  but when I turned the breaker back on that switch worked. I couldn't figure out why, so I ended up putting the original non-smart switch back the way it was.

I drew [a diagram of what the setup looks like currently in its default form](https://imgur.com/a/BowTQyG). The wires connected to the switches are coming from the same bundles as the neutral wires, but I didn't connect them in the diagram as I didn't want lines going everywhere to confuse things. I have wires 2 and 3 labeled as power because I assume that's what they are, but I still don't know what the others are. The new Z-wave switches require Line, Load, Neutral, and Ground. The ground wires aren't in the diagram because I know which one that one is.

If someone could tell me whether, for example, the Load line is at the top and the Line wire is at the bottom of the non-smart switches, then I'd know where to put the wires in on the new Z-wave switch. Also, I need to know whether or not the new switches need to be connected to each other with wire 3 like they are now.

HELP!

dchtw8,1570055843,Smartening up the soffits,"I am in so over my head it's not funny.  I use Phillips Hue lights through Alexa. I want to put these lights along my soffit in the front and back of the house.

I hired an electrician, who said he would give me a break on the price if I bought everything needed for the install, as that would save him time.

Stupidly, I accepted the challenge.  So, I've heard I need a housing for these lights. What I thought was a housing turns out to be a baffle (great name, as bafflement was my response upon learning there was a difference.) 

 So what I really need, I discovered,  is a 6 in. Recessed Wet-Rated housing at a reasonable price -  (hopefully under 15 bucks each) I need 12 of them, and they need to fit in a soffit.  There have never been lights in this soffit before, so do I need new construction or remodel housings?

I read somewhere that you must have the right gage wire for outside - and I cannot find out what that gage  is. 

Then there are transformers and voltage meters and some guy in a comment section said you have to get the outdoor rubber casing for your wires. 

????

If you haven't yet caught on - I'm not a handyman. I'm a theatre human who has an interest in aesthetics.

Thanks for listening - I await your collective wisdom.

P.S. Are these housings as completely wrong for a soffit as I fear they are?

dckw6b,1570070752,[Question] How to make my Hydronic Heating system smart?,"My house has a hydronic heating system. Each room has a thermostat. Each room also has a vent that blows out hot air when on. Each vent has a high/Low/Off switch to control the fan for that particular vent. I've attached pictures of each below.

I imagine for the thermostats, I can replace them with smart thermostats. There are 5 total across my house, so I'm wondering if there's a preferred brand for multi-room control?

Having to deal with those switches on the vents is kind of a nuisance. Ideally, I'd love an automated solution that turns on and off based on the thermostat temp. e.g. if the thermostat is turned up, the fans go on. Is there any way of accomplishing this? Maybe a switch and thermostat that works with IFTTT?

Hi guys, just looking for some advice. In my living room.I have 2 hue bulbs in lamps, and 2 hue play bars behind my TV. They show up on the Alexa app as individual devices, but also as a device listed as ""living room"".

I have three groups set up:

\-Living room: Living Room Echo dot + the device called ""Living Room"" which is all 4 hue lights.

\-Lamps: which has the two Philips hue bulbs in

\-TV Lights: which has the two hue play bars in.

When I set these up, they all worked fine, after a while when trying to control just TV lights, or just lamps (changing colour/brightness) Alexa will say ""Lights doesn't support that"".

If I remove all the lights from the Alexa app and re-add them, it works again for a while, and then the same.problem again. Anyone know how I can fix this?

Is the error caused by the fact there's a device listed as ""Living Room"" that covers all the lights in the room?

Possibly including the ability to power the outlet on / off from my smartphone or a central control panel.

I know if I had designed the house and planned all the electrical I could set it all up either inside the breaker panel or in a separate panel next to the main. This would be so much easier. I definitely do not mind tinkering to get something to work but I don't want to try something that has already been proven not to be a viable option.

Later I will move onto monitoring water consumption at each faucet / appliance, this would help find faulty appliances or leaks much quicker, if you included the ability to turn off the supply to a specific faucet or appliance you could save yourself a huge expensive headache later as well...

So far I understand how to:

\*That I'll need to drill holes in the vertices to run extension wires soldered to the strips  
\*Install the flush LED channels into my wood carcass's

\*If I'm running channels on the top &amp; bottom of (3) 24"" wide units how do I avoid voltage drop off?  
\*What is the difference between a 12V &amp; 24V system - is one better than the other?  
\*Is there a way to install channels inside the drawer units? If so can they be connected to some type of a switch that turns them on/off automatically?

As posted previously, my current setup is Nest (heating/hot water/smoke/CO2), SONOS, LightwaveRF, LG Smart TV, and tied together using [HomeAssistant.io](https://HomeAssistant.io)

I don't want to maintain my own HomeAssistant box, I'm not happy with Lightwave, and we're about to remodel the entirety of downstairs as well as add some new rooms upstairs, so I'm looking for a solution that will do lighting, blinds, velux-style windows, radiator valves, and can be expanded in the future to include outdoor lighting etc.

The SONOS, and LG TV, are not up for negotiation - I've looked at HEOS and other alternatives, but we don't have the space for a ""proper"" home cinema and the SONOS price-point is pretty much our sweet spot for budget vs. functionality in that area.

I'd prefer to keep the Nest stuff because it works.

Security is something that we need to add to the house, so I'm looking for a system that could integrate/provide with that as well.

I've looked at Control4, KNX, and many other options, but I'm starting to settle on LOXONE because of features (the ""tree"" in particular looks good because then my electrician only needs to run one cable!), expandability, and price.

I will be getting trusted electricians to install, and I will be configuring it myself.

What do I need to know about LOXONE before I start pricing up etc? Where are the downfalls and the flaws? What do you love about your system if you already have it installed?

NEW REVIEW HERE: https://old.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/dfscj3/review_update_sharkiq_r101ae_vs_neato_d7_vs/?

--- BELOW OUTDATED ---

[Link to the bot.](https://direct.sharkclean.com/16/products/shark-iq-robot-self-empty-vacuum-rv1001ae/18/microsite/ogv/?opt=2)

I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying how good it is and that youtube channel that does vacuum reviews is apparently getting slammed by it's review of the bot being very biased and just trying to make it look good.

I'm comparing this to the NeatoD7 that I returned for this unit. In the end, I regret doing that. This and the D7 are the ONLY robo vacs I've ever owned. Trying to find a good one. Had the D7 for about 2 months. Had the Shark for about a day (Yea...not good...).

My house is carpet, tile in only wet areas, about 2100 sqft, one floor, wide open areas, not a lot of furniture in the way, 2 people, 1 border collie/lab mix, 1 European shorthair(TIL) cat.

Feature | Shark | D7
---|---|----
Run Time | Will need multiple charges to do the whole house. I've ran it THREE times and it hasn't even been able to clean 2 rooms. Has been cleaning the same few rooms because it can't find the dock... | Needs to charge once for whole house. Can do full clean of public areas (rooms closed out about 1500sqft), in TURBO mode, with some left over.
Battery Charge | 4 Hours from 0 - full | About 3 hours from 0 - full
Find Dock (Same location in house for both) | Says it's docking, but instead continues cleaning (?) and has no idea where the dock is unless it's inches from it. | Beeline to the dock, no problem
Mapping | Has to run multiple times to get a map. Not sure what the number is as the low battery means it's going to need a lot of cycles. | Able to map in one clean cycle but the clean cycle needs to finish WITHOUT any interruptions. Once mapped, for some reason it always ignored the back of the couch even though there was plenty of room for it go behind there.
NoGoLines | No (Maybe future update?). With it's low profile, it looks like I don't need it, it did get stuck on a ledge though | Yes. Needed it to stop it from going under some furniture.
Cleaning Pattern | This is an odd one... Doesn't do exact straight lines but are slightly slanted(?). There is an invisible section in my living room that it doesn't seem to want to clean. Just goes back and fourth. Doesn't seem to care about areas it missed | Tries to map out rooms by making a perimeter, then cleans the inside. The lines are actually straight. Does a great job in making sure the missed areas are cleaned before moving on.
Maneuverability | I felt like it tried to get around things a bit better than the D7 but it would give up too easily.| Would keep trying to get around certain chair legs. Actually did a great job trying to get every inch of the floor
Profile | Great low profile but got stuck on ledges that D7 was able to get out of | Gets stuck under some furniture as the lidar makes it just tall enough(only a negative when mapping for the first time. Had to babysit it a bit)
Resume Clean | Not sure... as I've always had to manually dock it and it seems to just restart. | Works perfectly after charging.
Clean Modes | Always cleans in normal mode, have to manually set to Turbo every time. Can't set in schedule | Can set default clean mode and also adjust modes in schedule
Software | Can't say much about it. Seems to work ok, just no map yet... Can't tell if it's docking because of low battery or because it's bin is full | Lost connection to wifi a couple of times I had it. Lost map of house 3 times and had to redo it. If a room is missed while mapping, you'll have to delete the map and start all over again. Notifications don't tell you if the scheduled cleaning has started, just when it finishes, sometimes walked into an unclean house because of this.
Dust Bin | Very small | Biggest one of all robo vacs, as of now. Still had to dump it out after every clean (3 times a week)
Auto Clean Dock | Yes. Works very well. Yes it's loud but it's for like 5-10s. No need to purchase bags. | No
Hair Tangle | Yes, right down the middle | Yes, All throughout the brush and bearings
Overall Cleaning | Didn't pick up all debris even on Turbo mode. | I felt like this thing picked up a lot from the carpet. The bin being full every time was a good sign that it was doing very well.
Side Brushes | Has 2 with 1 arm and actually spins on the carpet. Slow moving and long enough to send debris to brush | Has one with 5 arms and struggles to spin on the carpet. Spins a bit fast on tile so it tends to throw things around.

TL;DR Returning the Shark, D7 wins by a long shot, and testing out the Roomba S9+ next, especially for the no hair tangle and better mapping. If not, will return that and probably go back to the Neato unless something else comes along. I know these 3 are not in the same price point.

ddbn5o,1570215075,Smart Driveway Sensor/Alarm,"Are there any good, reliable driveway sensors out there that actually integrate into a Smart Home setup?  For example, if someone comes up the driveway (a car, person, animal, etc.) and it will send me a notification on my phone.  I've been searching around and haven't come across anything really.

I did come across the Guardline Wireless Driveway Alarm on Amazon link to it here: [https://www.amazon.com/Guardline-Wireless-Driveway-Resistant-Detector/dp/B00HFZUKGM/](https://www.amazon.com/Guardline-Wireless-Driveway-Resistant-Detector/dp/B00HFZUKGM/)

This shows some promise as it has a terminal strip on the receiver end that I quote ""Receiver includes a 12-volt relay to add wired external alarms, chimes or bells"".  Once I saw that I started searching for some type of smart switch that will get triggered by that relay.  Then I can setup some IFTTT applet with some push notification.  Or maybe an applet that can, for example:  Motion Detected in Driveway --&gt; Guardline triggers relay --&gt; Some smart switch, status is now ON --&gt; Use IFTTT to turn on Philips Hue lights in Bedroom or change color to red or something.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically what I have are two questions:

1. Is there a true Smart Home Driveway sensor out there already?
2. or, if not... Is there a smart switch that accepts a 12V signal from the Guardline Wireless Driveway Alarm that I could use to rig something up?",sonnaps,/r/homeautomation/comments/ddbn5o/smart_driveway_sensoralarm/,4,homeautomation,4

Just want to throw out an idea to surpass (in my opinion) GE’s latest smart switches. Y’all need a dimmer switch with a motion sensor built in. Nothing is more appreciated than not having to always replace batteries, hide wires, or have ugly motion sensors mounted all over the place. Not to mention an integrated motion sensor means your switch doesn’t necessarily have to be connected to a hub to turn on with motion as this can happen locally within the switch. 

Would love to see this come to life!

Starting to get into the more nitty gritty of home automation. I recently purchased one of [these](https://mirabellagenio.net.au/downlight-rgb%2Bcct).

I followed [this](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Mirabella-Genio-Bulb) guide on setting it up.

For example, if I send /cmnd/color ""ff00ff00"" I get the whitest brightest it can go.

for ff0000ff I get a dim yellow/green

00ff0000 gives me a warm light - close to 3200K

According to this tear down of an (albeit different) Schlage lock they appear to have a MCP1702-3V linear regulator. According to the data sheet it can accommodate up to 13.2v of input voltage. The two 14500’s would provide nominal 7.4v (up to 8.4v). 

What may not work is an accurate battery life monitor. But if I can get longer usage as well as be rechargeable, this seems like an ideal solution. More so over NiMH which wouldn’t provide enough voltage.

The box looked a little beat up, but I was so excited that I couldn't care less. Who doesn't love a good deal? He said GE had discontinued them and took out a permanent marker and wrote $10 on it. Now I was over the moon. I told him he was the man and continued shopping. I went to look at outdoor weatherproof boxes to put it in for my backyard string light project. I wasn't sure how big it was, so I took it out of the box. Something wasn't right. It said ""Leviton"" on it. Bastards. My wife suggested it might be a GE subsidiary or just had different branding and I said ""no, I've been bamboozled"". For a couple minutes I wondered whether I should even buy the thing. I was worried it might be paired to a previous network and I wouldn't be able to pair it to mine. I'd be nervous returning it because obviously it's not the correct item.

I'm making an Android app which aims to help power users get better control over their home automation on mobile devices. I want the app, Mocha, to actually be useful to the community and I can't do that without your help!

Mocha basically lets you create scripts that resemble and function much like traditional scripting languages without having to type so much using the on-screen keyboard. These scripts can then be triggered manually or as the result of an event (*if this then run script.*)

Full screenshots of the current very early version are [available here](https://imgur.com/a/saVrD9W) (also showing a dark theme), but here's a quick preview:

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment no direct integration with anything exists, so testers aren't expected to own any specific HA/smart gadgets. All a prospective tester needs is:

* A device running Android (or a custom ROM based on) Marshmallow or above.
* A bit of time to spare.
* Previous scripting or programming experience is appreciated, but not a necessity.

I am grateful to anyone willing to lend a helping hand and to show my gratitude the app will always be free to early testers, and that goes for premium in-app products as well. Mocha is also very young still and not yet open to the public, (in fact, only you guys know about it yet) so testers will have a fair bit of say in how it develops.

If you want to help, please post here or send me a direct message. It would be nice if you could mention what type of device you have and your Android version (e.g. Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, Android 9) as well, to help me get an idea of which systems the app is being tested on.

\*\* Will I be able to use all the Abode devices (except the hub and keypad ) in a Noonlight monitored setup?  
b. Home Automation: Keep Hubitat if it seems to meet my needs, and if I keep Abode, if there is eventually a connection between Abode and Hubitat so I can use data from the Abode devices in Hubitat.

ddu55y,1570313490,Fixing Raspberry Pi GPIO LIRC Infared Device Control on Buster,"# Background

**Skip to the last section if you just want to solve the problem.** 

Sorry if anyone feels this shouldn't be on this sub, I just spend so much time smashing my head against this I don't want anyone else to do the same.

I use a Raspberry Pi with an IR LED to control/automate my entertainment system, and I recently got an RPi4, which meant I needed to upgrade to Buster. Upon migrating my software over I found that *irsend* commands wouldn't get received by my TV, soundbar, etc. Essentially, the control was very random and I couldn't rely on it.

# Finding the Problem

I found that *irsend* commands were less reliable when CPU usage was high, particularly with odd kinds of tasks. I had the idea that the CPU was getting interrupted in the middle of an *irsend*, and the command was getting broken. Killing background tasks did improve reliability, but not very much, and it's pointless if the Pi can't do anything else. Fortunately, RPi 2/3/4 has 4 CPU cores, so I have an idea... 

I used *taskset* to set (almost) every running task to only use the first three CPU threads, and *lircd* to use the fourth. Then I isolated the fourth CPU core so nothing would be scheduled for it and, sure enough, I have not had a problem since. The first three CPU cores will be used as normal but I'm essentially gimping the Pi by one core. This isn't a huge deal with how much software is single-core optimized, and I don't even have a fan so thermal is likely my limit anyway, so it shouldn't have a noticeable practical impact on performance. 

I'm not too happy with the solution, however, it seems like the kernel isn't properly prioritizing the daemon. If anyone has a cleaner solution, I'd love to hear it, but I worry it involves rewriting the kernel or at very least rewriting GPIO-IR, and/or lirc, etc.

# Solving the problem

**This will disable the fourth CPU core of the Pi for general use.**

1. Install and configure LIRC, I won't go over this, but I recommend following [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=235256&amp;p=1487659&amp;#1438740) if you're on buster.
2. Disable the fourth CPU core by adding ""isolcpus=3"" to ""/boot/cmdline.txt"" (it's a single line, just add a space and isolcpus=3 to the end.)
3. Have the LIRC daemon run on the fourth core by editing ""/lib/systemd/system/lircd.service"" line 10 ""ExecStart=/usr/sbin/lircd --nodaemon"" to ""ExecStart=taskset 0x8 /usr/sbin/lircd --nodaemon"" (read up on *taskset* for more information on what this does. Basically it just runs lircd on CPU 4, rather than whichever one is available.)
4. Reboot.

That's it, the daemon will run by itself on the fourth core so it won't get inturpted anymore, send normal *irsend* commands.

We currently have:

Lutron caseta switches and LBDG2 hub, wemo dimmer switches, wyze cameras. 

Nvidia Shield Tv, 4k fire stick, Roku Ultra which I'm mentioning in case they can be automated somehow with hub.  Nvidia is our primary daily driver. 

Hub features we'd like:

Voice control with wemo, lutron, and Nvidia shield tv.
Digital picture frame/screensaver.

ddwaou,1570323377,Trouble installing smart switch in gang box,"Hello! I’ve purchased an Insteon dimmable switch to replace a standard on/off switch, housed in a four-gang box. I can see 6 white wires bundled together (neutral), 3 pairs of black wires (line/load) as well as a black+black+red for a three-way switch. Grounds are also bundled together.

To figure out the line vs load, I had used a voltage detector like the instructions ask.

Because the original switch only needed the two wires, I had to break up the common bundle to make two smaller bundles bridged by a short 12 awg wire.

After wrestling with all that wire, I got everything in place and after returning power to the box I don’t see any power indication coming from the Insteon switch. All other switches continued to work (including the one on the new neutral bundle).

Has anybody else ran into anything like this? I’m not exactly sure what I can do to test the switch to make sure it’s not DOA.

Any advice is appreciated!",tuddrussel,/r/homeautomation/comments/ddwaou/trouble_installing_smart_switch_in_gang_box/,8,homeautomation,8
ddwp1j,1570325431,Wiring Lights,"Hey, all. I recently moved and either the wiring in this place is different, or I've gotten dumber. I'm trying to install smart lights w/ dimmer option, &amp; when I flip the breaker back on, power returns to the room, but the light &amp; fan don't function. The original light switch was not using the neutral wire, I'm pretty sure I identified the ground wire correctly, I used the black wire as the live wire, and this red wire as the load wire. The fan side, which I haven't yet modified in any way, has two black wires and a ground wire. Any ideas?

de6aqj,1570382813,Best home automation systems to start simple (e.g. driveway monitor) and gradually get more complex?,"Hi. I am new to home automation and recently purchased some Ring components thinking I could start simple and gradually build out a more complex system but I was severely disappointed by the lack of flexibility in the Ring system. Are there other systems I should consider besides Ring?

All I wanted to do was set up a couple motion detectors and have an audible message or alert play inside the house, preferably with a unique message or sound for each motion detector.

I bought 2 Ring outdoor PIR motion detectors, a Ring Bridge, and a Ring Chime Pro.  Everything was easy to set up, but I was surprised to find out that the Ring Chime Pro would only work with specific Ring devices (e.g. doorbell) and could not communicate with the Ring Bridge and, indirectly, the motion detectors. Also, the only way to get notification that a motion detector was triggered is to receive a notification on your smartphone. And, in iOS, there is no way to configure notification sounds that are unique to an app or unique to the type of notification. Also, I frequently forget to enable audio on my phone again after turning it off at work, so a standalone device is necessary (i.e. something like a Ring Chime Pro).

In addition, it looks like only a couple automation features are available for Ring in IFTTT and they are both for the doorbell, only.

As I mentioned, I am new to home automation but I am familiar with things that have been available for years, like IFTTT or all of the smarthome devices I would see advertised.  I just assumed that all of these devices could ""talk to each other"" through common protocols *(since it almost the year 2020)* and that the major players, like Ring, Nest, etc. would support these protocols. *(Naive, I know)* I have the know-how to hack together stuff with Arduinos and Pi's but I don't have the time and I hoped things had evolved a bit to be easier to connect. At the very least, I expected them to be connectable within a single vendor's product offerings. *(talking to you, Ring)*

Am I missing something here? Is there any one system that will be a good foundation with more flexibility than the others that may also play well with the others?

Thanks

EDIT: Thanks for all the great suggestions. It's good to know there are some decent options out there. Right now, I'm leaning towards SmartThings because it seems to offer a good combination of low startup cost, decent usability, and support for endpoints that could be used in a different system. HomeSeer looks like it might be a little more flexible but the startup cost is a little higher and it looks like it could be a little more complex to set up. Home Assistant looks great, and if I was more industrious, I would give it a try.

So why not replace the power cord? Cut the power cord at the level where the switch currently is and add your own ""smart"" cord with it's own switch.

de8qdg,1570393093,Power Monitoring / Kill-a-watt,"Hello,

Years ago I had a Kill-A-Watt to move around between outlets to check the power consumption / cost of different items.

It worked well enough, and once I got readings from the majority of my items and made records I gave the device away to a family friend to use. 

Now we are in a new, larger home - and I was on Amazon to grab another one and I realized there is probably a better / more modern way to do this. I see a lot of the 'smart plugs' can do power readings - but looking into those eventually lead me to whole home automation with all the fancy stuff you all do. We are not there yet - however...

What plugs / system / technologies should I consider, assuming that this simple project will eventually bloom into more 'simple projects' in the future.  Currently would like to monitor power usage, controlling outlets would be nice. Lights / Doorbells / Door Sensors will come later.  Being able to tie into one interface / ecosystem would be great. I do enjoy tinkering, so the more 'open' the better, as long as I don't have to constantly monitor things to keep them working.

I would eventually like to do some full outlet replacements in the wall in some key areas, but plug in outlets would be fine to get started so I can move them around to get some basic readings first.

dec2xa,1570408934,Smart Home Automation &amp; Security First Time Setup,"Goals:  


1- Self-Monitored home security with LOCAL camera storage, unless there is a system that works well with smart hubs like SmartThings. Would like to have ideally about 3 outdoor cameras, 1 indoor camera, all with motion detection and outdoor with night vision. Around 4 window sensors, 4 water sensors (kitchen, both bathrooms, laundry), 2 smoke/co detectors, and a motion detector for living room. 

2- Some light switch controller for each room with motion detection so I can turn each rooms main lights on/off on an app or the lights can turn themselves on from motion in the room, and a few smart bulbs in areas where I'd want specific lighting (master, den, living probably). Smart ceiling fan for living room that turns on with motion detection (either the fan is smart or the motion detector in the living room can tell the fan to turn on itself). Whole home audio system, probably Sonos as it seems to have the best clarity without being mounted inside the walls. Some form of smart screen/tablet in kitchen for displaying recipes or news/weather. 

3- Smart appliances, specifically washer/dryer, and dishwasher, so I can set them up to operate only during off-peak electrical hours. Also, a smart coffee maker would be great. Thinking Keurig at the moment for that and Samsung for the other appliances.

So my question would be, is there any ecosystem I can jump into that will cover each point individually at least? Like one ecosystem for local/self monitored security, and one ecosystem for audio/lighting? Then I'd need a hub, thinking SmartThings at the moment, for setting up scenes and IFTTT.

dejzqz,1570457603,New house - preparation for the future?,"Hello together,

I know, there are several possibilities for smart home:
- every actuator can be connected to the internet by wlan directly 
- all the actuators can be connected by a bus system and the central unit is connected to the internet 

I know, knx is the new standard and that it is possible to use this via a fourth wire for example. (If available)

If you build a completely new house and you want to prepare it cheaply to be ready for the smart home future: would you use only four-wire cables in order to be prepared for a house-wide BUS system? Or would you leave it away because the future lies in wlan anyway?
Is a fourth wire a huge advantage in the future?

What are other cheap and easy measures to prepare for the future and what do you think will be needed, that can be done easily while building a new house but only with a lot of effort later?

I saw there are Globe Electric brand bulbs there which seem okay, but there aren't that many reviews.  Does anyone have any experience with them?  I'd mostly like to know:

* Are these comparable to Philips Hue or another well-known brand?
* Can I still use the normal light switch with these?  It's a push-button switch, not a flip switch E.g. I can turn them on using the light switch, then turn them off with my phone and turn back on with the switch?
* Is the app well designed or intuitive?
   * Can I create a widget or something on my phone so I don't need to open the app each time?  I'm not really a phone programmer guy but I know some apps let you make widgets from their functionalities

del1z9,1570462359,Smart lights options to solve my problems?,"
Hi I have several things I need to fix in the apartment. Looking for advice on how to resolve these problems. I'm thinking smart lights would be the solution

So just to make sure I'm getting this right. With smart lights I'm able to change the color temperature. 

Smart switch I'm unable to change the color temperature

If I were to go the smart lights route I would need to replace all my current dimmer switches to just a simple off and on switch. 


1st problem:
Dimmer switch installed in the kitchen controls two recessed lights. One of the lights makes a buzzing noise when turned on. Maybe is just a loose light? They both look like the same bulb not sure why one makes a noise and the other does not. They both dim with no problems. 

I will probably switch both lights to Phillips hue led bulbs. I would need to replace the switch from a dimmer swtich to just a regular off/on

2nd problem:
Two of the bedrooms have a pull down chain light fixture in the closet. I would like to replace them and maybe add a wireless remote since there is no off and on switch. I assume the best way to do this is buy Phillips hue bulb? And pair that with a wireless remote. The fixture looks a bit old. I was thinking of changing the fixture out. is there a fixture you guys recommend I can buy without changing the box above that would work? 

3rd problem:
Dimmer switch in the living room is a knob turning dimmer. That is old and cracked. I assume I can just swap this out with a leviton dimmer switch and everything will work? Would the leviton dimmer switch work with the Phillips hue white ambiance? Or since it's a smart ceiling light I just need to buy a simple off and on switch https://www2.meethue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-ambiance-being-ceiling-light/4100448U7


4th problem:
Flip switch on/off for hallway the light flickers I assume this is the fixture and not the switch. I will probably swap this out with a Phillips hue  white ambiance ceiling fixture.

5th problem:
Foyer dimmer switch is old and cracked. The fixture flickers and doesn't dim. I assume the reason why is this is not the correct light for a dimmer switch. I can do the same as problem 3?


Any advice or help is much appreciated. As Im new to this and trying to figure out everything.

deusyz,1570507065,Value of smart home in 2019 new home build,"Hey guys, going through the process of building a home now and learning a lot.  

I initially wanted all sorts of smart features, but am starting to think smart home is really still a hobbyists world.  

I have a few devices that truly matter, a smart thermostat, a smart sprinkler controller, and an alexa (of dubious use for anything other than music to me) .

Those were all set and forget.  As I look more into features I want, I'm realizing the act of getting smart items to speak and work with eachother is a big time investment, one that I dont feel like making at this point in my life.  

I'm trying to figure out if anything is going to be worth the money during the build to include.  Everyone says solar prewire...I happen to live in one of the only places in the country that so far has no roi on solar because power is so cheap.  Doesnt make fiscal sense at this point, and the wiring isn't a huge cost later dosn the road.  Builders agent advised against smart switch stuff as well, saying it would be better to do it myself afterwards.

Essentially I'm wondering if anything is really ready for primetime now, i dont want another hobby.


Side note, I'm going way overboard with wiring, enet everywhere, under eaves with outlets, on thebceiling, all ran to a centralish closet with speakers, coax, enet terminated there in a built in panel, so I'm not a complete dummy, I just am leery about spending thousands of dollars on 
devices that will really take my time away.

Edit: Seems like folks think I'm trying to add monetary value to my home - I'm actually currently building it (framing now) and am curious for others thoughts on what smart additions are actually valuable to you as a person - I gave my background as a primer of sorts so people don't blow smoke up my ass. This will be a forever home (ha, they all say that right) and I'm more concerned with things like having neutrals everywhere and having cat69 ran everywhere than having 500 alexas (I have an alexa and an ecobee now, and can't figure out how to not have both turn on so I just disabled the ecobee one, which sucks because now thats one elss alexa thing)

Anyways, just mentioning that - I'm not going to pimp the house out with smart crap, just wanted to get some thoughts from like minded folks on what they think was actually worth their time - knowing I don't want to make home automation my second job.  I am going to make copious use of motion lights though",beerdwolf,/r/homeautomation/comments/deusyz/value_of_smart_home_in_2019_new_home_build/,51,homeautomation,50

  So I have had a Nest thermostat and cam for many years. I have upgraded the thermostat through local energy company campaigns, and still love it.  However, with Google's decision to abandon the Works with Nest program, I am thinking it is time to step away from Nest products. 

So, I would like to ask for some suggestions. 

I am more than likely going Ecobee 3 lite for my thermostat, but am open to suggestions. 

My nestcam will be replaced possibly with an Arlo system so I can have a cam on my balcony and another in my garage. I say Arlo because my friend uses it. Any alternatives?  I don't like cameras inside my home, but would like to have something that will trigger the camera if my smartthings multi-p sensor detects vibration of my door/window during Night mode. 

Was planning on upgrading smoke detectors to Nest Protects, but now need an alternative. Would really like it to be able to turn on my Hues in a fire or smoke event. Also, I live alone so if it could alert me to an event via mobile, that would be helpful. 

Would also like all these to connect up to Google Assistant and Smartthings, with some IFTTT if not totally compatible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last bit, I may eventually place a Raspberry Pi ""Tablet"" next to my bed to control everything using Smarttools or ActionTiles. Would like the cameras to be able to connect up for a live feed.

Maybe I'm understanding things wrong but it seems like the way Alexa handles devices and groups is incredibly stupid.  They take it like 99% of the way there and then just fail.


I currently have 2 rooms that are set up in the Alexa App as Groups and have individual Echo Dots assigned to them.  Each room has a ceiling fan with a Z-Wave light dimmer switch and a Z-Wave Fan Controller (HomeSeer HS-WD200+ and HomeSeer HS-FC200+) both are controlled via HomeSeer.  Alexa Discovers Downstairs Living Room Fan Light, Downstairs Living Room Fan Alexa, Downstairs Office Fan Light, and Downstairs Office Fan Alexa.  I've placed the devices into their groups and then renamed the Office devices to ""Light"" and ""Fan"" and renamed the Living Room devices to ""Fan Light"" and ""Fan"".


My thought process was that Alexa knows which room I am in and so she should be smart enough to know the difference between 2 different devices named Fan because of the Echo Dot being associated to the same group as the fan that I am trying to control.  Is that wrong?


I can't use the whole ""turn on the light"" thing because Alexa would then turn on the lights and the fans.  Alexa doesn't support anything other than lights and plugs so I've had to set up the fans to act as dimmable lights.  I can say ""Alexa set the Fan to 1"" and she turns the fan on low speed.

Specifically, I enjoy the wake up light and the ability to take it with me in the middle of the night. I have a baby on the way and being able to take an adjustable light on trips to check in without waking up the whole house seems great.

dfktco,1570644154,A Different Take on Robotic Vacuum Reviews (The Hook Up),"Hey All, in my latest video I did an in depth comparison of 4 different robotic vacuums:  Ecovacs Deebot 900 ($250), Ecovacs OZMO 950 ($800), Xiaomi Roborock S50 ($500) and Zemismart Tuya LDS ($300).  I replicated a few of the tests that Vacuum Wars typically does (Suction, Deep Cleaning and Battery Life) as well as a few different aspects like how well they deal with thresholds, thick carpet, and loose rugs.

Here’s my spreadsheets from the video: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_8REE98e_EyCG1Q5Zu1Z1RCFlm-dXngPNNL_tMPsjW4/edit?usp=sharing

Here’s the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOd4gBszLXI

Here are a few more thoughts and observations that I didn’t put in the video:

1. (My Recommendation Overall)  Ecovacs Deebot 900: This is my daily driver vacuum for my first floor that I’ve been using for a little over 6 months.  During that time it has failed to finish twice: Once it got stuck by getting a wheel caught in the track of my sliding glass door, and once it got stuck under a chair in my dining room that was angled differently than normal.  It uses the same great ecovacs app that the OZMO 950 uses with slightly less features (no mopping, no multiple floor mapping).  My suction numbers were significantly higher than the values from Vacuum Wars, and were only slightly lower than the OZMO 950.  It’s possible that ecovacs updated the firmware between my video and his to allow the motor to run at a higher power.  The battery is about 1/3 of the OZMO 950, which is the biggest drawback of this thing, still, it is able to clean my downstairs in a single charge (about 1000 empty sq ft and ~620 sq ft of actually cleanable surface).

2. (My recommendation if money is no object) Ecovacs OZMO 950: This vacuum has all the latest technology, and all the best parts.  It has the best suction, battery life, navigation, object detection, object avoidance, mopping… blah blah blah, it’s the best, but it costs $800.  I tried to get this thing stuck by leaving a bunch of crap on the floor, it just doesn’t get stuck.  It hopped up and down the ¾” threshold like it wasn’t even there.  It’s also the only vacuum I’ve seen that the mopping actually uses a pump to dispense the water instead of just having the water drip out via gravity. If this vacuum had a self emptying bin it would be perfect.  

3. (My recommendation for the tinkerer) Xiaomi Roborock S50: I picked this vacuum because of the Vacuum Wars assessment that it was about the same as the S6, but for less money, and also that the S4 and S6 are not able to be rooted.  I pulled the token on it to integrate into HA, but I haven’t installed valetudo yet.  I’m worried that I might have screwed myself over because I did update to the latest firmware for my tests (I thought it was only fair to do so), but I see that that firmware causes issues with Valetudo.  In my tests the S50 was really good and had moderately high battery life, decent suction, decent deep clean and good navigation.  If the Deebot 900 didn’t exist it would be my overall pick, but as I said in the video, it’s twice the price and only around 10% better than the Deebot 900.  One thing that I really dislike about the S50 is that the air filter is in the back of the bin so you have to reach your fingers all the way through the bin to clear the dust that gets lodged to the dust screen… it’s a minor gripe, but worth noting.

4. (The vacuum I was most curious about) Zemismart Tuya LDS: My experience with Zemismart products has been really good in the past and generally they are able to replicate functionality at significantly lower costs.  The vacuum FEELS like it is going to be great, it’s heavy and doesn’t rattle or feel cheap… but something is half-baked about this vacuum.  The suction is decent, the mapping is good, it has the best bin and filter design by far (big, easy to clean), but the software and cleaning algorithm are messed up.  Not only does the vacuum move very slowly and pause randomly to think about stuff, but it managed to fall down my stairs.  I’ve never seen a vacuum fall down the stairs before.  Now, to it’s credit it managed to make a large dent in my wall and started right back up afterwards, so I guess that means the build quality is good, but advanced vacuums like this shouldn’t be falling down the stairs.  The vacuum has also complained multiple times that it’s side brushes are jammed, when they aren’t jammed at all.  This vacuum would be really great if it had the software and cleaning algorithms to back it up, but it doesn’t.  I think that’s the biggest advantage of the cheap deebot 900, they get the same cleaning algorithms and the expensive bots in a cheaper hardware package.

Full disclosure: I purchased the Deebot 900 and the Roborock S50 out of pocket and the OZMO 950 and Tuya LDS were sent to me for a review.  I’m not a shill, and I never have been.  Me paying for a product or not doesn’t change my opinions or tests.

dfmjin,1570651476,Invoke Siri from the command line,"For a recent personal project, I needed to invoke Siri from the macOS command line. It's part of a home automation thing, and I wanted my computer to invoke Siri on it's own. Here's how I did it.

Step one: Enable ""Type to Siri"" (System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Siri). I also changed Siri's keyboard shortcut to ""Press Fn (Function) Space"" (System Preferences &gt; Siri). The other keyboard shortcut options require you to ""Hold"" a key, which can be done, but it makes things a bit trickier.

Step two: install [Cliclick](https://www.bluem.net/en/projects/cliclick/). Cliclick is a great (and free) tool for triggering mouse and keyboard events via the command line.

With that done, I can invoke Siri from the command line with something like this:

`$ cliclick kd:fn kp:space ku:fn w:250 t:""turn on the living room lights"" kp:return`

Going a step further, if you are familiar with [terminal aliases and functions](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/beginners-guide-to-terminal-aliases-and-functions), you can create a ""siricli"" function:

    siricli(){
    
        cliclick kd:fn kp:space ku:fn w:250 t:""$1"" kp:return
    
    }

Open a new terminal window after adding that function, and now you can invoke Siri like this:

dfsffr,1570679386,"Bought a house, want to make it smart, convenient and fun; but concerned about privacy and complexity and need some help deciding ... please help?","Hi everyone, I promise I've done some research before posting but I haven't found the concrete answers that I was hoping to without posting so here goes: We just bought a house in Florida and I've always wanted a smart home since I was a kid (I'm 38) but I've had serious concerns about Alexa and Google devices regarding privacy so I avoided the whole idea. Well, the home we bought has a wifi connected garage door opener. I thought, ""who needs that?"" laughed and went on with my life. Then I installed the app and damn if it isnt convenient when I'm outside and dont have a garage door opener to just pop the app up and open the door. So then we needed to clean our house and I decided to get a robot vac. Neato D7. I absolutely love it. Now I have an iRobot M6 mop. I'm sold. I want the whole universe of connected things, automated tasks, and simplified life. But I am still concerned about privacy. 

Here is the future I'd like to have at home:

1. Smart lock on front door that is easily locked/unlocked by geofencing or non-key interaction (I'd like a key as a backup but i can put a 9v battery in each vehicle as a backup)
2. Smart light dimmers that can keep the light inside the house the same value all day (using dimmers) so the transition to night is compensated with raising the light levels inside. 
3. Maybe automated shade opening and closing
4. Voice macros to control our media (I have a Logitec harmony remote that is a tad buggy and would like to upgrade to something easier for my whole family to use)
5. Scheduled events that turn on lights outside and inside etc. 
6. So far it seems like we keep our AC locked at 73 and that makes us comfortable all day and night, and I'm  under the impression that if we left for the day and raised the temp then brought it back down that it'd cost as much if not more to bring it back to 73 but if we can save any money with a smart thermostat we definitely are interested. 
7. My kids are home schooled and we're always looking up facts. Being able to just ask  a question out loud and have it accurately answered is cool (and scary because of my privacy concerns)
8. I like the idea of being able to put sensors all over the place and know if a vibration sensor went off (knock at door), door opened, dishwasher or washing machine sprung a leak, etc, can send an alert to my phone. 
9. I have an enclosed inground pool and we like to go out there and listen to music and I think I'm going to put a tv outo there. Being able to control everything with voice so we dont have to get out of the pool, dry off our hands and interact with electronics is an awesome prospect. 
10. I like that I can remotely check my phone and confirm that the house is locked, the alarm is on, etc. 

I can go on and on. I think most of this is common stuff but I wanted to tell you what I'm hoping to get out of this. I am starting from scratch. Part of me thinks the wars over and privacy is dead. I'm trading my valuable analytical data for convenience and that's just how things are. I already have most of this captured by the phone that's always on or near me. So the upgrade to full home convenience is just a short hop away. 

So, is there any hub that protects privacy more than the other? Is it worth the trade off? My research makes it seem like Alexa is much easier to interact with and control macro commands but Google is smarter and, when it works, is much better. Smartthings seems to get good reviews but its very limited vs Alexa and Google. I am a bit lost on where to start and whether I even should. I know it's kind of lame to post this kind of ""please help me with every decision of my life"" kind of question but hopefully you see where I'm coming from.

I have a hard time getting an overview of the market and understanding what I should look for.

&amp;#x200B;

I picture the actual monitoring would be reasonably straight forward - the place has single phase electricity (230V, this is Europe) and a Gallus G4 gas meter. I assume that I want to use one of these clamp devices around the incoming power line, and some sort of reed sensor on the gas meter to count pulses, and whatever-available temperature and humidity probes. I am comfortable installing and configuring stuff in general, won't need any help there. However what I'd be happy to get would be some device, probably either Pi or ESP8266 based, that would pull the sensor data in, connect to the wifi, and deliver it, ideally via MQTT or similar to a recipient of my choice. I have low tolerance for cloud solutions with specialized apps delivering aggregate data only ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't require absolute live data, but a data point every few minutes would be nice. The device should be somewhat rugged and stable, I can't get there every two months to switch batteries or SD cards, since it is 2000km away. Obviously things need to self-restart after a power loss and should fail gracefully.

So i just started to dive head first into the smart home game.  I was just curious if people had some quick tips after going thru the growing pains and having a few learning experiences.

Currently I have Sonos, Hue lighting in my Living Room and Bedroom, and a Nest Thermostat.  Pretty basic I know, but as I've been adding more pieces, I find that it's started to become a bit over complex, using 3 different apps to run these different things, and I'd like to start controlling all of these from one central ""home base"" app.  

I've seen Brilliant and that kinda looks like what I'm looking for, but I was curious if there was something like this that's purely in app form, that I could run from an iPad or other tablet.  It just seems like there are so many different available options that it's gotten confusing to find which is the best route to go and what I'd need to add to my current system.

I basically just want simple functionality, and the aspect I'm struggling with the most is setting up automations for the separate rooms given different scenarios, such as leaving / returning home, etc.  Also having an easy layout to toggle different presets for the lights all in one place.

Really appreciate the help everyone!  I hate to be the newbie and sorry if I'm being annoying in this Sub, but any help / guidance toward old helpful threads would be so useful for me.

Two questions for you guys. 

1) At the office we are using Z-Wave and OpenHAB to create our own home brew automation solution. For reasons unknown to us, our Z-Wave network seems incredibly unreliable. Sometimes nodes just stop communicating. Restarting OpenHab sometimes has an affect, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes after waiting a few hours a node will pop back in on the network. We can't figure it out, but its so unreliable its basically unusable. Does anyone have any ideas of things I should check?

2) We've been looking for a good solution for a mortise storefront style lock that we can access through some IoT protocol. Ideally NOT Z-Wave since our experience with Z-Wave has been so poor as of late. Im not sure what brands are better/worse, but the closest I can find to what we're looking for is from Samsung. Something like the SHP-DR708 is what we want, but Im not sure how I can programmatically access the lock functions. If I throw a button up on OpenHab I dont really need to read the state back from the lock, I just need to be able to lock/unlock it. Is there an API described somewhere that Im missing that I can hit? What are other people doing for push/pull locks for integration with their other devices and programmatic control?

Currently I have a couple of lamps that I can just manually turn on and off. Now the problem is that I don't know a way to have both options. For example if I have smart bulbs in the lamps, if I manually turned the lamp off the last time I was using it, I have to manually turn it on. The manual would not only control the light, but also the ability to use smart features at all. Smart plugs have a similar problem, just reversed.

dggr6u,1570807607,Total replacement suggestions for Nest ecosystem,"Greetings!

&amp;#x200B;

I am a long-time user of Nest products, starting with an original v1 thermostat.  Since then I've adopted many thermostats, Protect smoke detectors, and Hello doorbells across a number of properties.  I used to really enjoy the central control of all of these items from one place, as well as my ability to tie in various things to it (my own custom code, Homeseer, ifttt, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

However since Google took over and the ""Works with Nest"" functionality was taken away for \*new\* setups, I became wary.  Most of my stuff continued to work, however as time has gone by here and there the pieces are starting to fall apart (Homeseer plugin stopped working, can't re-auth, ifttt link stopped working yesterday, I expect this trend to continue).

&amp;#x200B;

I have reached the point where I have decided its time to jump ship and find a new solution to cover all of these parts of my home automation.  I am looking for a good suggestion for Thermostats, Doorbells, and Smoke Detectors that all have relatively open API's and ability to integrate with other systems easily.  I've found a number of thermostats of course and have been pouring through review blogs and such.  Smoke detectors seem far less prevalent in the home automation world though.  Doorbells are pretty straightforward, I guess 'Ring' is the next best thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I do appreciate how all of these things fell under a single 'umbrella' manufacturer, and would love to find another company that makes all 3 devices, but I'm pretty sure nobody else has home automation friendly versions of all 3 product types, but I'm sure some out there do 2 of 3 (thermostats and smoke detectors or something like that).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sad to bounce from Nest, but Google pretty much ruined it for my use case, so would love to hear what others have done and/or are doing that are in similar shoes.

Connection and reliability seem to be solid, even in combination with homebridge for apple compatibilty. 

Most of the devices at home are “dumb” which we need to make smarter. The receiver in this case is a onkyo tx-sr313. Which is dumb and can be controlled with IR. Which means it can be controlled by and arduino with IR blaster. I would like to switch modes on this receiver with simple IR signals. This can be done in two ways; 1 use a sequence of IR signals or 1 signal to initiate a pre-grogrammed mode on the receiver.

Long sequences of volume/down and channel switching seem unreliable. Therefore i would to use basic preprogrammed commands on the receiver such as; apple tv mode (volume 20, channel hdmi, surround cinema) and gaming (volume 35, channel optical, surround dolby). Controlled by one signal. I am not sure how this can be done.

dgj4fj,1570818195,Lutron Caseta smart dimmer scheduled slow fade in/morning wake-up?,"New to smart home/automation, but I recently moved into a place with some smart lighting. In particular, I'm looking at my bedroom which has an in-wall smart dimmer switch. I also have the Caseta Smart Bridge set up.

I'm looking for a way to have my light slowly brighten in the morning, i.e. over the course of let's say 20-30 minutes. This doesn't seem possible using the Lutron app, short of creating a ton of staggered scheduled events incrementally increasing the brightness. I'd prefer to avoid this for the sake of ease of enabling/disabling the entire scheduled fade-in.

Is there any better way to do this? Would I have to buy some other smart home hub device? Is it possible to do with free software tools, e.g. homeassistant?

Is there any other sub I should also try asking this on?

Thanks

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone, I'm going to try using Home Assistant. Forgot I already have a Pi Zero that I use for Pi Hole that I can load HA on.

I'm pretty sick of heating up the entire house when we have different needs in the morning, evening and night time - hence the interest in automating the house with thermostat zones.

Does anyone have Smart TRV / eTRV in the UK and experience with a smart hub as well, e.g. Drayton, Nest, Tado or Netatmo?

Findings so far:

* Nest:
   * only works with energenie - can't find any solid reviews about this and the few I've found are mixed. It's the only eTRV 
* Tado :
   * subscription for built in geofencing, which is total ass
   * Does not have IFTTT. However I believe the V3 (older app/interface) has it all for free? Most people say this is the one to go for, despite the subscription model for V3+. 
   * I don't need air quality and window detection.
* Drayton :
   * Could be very viable, as it has IFTTT for geofencing.
   * Everything looks basic like a bucket meal
* Netatmo:
   * TRVs seem nice, it has IFTTT for geofencing.

I have these outside front lights (bunch of pot lights, and fixtures) all controlled by one smart light switch inside the front door (using Lutron Caseta ; i do have a neutral wire btw, in case that gives me better options)

I also have the Nest Hello doorbell, in an IDEAL world I could’ve used IFTT to turn the lights on when ‘Nest Cam’ detects motion, but of course since August that is not possible anymore, even though I didn’t migrate my account to a google account, I was stupid and forgot to connect it (although I did connect Nest Thermostat, and Nest Protect.........)

Anyways what’s my best course of action for my current set up. I do have a Wyze Cam in the garage which I tested out with IFTT for fun, I was able to get the lights to turn on when the Wyze cam detected motion, but the issue is they don’t turn back off, and it goes off anytime of day, even during morning/afternoon. I read about the new Wyze Motion sensors, i did see in IFTT they have a ‘when motion detected’ and when motion clears’ option, so maybe could get them to turn off the lights when its clear (does IFTT check this condition every 30 minutes?), but again not sure if can do this just at night.

Right now I am using the Alexa app to manage routines and such for most of my items, but I’ve noticed that the capabilities are a bit limited. My question is, does it make sense to switch to Google home? Or is there something better to control all of this? Again, I’m not looking to go crazy with automation here, but I may want to add some things down the road and want to make sure I can get the most out of it.

dhfill,1570996169,Looking for smart thermostat recommendations (2xAC zone with 1xBoiler in old home),"Current setup:

\- Older, two floor home  
\- Two AC units zones, thermostat on each floor (each of these have standard wiring with a C-wire) (G, C, Y, RC, and unused W)  
\- One boiler for heating the entire home with radiators, this is driven by a single (separate) thermostat on floor 1, so there are 3 thermostats in the home currently. The thermostat driving the boiler is battery powered with two wires only (RH and W)

My goals:

I'd like one thermostat downstairs that controls entire home heat as well as AC on first floor. I would like a smart thermostat that is either Wifi or Z-wave enabled (currently have smartthings). It would not be hard for me to run the two wires from the heating thermostat to the same location as the floor 1 cooling thermostat. However, I would like the option to have remote sensors, especially for heat given the heating for the entire home is essentially single zone. The upstairs thermostat I'd also like either Wifi or z-wave.

I’ve read most of the posts on here, but questions I still have are.

A.  Immediacy of response for Phyn. (Could link phyn plus through IFTT with an actual homeseer sensor around devices I’m particularly worried about if Phyn is slow)


B. Reliability and long term support of products. Who is or isn’t likely to be around in 5+ years when I need technical support?


C. I have hard water, is that going to be a problem for units besides the Econet that is manipulating the valve itself? Or is having an open close automation in the middle of the night occasionally enough to handle that? Or in their ability to detect data?


D. Homeseer. Someone mentioned on here that in the event it brakes in the closed position it might not be possible to manually open it? Any truth to that?


E. Any advantages to invidiual sensors with a econet or homeseer over a Phyn?

G. Any reason to (or not) just get the regular Phyn and pair it with another whole house shut off valve? Besides saving money?

dhkhdv,1571021173,home automation on separate network," 

All,

Hoping  to get some help. I  am diving into home automation but want to keep it  separate from my  default network per recommendation on a post I read  on one of the subreddit.  My current environment as follows.

LAN/Wifi network 192.168.1.x

Default gateway is [192.168.1.2](https://192.168.1.2/) (UTM box)

UTM is ipfire box box on [192.168.1.2](https://192.168.1.2/)  This serves as my firewall,dns, and dhcp server.

I just bout a cisco 3560 to support the POE.

Cisco  switch is configured with default vlan 1 and vlan 20 (192.168.20.X) for  home automation. Though not important but I would like to have a DHCP  server on this network as well.

I  can not route to the outside from my home automation network (vlan 20)  and can not get from my default vlan to the home automation network  (vlan 20). Everything on the default is working as normally  I can route  out and reach resources form the outside in via firewall. Below is the  ip route from Cisco switch.

ip route form my switch:

C    [192.168.20.0/24](https://192.168.20.0/24) is directly connected, Vlan20

C    [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24) is directly connected, Vlan1

What configuration do I need to modify/add on the Cisco witch?

I would like to be able to use that switch to control my lamps without running extension cord(s) to the other side of the room.

From what I have been reading, it seems something like a zwave or zigbee smart switch with some smart plugs or smart outlets might work.  The switch would be wired up to control the existing switched outlet, but nothing would be plugged into it.  It would have to wirelessly control the smart plugs or smart outlets that my lamps would plug into.  I haven't been able to find many details about how these things can be paired up wirelessly, if that's even possible.  Maybe there's a simpler way to do this?

di2a6b,1571111774,Ikea bulbs and remotes buttons - works even when gateway dies,"I brought a couple of Ikea Tradfri branded zigbee remotes and bulbs.  To my surprise, I can pair both the remotes and the bulbs to my zigbee2mqtt setup, as well as have the remotes directly control the light bulb without gateway intervention (zigbee direct?).  This is great.

It means even if the gateway go down, lighting control is still possible.  The bulbs retain the last brightness setting, so it's potentially problematic if it's left in a dim state and you can't brighten it because the gateway is down.  This zigbee direct feature solves that problem.

The Ikea remotes aren't that much more expensive than Xiaomi/Aqara zigbee buttons.  Actually, they're a bit cheaper when you buy the bundle considering the cost of the bulb.  The Ikea remotes are also more functional.

To clarify, both the bulbs and remotes are paired to the gateway.  I can change the bulb state from both the gateway or the remote.  I also see the remote being operated (button presses or rotations).  Since the remotes are directly operating the lights, I don't really need to setup any automation to respond to the remote.  But I can turn off the bulbs via automation (i.e. from PIR sensors showing room is empty).  There might be some creative things in the future, like orchestrate other non-zigbee devices in conjunction with remote buttons being used on the light.

**Edit:**

**After a couple of days, I've noticed that the button's interaction with the zigbee network seems to stop working if the light bulb is turned off at the switch.  I'm not 100% sure yet if that's indeed the cause, but it seems to be.  If the bulb is left on all the time, it seems the remote consistently gives feedback at the hub.**

I want to have in-ceiling speakers for music on the first floor; however, it's important to my wife to be able to yell at the music the same way she can yell at me, so we need to be able to communicate with the smart device from each room. I'm well-versed in traditional A/V for movie watching, but this is all new to me... 

Currently, we have separate Alexa devices in two different rooms, but the layout of the new house won't work well for trying to play music from one room and listen in another. Plus, I don't want extra devices sitting on shelves/counters.

So, my questions....

1. What is the best way to connect Alexa, Apple, etc.? Should it be a central hub with an audio receiver?
2. Can I get 2-way speakers with a mic that ""talk"" to the smart device or is there a better way to approach this?
3. Speaker recommendations? Looking for middle tier right now. Not budget but not super crazy either?
4. Do I need A/B zones to control rooms or can I go with audio dimmer switches in each room?
5. What am I forgetting? Seems like a lot to think about.

I have some z wave switches and a smartthings hub. I'm planning on switching to Home Assistant (with Zwave/Zigbee usb stick) in the nebulous future, but I'm finding smartthings an easy start.

I went with Z wave switches because I wanted motion sensing dimmer switches, which only exist in Z wave. However, it looks like zigbee smart plugs and sensors and button/remotes are cheaper, so I'm considering getting those instead of the Z wave variants. 

I know running both results in a weaker mesh network, however, my house is on the small side (1600sqft townhouse), so I don't expect a weaker mesh network to matter much. 

And both the Smartthings hub and whatever I might run HA on will have both zigbee and zwave radios, so theoretically there shouldn't be much of an issue with communicating between the two networks?

I know that some zigbee devices have compatibility issues (notably the Xiaomi aquara ones?), but I'm assuming that I can just return any that have those issues and grab ones that don't have those issues.

I'm not particularly concerned with 2.4GhZ saturation unless it interferes with the reliability of my Zigbee devices, my 5ghz wifi reaches the entire house.

AFAIK those are the points against adding Zigbee devices, but they don't seem to affect my situation much.

dik1m7,1571199791,Does this Zigbee dimmer switch exist? Looking for no neutral and standard plate.,"I'm looking to replace a couple of dimmer switches with Zigbee capable ones, but what I'm looking for doesn't appear to exist.

* Must not require a neutral wire.
* Must speak Zigbee.
* Must fit in a [standard switch plate](https://i.imgur.com/KRrsCHB.jpg) (i.e. not Decora or rocker style)

My house is really old, which is cool for all the vintage stuff, but sucks for wiring. None of the switches here have a neutral in the box. And all the switch plates that I'd like to keep seem to conflict with the ""sleek and modern"" look of most smart dimmers.

I don't mind having to replace a battery if that's what's required to run the switch on just a hot leg. I'll also consider Z-Wave if I need to, but would rather stick with my current Zigbee setup if possible. 

Anything out there fit these criteria? If not, what have y'all done to update a dimmer switch without it sticking out like a phaser gun in an old western movie? 

The fixtures controlled by these dimmers have exposed candelabra bulbs that I'd rather not replace. Most of the other lights in my house are now Hue or similar Zigbee bulbs, but in these two spots, using a central dimmer would make more sense.

****

EDIT: [This switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077VCKFKW/ref=psdc_6291359011_t4_B06XV25Z5R) gets really close, but since it trickles a bit of current through the line/load terminals, I don't think I can use it with my LED bulbs.

I have no home automation right now, so I have a blank slate, but I also need to make sure I go into the right ecosystem.

First concern, is that the ring peephole camera is not in the August family, so maybe thats not a good choice?

Second concern is whether I can use the same key as backup for all locks (front and back). That should be fine with August and Yale correct?

Third, do I need a keypad for the front door? Can I hold off on that or does that need to be decided now? I would just use my proximity cell phone to open. And my family can use a key. But maybe it is better just to go keypad from the beginning?

diy1gz,1571269807,[HELP] 12v Smart Switch (latching),"Hey guys, I’m new to this group. Hope I can find some answers here. 

*What I want to accomplish:*

I have an old PC power supply and I’m using it to power LED strips, fans in my cupboard, among other things. I have the two cables cut on the PSU and know how to get it to run without a motherboard. As long as the two wires are touching, the PSU stays on (Hence I need a latching switch). 

I want to be able to turn the power supply on and off using a smart hub. I am creating my own remote using thehomeremote.com and I still need to buy a hub (advice on that is welcome too). I would prefer to use ZigBee or Z wave. RF is fine too, but I’ve been having trouble getting my Sonoff 433 Bridge to work (wont even link to the app through wifi). Might give up on Sonoff. 

(I will most likely not be using alexa etc because I prefer privacy. I’ll be using a tablet with thehomeremote.com as an alternative to control everything from one tablet). 

I hope you guys will be able to help me out and send me in the right direction. I believe I am able minded and have the will power to get this to work, but If you do give me instructions - please dumb them down so that I am able to learn. 

Once I get it working, I’ll post the end result. I will also create a step by step guide and give credit to those that help me.

My name is Amanda and I am a computer science major at Winthrop University. I am in a research course this semester, in which I am focusing on user concerns over the privacy and security controls of their smart home devices. I am conducting over the phone interviews to find out more about smart home users concerns and unmet expectations, so that I can publish a paper informing smart home companies, like Ring and August, how they can improve their devices. While this post is not a question, I care about the questions you have been posting and struggling with in this forum because they will guide my results and help me to better inform smart home companies on what to improve.  
Anyone who is at least 18 years old, speaks English, and owns a smart doorbell or a smart lock of any brand is eligible. Your participation and input can really help me move forward in my research. The interview will be on average 20 minutes long on google voice or any medium convenient to you. I am offering a $5 Amazon gift card, through my partners at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, as a token of my appreciation for your time.

dj8vzx,1571330056,Smart Oil Gauge hack,"&amp;#x200B;

[I love my Smart Oil Gauge, but the 3.6 volt AA batteries suck, and they're not cheap. The first two that I got with the gauge lasted four months, but the next two sets didn't even last two weeks, and the last set died after ten days. I finally got this variable output DC adapter from Amazon. I checked the adapter tip for polarity and voltage with my multimeter, then last night clipped the wires from the battery box, and hooked up the adapter using alligator clips \(I wrapped electrical tape over them to prevent a short circuit\). The adapter is set at 6.98 volts right now \(I checked the actual voltage to make sure that it didn't go over 7.2 volts\). I crossed my fingers, and plugged the adapter into the power strip. It worked like a charm! At this voltage setting, the app shows the battery strength as excellent. This adapter came with a number of different tips, so if I can find an appropriate size tip and plug, I'll drill a hole in the top of the gauge cover and epoxy the plug in. I may try to find a cheap 7.2 volt rechargeable cordless tool battery pack, then modify it so I can run power to the gauge in the same fashion, just because I'm a little leary of having something plugged into the wall and connected to my oil tank \(probably unwarranted, seeing as how the furnace is directly connected to AC power\).](https://preview.redd.it/p01p6skoj4t31.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8605bfb26cf186353d2ad99fabbecea8cec831b8)",rudedog4,/r/homeautomation/comments/dj8vzx/smart_oil_gauge_hack/,20,homeautomation,15

Obviously, this is a giant pain in my butt to handle, and I'd like to simplify things and unify some of these controls.

While simply upgrading everything to a basic programmable thermostat is an option, I'm looking to see if I can bring the whole system into the 21st century with a nice, unified system, which will both let me control everything from one spot (be it an app or a really nice UI on a ""nicer"" model somewhere in the house) and that will let me use some remote sensors for rooms without a thermostat in them to keep bedrooms at the appropriate temperature. Has anyone got any recommendations that would help me accomplish this?

I'm open to pretty much anything, though I expect I would disable any learning algorithms (we're not the sorts to keep a steady schedule enough to benefit) and any voice activated capabilities (just not really my style- plus I'd rather not have my toddler start messing with settings!).",PM_ME_YOUR_RATTIES,/r/homeautomation/comments/djcn36/best_smart_thermostat_for_multiple_zone_home/,2,homeautomation,3

I'll be moving soon and I've been considering getting some compatible smarthome products, unfortunately I have yet to figure out what makes the most sense for me.

I'm trying to keep the price reasonable, and I'd want to make sure all the devices work with Apple Home Kit as I am heavily invested into the Apple ecosystem at the moment. I live in the EU so it might not be possible to get specific products which are available in the US.

Currently I am looking for suggestions for the following.

1. Lightbulbs - dimmable (or lightswitches if that makes more sense?)
2. Robot vacuum
3. Smart speakers (preferably compatible with Sonos as I have a Play 1)

I have tried looking for some options myself and have found the following solutions.

Xiaomi Mi Home 

Ikea Trådløs

Some smart HA folks have then used these things to create a “lighting control cube” which changes the lighting based on the position of the sensor embedded into a wooden cube:  https://community.smartthings.com/t/a-wooden-cube-that-controls-lighting/17493

My use case ... is not for cool lighting.  It’s personal, and medical.  I suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, and therefore I have to sleep every night with a machine (CPAP) that helps me breathe.  That machine generates data that I can look at to see if/when I experience obstructions.

Often, obstructions might occur in clusters - which would be somewhat indicative a positional factors influencing the apnea (it’s more likely to happen when you are sleeping on your back).  However, short of setting up a webcam and reviewing video ... I have no real way to know how I’m sleeping (back, stomach, side) at any given moment of the night.

That’s what made me thing of the SmartThings lighting cube.  I could potentially use one of those sensors and just clip it to my pajama top somehow.  But SmartThings doesn’t seem to be the best platform for working with the raw data for a case like this, so I was wondering if there were other sensors out there that did similar things?

I am trying to figure out the best way to add some smart control to my home's heating system this winter. We have an oil boiler/baseboard system with three zones. Zone 1 also includes the entire basement which isn't in the diagram. From what I've researched, my only option to have every zone be smart controlled would be to replace every thermostat with a smart thermostat. If this is accurate, I'm not so sure the cost would be worth it.

In Zone 3 we have the gas fireplace that has its own basic thermostat to figure out when it needs to ignite during the winter. The fireplace supplements the great room since the thermostat for that zone is in our bedroom and we like to keep that cooler. I've got the fan for the fireplace blower connected to a smart plug. So I command Alexa to turn it on when the fireplace ignites. I'd love to have as basic of a smart thermostat as possible on the fireplace so I can have the fan automatically kick on when the burner ignites and also not have to worry about manually turning that thermostat on and off in the morning and at night. If I do nothing else, I'd like to have this.

Do I have any options for controlling all of the zones besides purchasing four smart thermostats?

I will inherit his home, a three bed two bath with an attached apartment consisting of another one bed one bath and a two car garage. I live in the NYC metro and his house is about 6 hours away in a rural area. He has two vehicles and common household belongings there. I will be selling the house, contents and cars but won’t be able to do so until at least the spring due to his estate.
I’m looking for recommendations for reasonable security to add to the property that will be left unattended through the winter except for sporadic visits. He has some sort of DSL internet that I’m not sure of as far as speed. There are no local police (state police cover the area) so I’m hoping to be able to monitor any unexpected access, water leaks (it gets very cold in the winter and a frozen pipe would be a disaster). I also don’t want to spend a fortune on this as I’m not keeping the house. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

dkh8gp,1571562295,"Choice for simple smart apartment - no doors, just plugs and lights","Hey there!


INCOMING BLABLA, JUST SKIP TO THE QUESTIONS IF YOU WANT TO :)


I just recently was given an echo 2 from my parents to test it out and was really happy with it!
I could use it to play me sounds to sleep, wake me up without getting my phone and set an alarm 
, and I really play music more often because I don't have to connect my phone to any bluetooth speaker. I just love how you use it regularly ,because it's just so convenient.
So I want to set up my apartment with some smart stuff that will not be outdated in like two years. Also I don't want to have a lot of stuff, I want to have it combined.

I am by no means an audiophile, the echo 2 has a quality that is really good for my ears, so I though t I just buy the exact same one on black Friday- or even used. I noticed that the echo 3 will be released, so I wanted to go with this one. 
Then I realised there is only a hub integrated in 
The echo 2 plus. Also I don't know if Alexa, google assistant or anything will suit me more(I have a Samsung phone and thinking about getting a galaxy watch active 2 in the next half of a year- so probably Bixby:/)

Question #1 : which speaker, which hub, or a speaker with integrated hub? (With hindsight to the next two questions)

I really don't need anything for doors and windows (yet!) and will probably not use it to heat my room, make coffee or anything else, but to keep the possibility to use some things, I wanted to get two or three smart outlets

Question #2: which outlet will be sufficient? Is there any outlet with more than just 'on and off'. Any recommendations?

One of the most important things for me is the matter of waking up and going to sleep. 
I want to setup a skill (on alexa) or anything else if I go for google assistant. I want to let it start play music very silently and wake me up getting louder while increasing the brightness of my home/color of my home. 

Question #3:
There are dimmable smart bulbs. Which would you recommend? Also: there are 'normal' bulbs that are dimmable depending on how often you turn them on. I could probably write a skill that will use an outlet for this. Is this an perspective? Also: I don't ~really~ (kinda want to tho) need any different colors, but perhaps it would be nice to better sleep/wake up depending on the color.

I am willing to spend about 150€ for all of this (used or black friday), or I think about 200-250€ if you are thinking 'new'.

So, hub, speaker, lights, outlets...

Looking for smart wall dimmers for the dumb lights in my new house. There are some options that look fantastic (EcoDim) but are way, wayyyy too pricy.

I need:

* no neutral (old house) 
* small (not much room in my wall boxes) 
* fits into round EU wall boxes
* preferably Zigbee
* affordable

Bonus points if it'll fit within existing frames (like Gira 55) so it integrates smoothly.

So far the Fibaro seems like a good option, but I'm not sure it'll fit behind my switches. Especially if I also need the bypass. I also don't have any other Z-wave devices (though I do have a compatible Homey hub) so I fear the mesh would be poor.

At this point I am leaning towards Apple HomeKit but I am also curious about Amazon Alexa and Google Home. 

Simple question:

What happens if my upstream internet goes offline but my wireless router stays working? 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a hypothetical question because, unlike most homes in America, the home I am trying to build is in a remote location where we receive relatively poor last-mile internet delivery— while the internet does work intermittently, it often slows down to a crawl or is bottlenecked completely \[it is delivered by long-range Wifi and there are no other good options for a wired delivery\]. Normal ping response times on the network are 150ms. When it slows down (which can happen intermittently and unpredictably)  all response times go to about 2000ms+. So you see when I say poor performance or fully offline I really mean it, this is not just a fluke thing. Also this is weather- dependent, and on stormy days we worse performance on the network.

You will note this happens while the power to the building is just fine— meaning my Wifi router continues to work. 

My understanding of both Amazon Alexa and Google Home is that the commands are processed on the cloud, so the upstream internet is necessary for any voice-activated solution to work. 

Is this also true for Apple HomeKit ?

dl6efx,1571689684,Advice Getting Started (esp. Sunrise Clock),"Thanks for looking, and thanks for you help. I read the wiki and did some searching (apologies if I missed some obvious hits), but I need some help getting pointed in the right direction.

Background: (1) I'm savvy enough. I've run a Raspberry Pi as a PiHole for a while (now it's an entertainment system); I've done weird network setups with custom router firmware; I've been using various flavors of Linux for a couple of decades; I use Tasker on my Android for all sorts of little things; etc. (2) Starving grad student, blah, blah, blah, so cost matters a lot.

*What I want* is some advice on an approach to take that would satisfy my current needs, but in such a way that has good potential for expansion in the future, while maintaining minimal cost.

*Immediate need:* a ""sunrise clock"" that lets me set an alarm (preferably with my Android phone) so that a light in my bedroom slowly comes on over 30 minutes or whatever.

*Future ideas:* I'd love to be able to put lights on a timer when I'm on vacation. I'd like to turn on my heater (wall socket, simple on-off would be fine) either remotely (i.e., when headed home from vacation) or by schedule. Starting the coffee pot in the morning would be cool. Security cameras, heating timers for efficiency, doorbell replacement, whole house audio, etc. are possibly cool ideas.

Basically, I'm looking for a pointer in a direction that will give me a sunrise clock that might take a little extra legwork to set up, but would set me up for a maximally flexible and cheap system moving forward.

Thank you!",sipofgreentea,/r/homeautomation/comments/dl6efx/advice_getting_started_esp_sunrise_clock/,1,homeautomation,5
dl6icv,1571690128,z-wave bulbs that work with Caseta dimmer?,"I'm getting the wiring for my bedroom lights replaced, and since I was getting Caseta dimmers in the other bedrooms I had a Caseta dimmer switch put in my master bedroom too.

I don't need to use the Caseta switch to dim the bulbs or even turn them on and off.

The batteries are draining so fast and frequent, that I feel like I barely use it. The app doesn’t notify me when the batteries at about to die, so it could be disconnected for days before we notice (as you can tell, it rarely gets used). My favorite feature is the auto-lock “automation” in the smart things app. I fear that’s what’s draining it so much. I recent turned that off, just to see if I can get more than a few days of life out of the unit. 

Is this what other people experience? That’s one of the best features of this thing, and I’d hate to never get to use it.

dlbvxn,1571714358,Thermostat question: running the fan but not heat/AC,"Hi reddit,

I've got an older house (approx 100 yrs) but luckily someone installed central heat and air along the way. We're also lucky to live in a climate where windows open is often an option. That being said the airflow upstairs (where the master bedroom is) isn't that great. 

We've found that by running the house fan with the windows open we can push enough air around to be comfortable. To do this we set the Nest to ""cool to 85F"" and set the fan circulate 15 minutes every hour. I don't like doing this because if the house gets a little too warm the AC could kick on with the windows open.

I'm a little surprised Nest doesn't support this functionality. If someone knows of a setting I don't that would be a huge help.

There's also plenty of multi-room solutions for streaming music in your house, but they often come at high costs, and in most of the cases they'll require you to replace your existing speakers with expensive Sonos or Bose solutions.

In this article I explain how to bypass these limitations and build your own multi-service and multi-room music setup using a RaspberryPi and open source software, and how to control it using any command-line, web or mobile interface you like, or an infrared remote, or a custom voice assistant.

Yesterday, I received my 2 Mysa units for my garage and basement. Firstly, wow, it was so easy and fast to install and configure!

Again, the unit was installed yesterday night. It's new and I'm trying to find out how it will behave.

I apologize in advance as I am sure there are tons of similar posts. I have tried to search as much as possible but not entirely sure where to begin. 

We just bought our first house, and I'm looking to make it a bit smarter. So far, the only smart devices I have are two nest thermostats.

Next question is what kind of light switches to get. I was looking at Lutron Caseta but it seems you need yet another bridge for those. What switches will work similarly but without the need for another piece of hardware? 

Aside from that, I am pretty open to the rest of the hardware. I will likely get a smart lock, probably garage openers, maybe some other things.

So TLDR; is there any 5Ghz or dual band smart plugs in the UK.

A couple options I've considered (open to other suggestions):

Lutron Caseta or Ra2 Select switches and dimmers are an option and they seem to integrate well with Home Assistant.

Sonoff minis, Shelly units, or similar ESP8266 units flashed with tasmota or esphome in each switch location could be an option as well.

A little off the wall, but found this company called PMMI Lighting (pmmi-lighting.com). It's a low voltage system that is completely wired with Cat-5 or Cat-6. It's a cool concept and I'd recommend checking them out.

If it's possible I would also like to have the ability to turn on the boiler for hotwater/heating with this solution too.

What’s involved: Samsung TV, Chromecast, Google Mini, Dakboard

1. Created a Dakboard account and integrated my google calendar in it. Dak generates a nice URL which displays my weekly agenda. 
2. Add above URL to the Samsung TVs browser as homepage. Full screen mode shows a nice dashboard with clock, weather and agenda. 
3. Set Samsung to launch last opened app when powered on. So when you turn on the TV, you see the full screen dashboard. 
4. Set Samsung to be powered on by any CEC device. Chromecast is powered from separate source and not from the TV. 
5. Add a routine to google home to turn on and  turn off Chromecast at set times. 

What you get: Every morning, at 7 AM the TV turns on automatically and displays the dashboard and powers off after 30 mins. 

Gaps/Issues: The weak link in this setup is step 3. If you were watching Netflix the previous night, you don’t get the dashboard without manual switch.

There is a ramp from their entry around the side of the house and to the driveway. There is only one existing light which is switched but it doesn't give light where its needed and the switch is buried behind where I park and a bunch of crap. I plan to put in 5 flush mount lights in the soffit to remedy this issue. I can't figure out how to give my FIL switching access.

He parks in the garage but there isn't a good place to put a switch to turn on/off the lights.  I also don't have any wires run from the garage to their entry door to complete a double light switch circuit.

Ideas:

\- Replace existing switches for other lights with ""smart switches"" and program toggling (double up for on, double down for off) for the soffit lights.  One in the garage and one right inside their door. Can you program smart switches to work this way?

\- Just put the new lights on a photocell and let the sun take care of this. The conflict is I'd prefer to not leave the lights on all night, not so much for the power consumption (LED) but for the light pollution.  You pass their bedroom window before you get to their door.

\- Motion. I'd need two of them I guess if I went this route because there is a corner you go around.  I've never had anything on motion so I don't know how accurate they are.  On the lower ramp the soffit is probably 15-20 feet above, would that mess with the reliability of the motion sensor?

I'm not sure what the best option would be.  I've dabbled with home automation (SmartThings v2) but haven't set anything up at the new house.  What am I missing here and what have I not considered?  Ease of use for my FIL is the priority with this install.

Or, do I need to replace the switches with smart switches to actually be the drivers, rather than using smart bulbs?

What happens when the bulb turns on, with the switch in off position? I am guessing there is no power and the light would not work. What about vice-versa... when the switch is in on position, and I turn the bulb off?

dmf5y6,1571917198,"Networking with a smart home, need advice"," 

Hey Everyone,

I'm looking for some information about consumer vs enterprise routers. I have a ""smart home"" so there's lots of (mostly 2.4ghz) devices throughout the home, say 20 to 30 devices in total. I've tried consumer grade routers like the AC86U but found I would continually get drop outs on the 2.4ghz band, the 5ghz band had no issues so ended up returning it for credit. I've been told to not go consumer this time and instead head into more enterprise gateways with an indoor access point instead as according to the person I was talking to at the time, I shouldn't have any issues because they're far better quality.  


This lead me looking at the two following gateways below and I have a couple of questions:

1. There's a massive price difference between these two but aside from the different W I'm not sure what the difference is.   


2. With POE, could i plug a normal ethernet cable into that to connect something like a streamlink, phillips hue hub or Fire cube into it or do I need a separate switch for this?  
3. With the 86U I'm assuming it didn't work largely because the smart devices probably weren't enabled for Mu-mimo even if the router is. What are the odds of running into the same issue with the following access point?

The daycare my daughter goes to is trying to upgrade their current webcam system and asked me for advice. They currently have an ancient system of 6 panasonic cameras from 2011 that you can access through your browser with a login and password. They are comically bad, like, best refresh option is every 3 seconds. Actual video would be an upgrade. 

Anyway, they are looking for something you can access via an app on your phone or a browser, that can be viewed concurrently by probably max 100 people (but in reality probably closer to 20), and of course affordable. My initial thought was Wyze cameras but they don't have a browser option and the only way to do it would be to hand out the same username/password to every parent. I don't really mind everyone on the same username (it would be one used just for the school), but this would mean if the school tried to turn off the two-way audio feature, anyone could turn it back on.

dmm168,1571948035,porch motion lights,"Does anyone have a suggestion for how to handle this setup? My house has a light switch inside that controls the porch light and 6 other front lights.

It seems to me the answer is I need a smart motion detector in the front of the house that can trigger the switch turning on. If that's the best way does anyone have a suggestion for a smart, all-weather, battery powered motion detector?

dmq8d5,1571966677,Is this possible? Switch on/off controls separate smart-switch and smart-bulb.,"I'm extremely new to all this smart-home stuff so please forgive me if I'm asking basic questions...

I'm wondering if this scenario is possible:

(A) Smart switch controlling a set of lights.  
(B) Smart switch controlling a different set of lights.  
(C) A smart bulb on a 'dumb' switch.
  
  
And the routine would be...  
1. If I turn ON switch (A) OR (B), it will turn OFF light (C) if it is on.  
2. If both (A) and (B) switch are OFF, then light (C) will turn ON.


If this is possible...what are the best smart-switches/bulbs to work with a Smartthings hub.  I guess z-wave is preferred over wifi (so I've read), but also not trying to spend $50 for a switch and outlet.

dmv2vc,1571996574,IOT noob questions,"Im looking to automate a few things in my house, and Im struggling a bit, and hoping to get some help here.

Equipment I already have :

* Android phone
* Ring doorbell (which sucks  badly, but Ill keep it for now)
* cheap, non intelligent RF (4333 Mhz) controlled sockets with a remote for most of my ambient lights.
* harmony hub to control TV/amp/chromecast, using logitech software or google assistant.  (I mistakenly thought the logitec hub could control those RF sockets)

I will be adding Tado smart thermostat system next week, and Im looking in to automating the lights and window blinds.

For the lights, I could just replace everything with smart sockets or smart bulbs, but Id rather not, I like my remote and dont like spending unnecessarily. So I was looking at a Sonoff RF bridge like [this one](https://www.amazon.de/Docooler-Intelligente-Wi-Fi-Fernbedienung-Automatisierungsmoduls-Kompatibel/dp/B07TBM32DG/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=).  I assume that would work?

For the software, Ive been playing with google assistant and IFTTT, but I think I will need something else and I have no clue what. Examples of things I would like to do:

* Close the window blinds 15 mins or so after sunset. Open them after sunrise.
* flash lights for a few seconds when some one rings the doorbell. I might get a few RGB bulbs to flash in a particular color if possible. After flashing, go back to how they where.
* when I execute a logitech activity, like ""watch TV""  (or some routine  that also executes that same logitech activity), turn up the heat in the living room, and turn on the ambient lights provided its dark.

This sounds pretty simple to me, very much ""if this then that"", but it doesnt look like IFTTT lets me do this without running my own server? It also doesnt appear to be something I can do in google assistent with custom routines either (especially since they are not yet available in my region, but even when I set it to english, I cant see it go that far).

I'm thinking of way to retrofit my house with smarthome technology, but my knowledge always falls flat when it gets complicated.

My house already came with built-in inwall speakers, which have never worked. I've been thinking about removing them and inserting a google home mini in their place. I have found an adapter, and with some work I will be able to fit them in place. The issue however is power deliery. As we know, GHM has only a micro-usb port for everything. The speakers were rigged only for some (I believe) RCA cables (image attached, and yes, it does look like shoddy work, but I only removed these covers after 5 years of being here).

Is it possible to either:

a) Use these existing cables as a PD option?

b) Supply power by replacing the cables? How would I do this? Get a huge USB cable, or is there a way to use electrical wire, and with an adapter, fix the voltage and add the micro-usb end to it, and plug it in to the GHM? What would be the best solution here?

I'm on the hunt for a solution to a problem I'm breaking my head over for a couple of weeks now, and I can only imagine I'm not the only one who is in this situation.

A year ago I bought an apartement with an intercom system in the hallway of the building.

Me and the other residents are sick of this system and we would like to replace/adapt to this system. The minimum requirements are that we are still able to unlock the door through the button and have video feed (otherwise there is no added value).

Site re: support: https://community.smartthings.com/t/home-decorators-ceiling-fan-light-controller-mr101z-first-impressions/81408

The thing is, the HDC fan only has power and neutral -- It does not have a separate motor or light wire.  The receiver thing has a motor L, motor R, and Light; while the fan itself has a motor black, and motor white.

Has anyone had success making this fan or a similar one work for smartthings? do I put the light with one of the motors? Is there a switch that would be easier than using this receiver?  Any help would be appreciated.

This is a hardware tip for all of you who need to deal with multiple strands of cables which also need to be connected and disconnected often.

If you hate crimping and how terrible (in terms of frequent connecting and disconnecting) pin connectors are, you can try this alternative. I'm talking about a specific microUSB breakout connector.

I'm able to create the join about 7 min, which is slightly slower than with the JST connectors, but the connection is longer lasting and stronger

dniuba,1572119607,Geeni Security Camera CW007 &amp; Other IoT devices w/o Android?,"Hello r/homeautomation ! I'm sort of the resident geek and technologist wherever I happen to go. A friend of mine found a Geeni CW007 camera that was abandoned whilst doing his job (he finds all sorts of things, he's one of those Lucky Bastards, I call them) and finally today I decided to tinker with it.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem with this device and all of these IoT devices is that there does not appear to be an option to use them without Android. I had to go to the Google Play Store and download the Geeni app, insert my phone number, give it the wifi password so the camera could connect using its internal 802.11 2.4GHz radio. It works OK under Android I guess but I don't like the idea of having it be Android agnostic or essentially having a third-party app that is sending data to Lord knows where...

&amp;#x200B;

I know the Geeni Security Camera CW007 I have when connected via USB does not offer video options like UVC like a webcam would, it merely provides power to the device (I checked using dmesg and such things under linux).

Speaking of Linux, it is also my understanding a lot of these IoT / home automation devices use minimalistic linux SoCs on board. I've looked on github and I've looked online for a teardown or reverse engineering of the device and I haven't found squat. I did notice through the Geeni app there is a method to flash firmware over the air... which could be a potential vector for getting around the Android stuff.

I haven't tried an Android emulation layer yet for this particular thing, in the past when having problems with a more obscure payment processor software for a friend I tried an Android emulation layer on Windows and it didn't work, sadly.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any resources from an IRC channel on freenode or a personal project site or perhaps a github repo I missed where people are reverse engineering these things to not require Android? If not, I am a bit tempted to break out the Xacto knife and tear open this particular unit and see if I can't get a good glimpse of the SoC and circuitry.

HA environment: I use OpenHAB 2.4 and I have Lutron Caseta, Insteon, and Philips Hue v1 bridges configured and working fine. However, I've recently started playing around with some smart plugs loaded with the Tasmota firmware (using tuya-convert) and interfacing with OpenHAB via mqtt and I quite like that setup right now.

My house (built in 1989) is almost entirely recessed lighting.

I've replaced manu of them with LED retrofits (from Costco) with smart switches (mainly Lutron Caseta), and that's fine for most of the house.

However there are a couple that I need to work differently. But I'm having trouble finding any 5""/6"" retrofit lights that work with tuya-convert. I have found several on Amazon that use the Tuya or Smart Life apps, so I assume they're flashable somehow, but nothing that confirms they work with tuya-convert. I'd greatly prefer tuya-convert right now because I recently moved in and the things I'd need for physically flashing the bulbs are all still packed away in the garage somewhere. Also aesthetically, my wife really prefers the one piece look of the LED retrofit kits over a regular bulb and trim.

dnni9q,1572143229,In-wall outlets offering dual control?,"Inspired by someone's tifu-style post here a while ago about how they over-automated their system to text their wife whenever the washer was done (his wife hated the idea), I showed the post to my girlfriend, expecting a chuckle.     
Not only was she not horrified, she insisted I do the same. And now she's asking me to set up an alert for the dryer.

I'd rather not just keep buying more plugs and maybe more importantly, two plugs won't fit on the outlet we use for the washer and dryer. My thought is to get an in-wall outlet that will monitor energy usage and I can use that to set up alerts based on custom triggers. (And then I can repurpose that plug for some other automated shenanigans.)

In my own research, a lot of the in-wall devices offer control to one of the outlets, with continuous power to the other outlet. I've seen a few wifi based ones that allow control of both outlets, but I'm a little touchy because they're wifi and from unknown manufacturers. I've also seen the Insteon On/Off outlet, which fits the bill, but I'd have to get a whole new hub for just one device.

Now I'm trying to find ways to do some of the things I used to do on [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) such as:

* Notify when system has not armed by 11pm -or- simply auto-arm system at 11pm
* Notify when a sensor has been open for more than X time (freezer door for example) but no notification until then
* Announce when Schlage Connect (connected to Ring alarm) is locked/unlocked
* Lock the Schlage Connect if it's unlocked when system is armed

I tried looking at IFTTT but Ring alarm isn't even a thing there, only Ring doorbell.  Pretty much all my home automation is wifi-based, with the exceptions being the door lock and everything Ring Alarm which is all ZWave Plus obviously.  So I don't really ""need"" a hub to connect zigbee and other protocols at the moment, but if one could do some of what I'm trying to do above, that would be great and then worth the cost.

Are there special switches for this type of task or a specific way of installing a normal smart switch to make it function this way?

dnr04r,1572167691,What is the best way to build a new house for home automation?,"Please bear with my newb self. I'm actually knowledgeable in IT but have barely not dabbled in HA
I'm about to finally build my house and had some questions :
Please keep in mind that budget is limited as the wife rather get nice curtains than a wifi led fixture :p

There's tons of protocols out there I'd love for a standard open one that's generic enough to cover my needs as well as possible without binding myself to an ecosystem like apple's 

And at the edge of what is possible I'm OK with fitting smart plugs for example.

I do have 2 google home minis already at this stage.

1. I'd want to be able to tell how much energy each of my devices are using

2. I'd want to be able to turn off/on these electric points

3. I'd want to be able to control/monitor stuff from android device / browser / Google mini

4. I'd want to be able to issue rules and alerts maybe ifttt? 

5. I'd want to be able to fit in sensors to record info about temp/humidity/noise level/light level/status of openings

6. Ideally maybe integrate with a CCTV system (I have 2 hikvision I can change those to something more appropriate if needed)

7. If the whole system could avoid being paralysed during an Internet downtime that'd be great.

8. Id like to avoid having to subscribe to anything beyond deploying my own setup maybe via docker to a provider of my choosing and otherwise run it off a couple of vms off my home server.


9. I'd like to know what's the base stuff I need to implement before the house is finished or right as it is and thus invest in that now and scale up to cover all my needs as money is available.. Essentially have a road map 

I hope I asked all the right questions.

I flashed them with Transmota using tuya-convert OTA and everything is good.

I then used a 60W bulb and my Kill-A-Watt to fine tune the readings.  All looked good; the values reported by the plug matched the values on the Kill-A-Watt.

Today I tested them with my washing machine and drier.  So power-&gt;AWP04L-&gt;Kill-A-Watt-&gt;appliance.  One plug is for the washer, one plug for the drier.

I noticed something odd; when under high current (say 10A) the voltage reported by the AWP04L dropped, but the voltage reported by the Kill-A-Watt didn't.  Similarly, spot checking, the plug consistently under-reported current (and so also VA) and ultimately total KwH.

For the washing machine plug1 reported 0.176KWh but the Kill-A-Watt reported 0.25KWh.
For the drier plug2 reported 0.477KWh but the Kill-A-Watt reported 0.57KWh.

So both plugs, which were calibrated correctly with a 60W bulb, under-reported.

- battery powered with decent battery life
- possibility to store temperature readings for future retrieval

do58gm,1572245407,Smart Home with cheapest way,"

Home automation or demotics is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things.

A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub or ""gateway"". The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface, that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.

While there are many competing vendors, there are very few worldwide accepted industry standards and the smart home space is heavily fragmented. Manufacturers often prevent independent implementations by withholding documentation and by litigation.

The home automation market was worth US$5.77 billion in 2013, predicted to reach a market value of US$12.81 billion by the year 2020.

Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC): it is possible to have remote control of all home energy monitors over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.
Lighting control system: a ""smart"" network that incorporates communication between various lighting system inputs and outputs, using one or more central computing devices.
Occupancy-aware control system: it is possible to sense the occupancy of the home using smart meters and environmental sensors like CO2 sensors, which can be integrated into the building automation system to trigger automatic responses for energy efficiency and building comfort applications.
Appliance control and integration with the smart grid and a smart meter, taking advantage, for instance, of high solar panel output in the middle of the day to run washing machines.
Home robots and security: a household security system integrated with a home automation system can provide additional services such as remote surveillance of security cameras over the Internet, or access control and central locking of all perimeter doors and windows.
Leak detection, smoke and CO detectors
Indoor positioning systems (IPS).
Home automation for the elderly and disabled
Pet and Baby Care, for example tracking the pets and babies' movements and controlling pet access rights

do716x,1572258860,"Control your computer using your Home Assistant (Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa)","*(Probably)* the **easiest** way of controlling your computer using your personal assistant.

AssistantComputerControl *(or ACC for short)* is a piece of free, open source software for your computer *(Windows only* [(why?)](https://acc.readme.io/docs/why-no-mac-apple-support)*)*, that allows you to do all sorts of actions using your voice! Used by \_(at time of writing)\_ 29437 people spread over 145 countries, the software has been helping people do actions on their computers since December 2017!

**Here's what you can do with the software:**

* Turn off your computer (shutdown)
* Restart
* Lock
* Open files
* Turning off your monitors
* Log out
* Putting your computer to sleep
* Muting/unmuting
* Setting PC volume
* Pause/unpause PC music
* ""Previous"" and ""Next"" music/video track
* Show a message box
* Creating &amp; deleting files
* Appending text to a file
* Writing with your voice: *""Hey Google | Alexa, write out* ***reddit post***""
* *more to come - suggestions very welcome, and almost always implemented*
* *Full always up-to-date list found* [here on the website](https://acc.albe.pw/#what-can-it-do)

You can also automate your computer-control rather than executing actions with your voice. As ACC is IFTTT-powered, you can make ACC lock/turn off your computer when you leave the house, open a specific file when you come home, open team-viewer from anywhere for remote-control - there are *a lot* of possibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Download:**You can download the latest version of AssistantComputerControl at [the ACC website](https://assistantcomputercontrol.com)! :) The setup only takes about 5 minutes; after the setup, you won't even notice it's there.

&amp;#x200B;

**How?**ACC uses free cloud services and IFTTT to work and for it to remain free-to-use. This means you will have to have a cloud service like Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive installed and running on your PC, and have an IFTTT account.

*If you're interested in more detail on how ACC works, take a look at* [*this documentation article*](https://acc.readme.io/docs/how-it-works)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Open source, community &amp; more info**

As said, the project is open source, and can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/AlbertMN/AssistantComputerControl) *(not updated as frequently as the official website-version, so don't get the installer from here)*. Suggestions and bug reports *(as well as questions)* are always welcome. The main place to do this is the [ACC Discord server](https://discord.gg/B9YGPNF).

This software is for the home-automation community, and all suggestions *(that I as the solo-developer have time to do)* are added :) Over 50% of all actions come from user-suggestions!

&amp;#x200B;

*I want to emphasize that there are no intentions other than spreading this software to people that can use it - I earn no money  from this other than a few donations from people willing to help out with the hosting &amp; domain expenses. It's merely a hobby project, and it's gonna stay that way :)*",iversenMN,/r/homeautomation/comments/do716x/control_your_computer_using_your_home_assistant/,47,homeautomation,13

I managed to figure out a better way without another device.

The Problem: My projector's remote was Bluetooth only and not compatible with Harmony.

The Solution: Got a [button pushing robot](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-switch-button-controlled-compatible/dp/B07B7NXV4R) and stuck it to the remote.  The pusher integrated with IFTTT so that was the next step.

The execution:
[Create a SmartThings account and login here](https://account.smartthings.com/login).  SmartThings lets you create ""virtual switches.""  For my need I created what is called a ""Momentary Button Tile,"" but a virtual switch might be more appropriate if there's a discrete on/off action. Name it something that makes sense to you.  That's really all that is needed in SmartThings, it just serves as a go-between.

Note: You DO NOT need a SmartThings hub, it's just a virtual go-between.  This is the only SmartThings device on my account and I don't have any sort of hub or anything.

Add SmartThings to Harmony.  It'll add the virtual switch as a wall outlet.  Set it to turn on/off with the relevant activities.

Add SmartThings to IFTTT and create an applet for if your SmartThings switch is turned on, then X (whatever action you need), as well as one for if it's turned off.  In my case I wanted the same action for on/off because it was pressing a button but you can also change the action if needed.

That's it! I've got that little robot reliably pushing the power button when I turn my devices on and off.

I figured I'd share since I searched a lot for another roundabout solution and never found anyone mention this, but I stumbled into the idea of virtual switches and it kind of spun off from there.

A few years back I was a software developer at one of the new entrants in the market, qees. So that got me started with zwave and ZigBee and with the idea of having a hub that manages it all. 

With that in mind, I want to start adding some home automation to our 2 bedroom flat. I'll start with lights and then move on to heating (will need radiator thermostats like this one https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F122345551312 ), air conditioning (WiFi Daikin) and probably some sensors like floods, co etc. 

That being said, I'm starting with lights. First job will be to buy a hub (don't think I can do it without) and was looking for a smart wall switch that can be installed with or instead the current wall switch. Then it needs to be able to dim/switch the directly connected bulbs and also trigger specific scenes. Ideally, it should have a way to be pressed that just triggers the scene but doesn't modify  the directly connected loads.

In terms of the hub, I was thinking of going for a Hubitat and a Google home. Aiming to have most control local, but also have access from the cloud to monitor future sensors and probably a camera. Having the ability to create various quick acting scenarios is also quite important. For the wall switch, the one I'm currently looking at is the fibaro walli switch, but seems quite expensive at 100 euros per unit

Currently I have a range of smart devices through my home.  Phillips hue bulbs w/bridge, a few Echos, Nexia thermostat, blink cameras, Kasa outlets, apple tt and my new SchlageConnect deadbolt.  I have an iphone/ipad

&amp;#x200B;

My house is older but I've been working on implementing smart devices with what I already had.  The house didn't have a deadbolt on the front door when I bought it (only a knob with normal lock) so today I had the deadbolt installed with keypad.  I pulled the trigger on the SchlageConnect since it was on sale and also had been waiting for a deadbolt/keypad.  I am now realizing that the Schlage app doesn't connect directly to this to unlock from the app.

&amp;#x200B;

My current question is, in order to be able to unlock/lock from Alexa/my phone do I need to get a hub such as SmartThings?  That way I will have a connection point for further down the line?  Or is the easier route to return and get the SchlageSense?",bac0467,/r/homeautomation/comments/dohxhk/home_automation_guidance_schlage_connect_phillips/,3,homeautomation,5

dojci0,1572314650,Looks like Leeo is shutting down. ☹️,"Got this today.  Need to now spend lots more for similar solution for my needs. 


Dear Leeo Customer,
 
I'm following up with you after our email of August 28.  Unfortunately, we’re still facing a challenging situation and are unable to keep the network on.  When the third-party services that Leeo has paid for that are required to support the network run out, the network will stop working.  We expect that to be in the very near future.  Your and our Smart Alert units will no longer be connected to the net, and the app will no longer function.  As mentioned in our prior mail, we expect the color of your Smart Alert to turn white. While you will still be able to physically adjust the light level via the ring on the device, you won't receive alerts on your phone, and you won't be able to control the device with the app on your phone.
 
Some former employees of the Leeo team, including myself, are continuing to look for a path forward, and if we find one, that may include bringing the network back up.  In that event, we'll reach out to you immediately.
 
I'd like to add that the team really appreciates the written notes that some of you have sent to us expressing interest in continuing the service, including a willingness to pay a reasonable fee to support the cost associated with providing the service.  We're looking into that option, among others.
 
Bottom line:  I expect your (and our) units to go offline soon but remain hopeful that we’ll have better news in the future.
 
However the future unfolds, we appreciate the opportunity to have served you.

Anyhow I digress, I'd like to put out there what features I'm looking for/why and see if anyone has a recommendation.

Must haves: 
1) The ability to view the cameras live feed locally on the network even when the internet goes down (I'm in a rural area with very bad/flaky internet super unreliable and I'm mostly interested in viewing the camera while I'm home not necessarily remotely. Example: I'm home it's 3am my camera is downstairs &amp; I'm upstairs...I hear a noise..I grab my phone open the app to check but the internet is down (wireless networks still up just no internet)..i need to see that feed otherwise the camera is useless to me.

2) Android compatibility

3) I'd like the option for remote viewing of the feed &amp; motion alerts/recorded clips when the internet is available.

4) IR night vision

5) Free Cloud (size/hrs doesn't matter so much as long as it can handle a few clips at a time) or a  Local storage option.

6) Ability to record audio.

Optional but would be really nice to have: 

1) Works with Google Assistant, 
2) can be viewed on Chromecast.
3) two-way Audio
4) battery operated or battery backup

Could care less about: 
1) Paid Cloud storage 
2) Sound alerts 
3) PTZ 
4) IOS compatibility 
5) Alexa compatibility
6) weather proof (this will be inside so it doesn't matter)

I have been following this subreddit for some time, and I decided that it is time I automate some parts of my home as well.  


The main 2 things I would like to automate initially are :  
 \- 3 roller shutters  
 \- LED strip controller

After I have researched a bit the market, I kind of decided to go with the following Home Assistant on Raspbery Pi + Aeotec Z-wave USB stick.

For the shutters and the LED controller I would like some help.  
From what I studied, for the shutters I would have the options from the following companies: Aeotec, Fibaro, Qubino. The main reason for the selection was to be able to put the shutter controller behind the wall-switch. 

For the LED controller - Fibaro, Qubino. I would prefer to buy just a controller, as usually from what I have seen, the LED strips are overpriced, and the power source as well.  


In general I read bad and good reviews about each company and each product, and at the moment I do not know which one to choose. Someone says Fibaro is not that good, someone else says it is the best shutter controller he had.... If somebody had any experience with those, please help a fellow beginner :).

I'm currently considering the Sengled Flood light, as I can use it in an existing flood light fixture. I like this however the cloud storage subscription doesn't appeal to us. Sure for about $60/year we can see 7days history of video per week. Yet that's $60 that could be spent elsewhere! Especially if I could store the video on a local server?

Although, considering other options. Ideally, something that's not $250 unless it's definitely worth it. A product that has IFTTT, smartthings and/or google home compatibility. Likely wired, but can be wireless too.    
Looking at the ARLO setup. Not a fan of battery powered cameras.  

Does a reputable product that does not require a service subscription, but one that I can send/save videos to a network attached server, just plug in the path, and start recording on motion, exist?

Alternatively, what about using a trail cameras?

2.	Ability to shut off a breaker remotely
3.	receive notifications from breakers if certain conditions exist

In order to replace the Wink Relay, I of course turned off the breaker to cut the electric.  My office at my house is on the same circuit, so it's power was cut.  I got the switches installed and they are working fine.

I go back to my office and I notice the light is off.  The blue light is not showing.  I also hear a tick-tock sound coming from the older Z-Wave switch in my office.  I try resetting the breaker.  Tick-tock.  I tried air-gapping the switch.  tick-tock.

I checked out the wiring, it was fine.  Since I had an extra z-wave switch, I replace the one in my office and I have a working light again.

Anyone know if the tick-tocking switch is fried?  I found a few other posts that seem to indicate it's dead.  This switch is probably 3-4 years old if I were to guess.

Weve recently had a suspended ceiling put in one of the home bedrooms and we asked to have 4 led zones to mirror a photo we saw. After going up and having a look at the work done I was shocked to find that there are 4 led strips (possibly 5050) and the boxes they plug into have a IR receiver sticking out of each one.. the kit looks like it came from Amazon at around £20 for 5m. Long story short it wont work for me because trying to use the cheap Chinese remote while pointing it to the IR receiver on the ceiling isnt accurate enough to specify which strip you're adjusting. I'll be having words with the electrician soon but hes wired them all up to the 3rd switch on the a single switch panel on the wall (1 is for a main light and 2 is for spotlights).

Background out of the way.. I now need a RF method of addressing each of the 4 LED zones individually at minimal cost considering the labour already done by the electrician. I saw a DX8 wall switch on Amazon which looks pretty great but have no clue what else I'd need to buy to make it work and how much more wiring id have to have done. Is this suitable?
Are there any decent alternatives or anything with an actual remote control that works well for my purposes?
Will I need to swap the existing 3 panel switch on the wall for a 2 switch one and use the DX8 for the leds exclusively?

Other Lutron solutions are either much more expensive, or they do not offer the nice looking scene keypads.

For Zigbee / Zwave / WiFi solutions I can't find any nice looking scene keypads and also some people say that such systems aren't reliable enough.

I started Pani after a volunteer trip to Nepal building water wells for a remote village. That experience inspired the starting of Pani. What's nifty about the Pani app is that as people save water using Pani, we make donations on your behalf to charities that provide clean water access to people around the world.

Here's my problem: I have two monitors on my Mac at work but often use Chrome Remote Desktop at home, which doesn't play well with multiple screens. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to turn off sharing to the second display since I'm on a Mac. Thus, I bought an HDMI switcher that I can power off and sever the connection without having to manually unplug the HDMI each night. The HDMI switch has a remote, but I'm a relatively forgetful person and would like to have the backup of being able to remotely turn off the HDMI switcher. I figured there's a smart plug out there that would do the job. The plug would need to be connected to my internet at work, which requires EAP-PEAP authentication on a 5 Ghz connection (or I have an ethernet jack close by). I'd prefer to have an app, but I'm also happy to use a terminal. I'd prefer something around $30-40 if possible (I understand legit IP jacks cost $60-100...).",genesRus,/r/smarthome/comments/dpdq3p/internetenabled_plug_recommendations/,0,smarthome,3

dpm2vy,1572520810,Looking for thermostat info (UK),"Hi all,

I am from the UK and am looking to purchase a smart thermostat but don’t know what to go for.

Our current setup is 2x Radiators downstairs, 3x Radiators upstairs. (Lounge, kitchen, 2x bedrooms, bathroom)
These are run from a Logic Combi 24 Boiler. The boiler doesn’t have a thermostat currently, only a timer which we use to turn the heating on/off manually.
Each radiator has a thermostat on it, but the inherent problem with this is that if we leave the boiler on and the radiator thermostats cut off all of the radiators, the boiler will keep burning needlessly until we turn it off. We currently tend to keep all radiator thermostats wide open and just control house temperature manually by firing the boiler for certain amounts of time.

I’m aware this whole setup is rather inefficient so would like to upgrade by at least fitting a thermostat to the boiler.

I’ve briefly looked at the Nest and Ecobee and am confused by the room sensors. If I put the actual thermostat in the lounge, that would monitor the temperature in there. But if I put one of the separate sensors in a bedroom, how would that be beneficial given that we don’t have individual control over the radiators.

We have iPhones, and a google home for control outside of the physical device.

Based on all of this, which would be best to go for?",Djphilg,/r/smarthome/comments/dpm2vy/looking_for_thermostat_info_uk/,2,smarthome,1
