ckhotg,1564623423,Echo Plus can't reach all Sengled bulbs,"Starting to replace some of my basement (unfished) pull chain lights with Sengled bulbs. I have one currently hooked up and it's having problems connecting, and staying connected. So I've stopped trouble shooting for now. 


I was troubleshooting one bulb, took it upstairs connected to a lamp next to my Echo Plus, and it discovered it perfectly. After I moved the bulb back into the basement it went ""unresponsive"" after a couple of hours, and after a couple of on/off.


My Echo Plus is in the most central location of my house. I have 8 Sengled bulbs already attached to my Echo Plus and they've been working great.


I guess what are my options?


Would buying more Sengled bulbs turn them into a bigger mesh?


Do I need some type of repeater?


Some type of hub?


I have 1 Echo Pluse, 1 Echo, 1 Echo Dot.


Any suggestions/recommendations would Be great!

cko1nf,1564664302,Need solutions for 3 seemingly simple smart home problems,"I want to do 3 things with smart home devices but I have no idea where to start.

1. Turn on outdoor lighting with proximity &amp; sunset info- i.e., I only want my lights to come on between sunset and sunrise, if me or my wife's distance to home is below maybe 2 miles and decreasing with time. A much simpler and probably as effective solution would be a combo of motion and light sensors- but I'd still like them to be ""smart"" to not have to mess with the electrical wiring, and to control other devices in the future.  Devices that screw into the outdoor light sockets could possibly work.
2. Send me an alert when my freezer loses power. I have it hooked up through a WeMo smart plug but the default app only alerts me when power comes on, or any time it cycles- it doesn't differentiate between cycling and the circuit breaker popping (and ruining hundreds of dollars of food). I basically only want an alert when the WeMo goes offline.
3. Control to multiple thermostats based on the occupancy of one. We have an Ecobee system upstairs with the main unit in our master sweet and a node in our toddler's room. Problem is she is not big enough to trigger her occupancy sensor while she sleeps. But if we ditch her node we are only controlling to our room, which will freeze hers. I suppose we can just control to an average but we already have her node so I'd like to use it.

I don't really want to mess with voice commands to set it up... I am comfortable with programming/scripting so I'd love to  just do some IFTTT scripts and go from there.

ckoejt,1564666215,Combo CO2/Smoke alarm products that can be hardwired AND connected to wifi system?,"Hello /r/homeautomation   

currently, working on a couple rooms of a new first time house.   

My initial research had me wanting to purchase (2) kiddie ZCOMBO-G (1039833) units which i would connect to a Zwave hub. However, I have noticed that this product does not have the ability to be hardwired.  I haven't seen any alarms yet that can be hardwired and possess the ability to connect via wifi for mobile reporting.    

The plan, to install one in the basement and one on the first floor, both hardwired.  
Or, can I purchase battery operated units, get an adapter kit to hardwire them to the house electric?   

I was thinking on going with zwave connectivity hub because the smart lock we would like to purchase is zwave connect-able and we prefer connecting with google, as our most of our devices are logged with our google accounts.  We were opting to stay away from anything 'NEST' as it is quite costly. Definitely don't want anything that links to 'Alexa' - just don't trust that system, and the one product that does use Alexa (dot) doesn't work properly anymore, not even after factory reset.  Haven't decided one way or another regarding 'ring' products/system.  

I have explored previous threads for suggestions on Combo alarms, that can be hardwired and connected via wifi, but haven't had much luck finding a reliable suggestion.  I'll go back through the thread to see if i have missed a suggestion.

I searched for ""ADT"" in the thread and saw really cold opinions about it, mainly due to their service fees and proprietary equipment.

I bought a house that was built in the 90's with a wired home security system... it has 90 zones &gt;.&lt;.  There seems to be a lot going on here.  The first image I'm almost positive is the main board (powers the system, handles the user inputs etc.).  The house was a foreclosure, but I know they had the system running possibly up until 2015 when they moved out.  I can power it on, but it does throw some errors for some sensors and I know some sensors are not properly connected.  For example, the window screens have wires in them and they connect other wires coming out of the frame.  

A lot of it is labeled, but with code names vs. location (not all but a lot of it, some do have specific names).  The house had an old home automation (Crestron) from the 90's.  In the last couple images, the wall box is labeled as the Crestron/security interface.

Here are my goals:

1. System is operational (not necessarily monitored by a 3rd party)
2. System remains operational even with a power outage (at least for awhile).
3. Ability to connect system to home assistant would be great.

I've found [this remote control](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-Universal-Wink-Enabled-White-Ceiling-Fan-Premier-Remote-Control-99432/206591100) that ought to let me do that via a Wink hub.

It looks like I could buy a Pico remote and just wall-mount it, then program the buttons on it to control the fan (even though it has a light-blub symbol, but hey). But there's a chance I might want to turn my fan on and off entirely at some point (say, if I want to change the bulb in the light attachment), so I'd rather not patch over the existing hardwired switch.

To my actual question: is it possible to buy an in-wall switch then program the buttons so that they *don't* actually control the power flowing through that switch? i.e. I press 'on' on the switch and it actually dispatches the 'turn fan on' Wink command rather than affects the power to the switch?

cl347g,1564746907,Connecting driveway sensor relays to Smartthings Shield,"Hi guys! So in my efforts to make a long range drive way / pool alarm, I think I finally found a good solution. I’m using a 1/2 mile beam system which transmits to a receiver inside my house. The system by HTZSAFE (although it’s just a cheap Chinese unit that I’ve seen rebranded) has relays out that can go into an alarm panel. If I’m reading their instructions right (and a little help from their support) their relays can be normally open and normally closed. Also, if im not mistaken, these outputs actually present voltage of up to 24v. (In fact their picture send to me is showing a resistor on the hot side of the circuit.) So, my goal is to now integrate that with my Smartthings shield and theres where im having the problem of not 100% understanding how that works. I’ve got my normal alarm system sensors connected to the shield, which I thought was just a basic loop. My assumption is that the system puts a small current through one side and returns back to common ground. (Probably something less than 5v but that’s my question) when theres a break in the circuit, the system no longer reads voltage and changes from closed to open. So thars where I’m stuck, I’m missing how to wire this up to get it to detect when the system triggers the board to send a state change. Any advice or help?

 Hello David,

Many thanks for your order and really sorry for the instruction is not clear enough.

Please kindly find the answers below:

1. Two boxes with X's in them: (I'm assuming these are not used at all, but please let me know if these are the common grounds.)

Yes, the boxes with XX  are not used at all (disable)

2. Each of the Channels has 3 contacts (please find a picutre --NO-NC attached for your reference, the left two contacts are NC, the right two contacts are NO )

    If the 3rd part circuit board has the Normally Close inputs, you just need connect the HTZSAFE Normally Close contacts to them. 

    Please find some pictures attached for your reference. (NC-1; NC-2; NC-3 )

Hope it helps and please kindly contact us if further questions.

Thank you.

Right now:  Wemo turns light on at sunset. (wemo app), turns off when I arrive home (ITTT)  (This is just to give the appearance of somebody being home)

Kitchen lights(Kasa): Turns on when I arrive home (ITTT)

All easy enough, but here is what I'm looking to automate, that as far as I can tell, I can't do now)

Sink overhead light.  Turn on when I turn on kitchen lights. (both are on a different circuit)  Full brighness if sun is up, 1/2 brightness if sun is down.

Outdoor lights.  Turn on when I arrive home-if sun is down

Hallway lights.  Full brighness when sun is up, not as bright by default after midnight.

All pretty simple things.  I like home for manually turning the lights on and off, but I'm not sure how to automate this.  ITTT is a bit too simple.  I can say 'IF I get home, turn on lights"", but there is no AND option.  ""IF I get home, AND its dark, turn on all lights"".

Also, I'm not tied to any system yet, so I'm open to all ideas.  I like the TP link switch, I have neutrals, but I don't mind going another direction.

Perhaps others can contribute improvements, who knows.

I wanted a solution that would use the Apple Alarm Clock as I wouldn’t trust a third-party app. Apple has millions of people waking up to their app, know it, have had controversies related to it and have made it bulletproof. Only solution was therefore to use Shortcuts, which I have to admit is a lot more versatile than I initially thought. 

The shortcut simply prompts for a time using the iOS time picker, then sets three alarms (one every five minutes from the set time). Then it makes a call to Home Automation’s REST API to set a service’s value (don’t use states, they’re broken as hell). I can share that if people want. The hardest part was figuring out how to trigger the automation 30 minutes early. Not to speak of attempting to use webhooks which I couldn’t for the life of me use to set a state based on the data I sent. 

Here’s the iCloud link for the Shortcut: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c0839ad3a95b4a13b6b37970a0546168

I got some Xiaomi smart RGB lightbulbs and I got them configured with google home. I can turn them on/off or change color, the regular, using voice.

For insance, my room has a ceiling lamp with three Xiaomi lightbulbs. On the wall, there is a classic light switch which turns the ceiling lamp on or off. I want to connect the wires so that the ceiling lamp always gets current and ditch the classic light switch and in its place I want to connect a smart light switch that turns on/off the lights from google home, not from the physical connection.

I want the ceiling lamp with the Xiaomi light bulbs to always be powered from the mains but the on/off to happen over wifi through google home or something alike.

Is there any remote/switch or something that I can mount to the wall (battery powered is ok) and can turn on/off certain smart lightbulbs? 

I need this because not all the people in the house know to operate the smart bulbs by voice and I want them to have a physical switch to turn them on or off  and at the same time, I don't want them to lose power which happens now with a classic light switch.

just wanted to confirm the followings

1.well the above work smoothly together , where through my google home nest I can view , control ,command , and retrieve status for all ?

2. Will cloud storage be functional , or local storage is possible with mentioned setup ? If not , what are my options for storage ( I cannot subscribe to any professional monthly monitoring) N/A in Dubai yet.

3. We use here 220v power , will this be a problem .?

4. Is this is the ideal setup I should consider ? Or do you guys have any other suggestions ( was looking at Abode as an alternative but felt nest is superior )

cluy9e,1564914866,[RANT] Why aren’t there more smart light switches?,"I’m in Australia. I’ve been looking at smart lights for about a year now. I can’t believe there are so many smart light BULBS, and so few smart light SWITCHES. 

If you turn a smart light off at the switch, the only way to turn it back on is at the switch. If your smart light bulb breaks, you have to buy all new electronics inside it. 

If you had the internet connection in the light switches:
Much less likely to break, can keep any existing lights (including antiquated/weird form factors), can be a button so that they are agnostic to physical or software trigger, and they could trigger or even monitor energy usage of any appliance, not just lights!

I suspect the reason there aren’t more smart light switches is companies will make much more money off repeat customers, and the best way to get repeat customers is to sell a consumable good (ie light bulbs break more often then light switches).

The disadvantage is you can’t control effects eg colour from the smart light switch, but there’s no reason you couldn’t have both at once! 

Am I missing something? Smart light bulbs just seems like such an annoying compromise as soon as the light gets turned off at the switch.",dekkers21,/r/homeautomation/comments/cluy9e/rant_why_arent_there_more_smart_light_switches/,1,homeautomation,6

clvumn,1564922263,presence per room without PIR/radar (ideally zigbee)?,"Hi everybody,

I currently use `tasker` on our android phones to submit a simple boolean whether or not either of us are at home. This can be used for things like ""if nobody is at home, turn off all lights, fans, etc."".

What I am trying to do now is do this per room. ""if nobody is in the kitchen for 5 minutes, turn off kitchen light"", for example. I do have some `Xiaomi` PIR sensors as well as some `nodeMCU`s that I could hook up with PIR or radar sensors to determine if somebody is in the room.

However, there are currently five separate ""beings"" in this house (2 humans, 3 dogs). If I use PIR or radar, I will get irrelevant results. I couldn't always toggle lights depending on what those sensors report, because the dogs run through the ground floor and would keep triggering the lights etc. 

I have tried a usb bluetooth dongle with `ioBroker`. It was supposed to tell me if I was in my office depending on picking up signal from my `MiBand`. This did not work reliably. I would prefer not having to use phones, because while I have a miband that I constantly wear, my girlfriend does not. She *almost* always carries her smartphone, but even if bluetooth detection worked more reliably, it wouldn't do any good those times she leaves her phone somewhere.

An idea was to use laser sensors at each door

* upside: could mount it at a height that would **not** trigger when the dogs enter a room
* downside:  needs to be *right* at the door to trigger entering/exiting the room
* main downside: if somebody enters an empty room, it cannot determine whether the next trigger means *this* person left the room again **or** *another* person entered that room.
* I guess one could install **two** laser sensors per door, so depending on which of those triggers first, it'd be clear if another person has entered the room or a present person has left that room (but come on! two sensors per door would be overkill and look rather ugly, especially when using DIY nodeMCUs)

Is what I am trying to achieve even possible for DIY home automation and affordable without spending more than is worth it? It's not like I'd **need** to switch off each light when there is nobody in that room (or whatever other device might be in there), I just think it would be neat; also it'd be quite nice to create a heatmap of who spends how much time in what room and when (for automating heat; instead of having a room warm all day, only heat it when it is likely that somebody will be spending a while in there).

I have read about iBeacons, though I don't quite understand the workflow. They interact with your phone, correct? So I couldn't just use my MiBand as a trigger for ""person me"" because the iBeacons ""are just there"" and do not report to my home automation server; also, same problem as above: if we leave our phone in another room, tracking would not be reliable (and I'd prefer no automation to false automation).

There are no Xiaomi laser sensors; that'd probably be the only way I'd use two of those per door because the other Xiaomi sensors I own (temperature/humidity/pressure, door/window states, switches, etc.) work pretty reliably and have decent battery life. Does anybody here know of devices that ideally meet my criteria:

* decent battery life (if battery powered)
* ideally compatible with `zigbee2mqtt`
* no need for additional components (i.e. smartphone required when using bluetooth beacons)
* no false triggers

If we did not have dogs I'd say one PIR sensor per room would get the job done. When it detects movement in a room, somebody is in it until movement is triggered in a connected room (though that would require quite some logic because some rooms can be entered from multiple doors...), but since that is not an option, I try not to think about it too much :D

Sorry for this long post. I was trying to describe why I need what as detailed as possible so that I don't get a solution that won't work.

cmatkt,1565010830,Roborock S6 -- Poor Experience or Bad Device?,"I bought a Roborock S6 (US) from their preferred eBay seller. The bottom floor of my house requires it to recharge before it can finish everything. This thing has worked successfully all of one time without intervention. I even had to factory reset the device the very first time I tried to use the Map Saving feature... no matter what I did, it would never sense the dock and begin recharging. It was stuck in some internal loop.

The support teams keep giving me the same steps to debug, which is often just cleaning the sensors and wheels. Which by the way, I feel like I have to clean this thing every single time it attempts to clean my house which is not something anyone ever mentioned in reviews. I also have 95% tile floors, not carpet, so it surprises me how much stuff gets wrapped around the moving pieces. I might as well just vacuum our house on our own for the amount of time and servicing this thing requires! When it did work, it seemed like a moment of magic albeit brief... so either I have a faulty device or all of the glowing reviews I've read about this thing are fake and this thing is about as robust as a home built out of toothpicks. 

In the picture below, you can see how the device is rotating the map after it either gets bumped by running over a cable, a dog, or thick rug. The LIDAR seems to be accurate but everything else is super buggy.

I'm going to send it back regardless but I'm considering switch over to the Neato D7. If I buy another S6, it will be through Amazon -- not eBay -- in the event I have another lemon.

I use TP-Link Kasa WiFi switches to control all my lights.

When the electrician installed it though, it only supported one wire, so the whole thing just turns on/off via the wall switch, and all the fan and light functions are controlled with an infrared remote control like everyone uses for TVs. That’s pretty useless, because I want to have the fan circulating the air almost all the time, but the light on only when we are in the room. 

So here’s my question. Is there some sort of IR emitter that I can program to the one function of the button on the remote that turns the fan’s light on and off? Which I can control via a new on/off switch on the wall (preferably TP-LINK)?

cmfap6,1565031800,Automatic power outlet ON/OFF control without using internet/cloud-based solutions,"Situation:  
I have a cottage in a fairly secluded location that I visit about one every two weeks, with a few security cameras installed that I access remotely via internet. For internet connection, my only option was wireless via LTE from my cell carrier, with their antenna/receiver installed directly on the building, from which a cable leads to their wifi/LAN 6-port modem/router.  At the location, I've got the cameras connected via wifi, a PC that's connected to the router via Ethernet (for me to use when I'm there, it's off when I'm gone), and a Raspberry Pi connected to the router via Ethernet as well. The Pi runs all the time and is set up for remote access to handle configurations and other network-related stuff if needed, as the router is not set up for remote access. Both the modem/router and the Pi are powered through a UPS. The internet speed is sufficient for my needs and stability was high enough as well, until last week.

A day before I was to visit again, the internet connection went down and all devices (the cameras and the Pi) were inaccessible from home. When I arrived there, I manually restarted the router and all was fine again. A day later, the internet connection cut out again, in the middle of the day, with no apparent cause – modem was on, LTE was connected and communicating with the parent network, but no internet. Another manual restart fixed it. I left a few days later and after several hours the internet cut out again.

Customer/technical support from my ISP didn't help, as they were either unable or unwilling to help me without sending their technician outside of warranty, which would have cost me about 10 months' worth of  that particular internet connection's plan. Oh, and the router settings offer no option of regular or conditional restart.

Goal:  
I want to be able to have the router restarted automatically (without me needing to be there) either when the internet goes down or at 4 in the morning, because apparently it's the only way to get the internet connection working once it goes down. Obviously, I would need for this to be done without access to the internet.

Question:  
Is it possible to set up a smart power outlet (for the router) that would be controlled either in an event-based manner (if internet connection is lost, power cycle the outlet to restart the router) or based on a schedule (power cycle at 4 AM every day) without relying on internet/cloud-based solutions? I have zero experience with ""smart home"" devices, sans the Pi which I'm pretty new to anyway. So far I came across some solutions that I might or might not adapt to my needs (the feasibility of those solutions is part of my question):

1. some potential solutions involve a smart outlet controlled via an RF remote control, where I would build my own RF remote control that would be controlled by the Pi, which I might potentially set up for event-based control using *cron* (check internet connection once an hour and execute a script if needed) or schedule-based control (execute a script every day at 4 AM).  
The problem with those is my total unfamiliarity with tinkering with electronics and building my own devices, so I don't even know if this can be done.
2. others involve smart outlets by various manufacturers, using various protocols, services, interfaces and whatnot.  
The problem with those is that all these interfaces, protocols, services, etc. are all opaque to me and I don't know if they can work offline to do what I would need them to do.

Such functionality seems to be never advertised anywhere (everything is ""control stuff from anywhere using our proprietary apps or google/alexa""), so any information regarding offline abilities for this purpose would be welcome as well. Oh, and I'm based in continental Europe, but I would be interested in solutions, products and information regardless of region or socket type.",Jaradjatra,/r/homeautomation/comments/cmfap6/automatic_power_outlet_onoff_control_without/,2,homeautomation,2
cmfdhn,1565032140,Is this actually an outdoor camera? (Netvue Vigil),"After weeks and weeks of research into affordable smart outdoor cameras, I decided to buy the Netvue Vigil, because of its good reviews and a colleague that's very happy with the camera.

When I wanted to install it, I was quite confused when I saw the power supply. The camera has a cable with three ends, one for power, one for ethernet and one is a wifi configuration button. The strange thing is that the camera's power cable connects to the power adapter via a connector that looks nothing like the connectors I've used before in my garden. As a bonus, there's no way to waterproof the ethernet port if it's unused. [Here are some pictures of this](https://imgur.com/a/H7iGTB1).

Furthermore, the plug is not IP44, so it won't plug into my outdoor multi socket.

All in all, I'm really sceptical whether this camera was actually built to be used outdoors, but then again the hundreds of 5-star reviews can't all have installed the camera in a barn or under a roof using a 100% dry power outlet.

some smart switches (GE for now).

I've done a bit of looking, but due to the general cost of replacing them all, it's low on my list... but still annoying.

I presently just use rechargeable button cells for most things, but I'll be damned if the companies don't just keep making new ones that no longer use the old batteries and of course they don't last very long in our disposable society.  :/

I'm not afraid to switch to an EXCELLENT system (for being forced into a new ecosystem)... but not just a ""good"" one.

cmgobz,1565037821,Advice for new home [Ireland],"Hi All,
Just looking for a bit of advice on plans for our new home. House is 3 bedrooms 2 storey semi-detached. 

What we have already?
Philip's Hue
Logitech Harmony Elite
Amazon Alexa (Echo Show 5)

What we will have in new house? 
More Echo devices for multi room audio
Heatmiser NeoHub for heating control

What else do we want to be able to do? 
A smart alarm system that will notify us of alarms, possibly talk to Hue bulbs to flash on alarm and be able to show us cameras - thinking perhaps Yale Sync alarm, is there a better option? 
External cameras x2 - thinking of going with Ring stick up cams
Buttons/switches for lights - are Hue switches best choice or is there something better? 
Motion sensors for store rooms and bathroom lights - should we just get Hue sensors? 
Would we be better off getting a Samsung Smartthings hub to tie it all together? If so, will we still have the same flexibility of using our Alexa skills and harmony remote, or will everything have to go through ST first? 
We might also look at working in some of the upcoming IKEA Smart Blinds when they release in Europe in a few weeks.",daithi1986,/r/smarthome/comments/cmgobz/advice_for_new_home_ireland/,8,smarthome,3

cmhj8m,1565041690,My automated Smart Home saved my house during the burglary,"Last week someone smashed into my Phoenix, AZ house through the backyard door. Thanks to installed smart home technologies I was able to protect my house, **remotely**. Burglar stole some not-that-important stuff from my kitchen counter-top, but it could have been much worse.

See full video footage and story:  
[https://medium.com/@jombik/phoenix-house-burglary-ded96e0dfe22](https://medium.com/@jombik/phoenix-house-burglary-ded96e0dfe22)

Now I understand I have been lucky. In my native country Slovakia we use to say: *""luck comes only to those who are prepared""*. That means, I was able to start Canary siren so fast because Ring door-bell notified me about someone at my front door first. Even when those two technologies did not mean to work together, they worked well for me.

The good part is it will work well even if I were at home. Security cameras are usually off when you are at home. But simple IFTTT trigger or Wink robot can turn them (temporarily) on, if some activity is detected outside.

A conclusion you should get from this post: if you are hesitating or postponing an installation of some smart feature, *make it happen*. The sooner the better. You never know when it comes handy. My kitchen camera was installed only a month ago, and put on the pedestal (for a better view) only a day before burglary.

- if we go that route, could we periodically plug a micro USB cable in for a day to charge them, or would we need to take them out and charge?
- Is there a specific solar charger that would work for these? We'd still probably need to buy batteries
- Is it possible to get the plug in transformer and go that route? We didn't order it initially.

cmk0xh,1565054577,Ref for All Connected Bulbs - what happens on a off-to-on transition,"I was wondering if I could solicit help in getting info about what different brands of bulbs do on an on-off-on transition.  It's one of those things that are (to me at least) really important to know before purchasing, but isn't documented and hard to find in reviews.  Most connected bulbs get used with manual switches, and some use cases require bulbs to go to previous setting and some would rather have 100% brightness.

Question 1:  If you set the bulb to 50% brightness (and some color/color temp), when you turn the bulb off at the switch and turn it back on, does the bulb go back to the previous setting (50%), or does it go to a default setting (i.e. 100% brightness and white).

Question 2:  what happens if it's turned off via the wireless connection, and then there's an off-on transition at the switch?  Does it use the previous state (which is off, so it stays off when power is applied) or does it go to the 100% brightness, or does it go to the previous on-state condition (say 50%)?

I'll try to compile responses into this first post.  Let me know if there's any errors.

&amp;#x200B;

Brand/type, protocol, scenario 1:  off-on at switch when in on state, scenario 2: off via connection then off-on at switch.

So this is what I'm planning to:

Put the buttons to push on and off my living room, dining room and kitchen light switches

Use Harmony Hub to turn on TV, switch inputs, etc

Use Harmony Hub to turn on one of my fan (which has a damn IR blaster) and use the switch for the other. Yea I have two fans. It's hot. And to install an AC in this house with no duct work would be &gt;$20k and worse take over a month of my time dealing with HOA. Eff that.

So my questions:

* Is this overkill?
* Is there a better button pusher that isn't completely insecure? Is it easy to create one using some toy robotics/Arduino?
* So I'm worried about the Harmony's Hub's range. [My living room looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/KqMOIMn.png)(not to scale duh). I'm gonna mount the Hub to the wall behind the couch. Will it reach all?
* I hate the idea of two hubs (Harmony, and SwitchBot) and the idea of three accounts (eufy being the third). I'd love to do all of this in one shot. Any ideas?

4. Cameras. I mainly want to be able to see if someone is in my driveway, at my front door, or back door with my phone or tablet, possibly activated from movement.  Maybe even a couple internal. And the ability to check the feed back a day or two would be nice.

My plan is to use a 120v unit and have it plugged into a smart outlet or plug that can send me a notification when that pump runs i.e. current is drawn through the smart outlet/plug?

I'm planning on doing some easy renovations to my mom's home and one of the things I wanted to address was her living room light. It's a plug in that uses a thumbwheel actuator to turn on and off. I don't think it's conventional mainly because she has to bend down to the ground to turn it on.

My solution to this was to plug her light into a Wemo plug so that she can turn it on through her phone, but that really only works through her phone.

Is there any way for me to connect the Wemo plug to a switch that would allow her to turn the light on and off like a traditional switch?

I'd like to keep the capabilities of the Wemo switch so that she can turn on her lights remotely, but I am open to other solutions.

I am nearly completely remodeling the inside of the house and am also doing a lot of rewiring as well. My designer had the idea to do led strip lighting as the primary lighting for the house, and have them hardwired to smart switches. However I was thinking that I could actually use RGB strips throughout the house so I can have control over the mood and colors as well as the standard dimming and automation control. However when I look at most RGBWW strips and their controllers it seems that they need a standard plug and power supply in order to work. Can I just hardwire them in to the switches so I don't need to have plugs in every room? Have them work like usual LED lighting? That would be the best I think.  


The other question is how other brands especially the cheap 5 meter RGBWW strips compare in functionality to the Phillips HUE strips. I am happy with the HUE bulbs I currently have, and do like the ecosystem. I know many ZLL controllers work with the HUE bridge, which then will link to my Echo devices, and I am planning to get a central hub (probably smart things) as well.

A while back I saw an alternative for the Hue Tap and I'm struggling to find it again.  

Basically what I want to do is cover a double light switch which control my kitchen lights (1x regular Edison bulb, 4x G10 down lights) as I have the Hive bulbs but out of force of habit we always flick the light switch off, making them redundant. 

Basically the ""thing"" I saw was a cover which you placed over the switches (leaving them always on) and when pressed the new cover switch would tell the Hive bulbs to turn off but as the switch is never flicked you maintain power and therefore a connection to the bulbs. It kind of defeats the object of them being smart but after 27 years of using a light switch it's difficult adjusting. 

I don't want to play with the electrics, just something I can simply retrofit, kinda like the switchmate but it's form factor was more like the Hue Tap. 

I imagine it would be using some sort of IFTTT

We rent a fairly old house, and the light switches don't have neutral wires. I run everything through SmartThings hub, and would like to control the candelabra ceiling fixture in our dining room. But I can't replace the wall switch with a smart switch because, again, no neutral wires.

Also, since we rent, I don't want to do any heavy rewiring.

The bulbs in the ceiling fixture are candle bulbs, I think eight of them. I could always by 8 smart candelabra bulbs, but that'll be expensive and probably kinda pointless since I'll never want to control them individually.

I've got 98"" mini horizontal venetian blinds.  Literally, all I want to do is be able to tilt them.

So far, the only one that I've found is [SOMA Tilt](https://www.somasmarthome.com/collections/soma/products/soma-tilt-free-solar-panel).  It's Bluetooth, or I could get a [bridge](https://www.somasmarthome.com/products/soma-connect-blinds-control-for-amazon-alexa-apple-homekit-google-home) to add voice capabilities. 



I'm very very new to SmartThings (like.. ""the hub is arriving on Thursday"" new).  Does ST work with Bluetooth or would I need to get the bridge regardless?

cn9cxx,1565201460,How to create quick single-tap iOS webhook “buttons”,"Is there an iOS app (or some other means on an iPhone) that would allow me to create a grid of webhook buttons (**which accept a json string**) that work like the example in this video (i.e. single tap to issue command, no changing of screens)?:

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptfxgy9fwlg1rfh/e-Control\_example.MP4?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptfxgy9fwlg1rfh/e-Control_example.MP4?dl=0)

Note, the beeping in the background is my air conditioner. If the command to be issued takes a second or 2, I want each tap to queue up the commands in series. So say I tap 5 times rapidly - I want all those 5 taps to result in 5 separate webhook calls regardless or how long it takes to issue the command / post the webhook call.

(Note, the requirement of **accepts a json string** means: not only is there a URL entry for creating the button, but also a text area to enter the content of the json. I only have 1 webhook URL and different commands are issued based on the json content.)

**Background:**

I recently bought a Broadlink RM Mini 3 and while the associated iOS app isn't very slick or pretty, it's highly functional, so much so that it has inspired me to figure out how to create my own remote interfaces that use webhook posts to issue commands. Here's an example of a custom remote interface I made for my first floor window unit air conditioner using the broadlink app (unfortunately named ""e-Control""):

https://i.redd.it/a6qsakzrh2f31.png

I have a number of automations setup in Node Red on a Raspberry Pi that I wish to control with webhook buttons. Many of the automations are also setup in Homebridge and thus, they show up in the Home app, but some simply don't work in the Home app (such as the volume controls for my stereo which I broadcast from my RPi at 27Mhz).

I have webhooks set up (e.g. for the stereo volume) and I can initiate them via Siri Shortcuts - and I even added them to the home screen, but I don't like the widgets interface and using the Siri Shortcuts app is slow and requires multiple taps per volume up/down command. The closest thing to what I'm looking for is the Siri Shortcuts widget screen. I also tried creating IFTTT widgets, but that's even slower because it requires 2 chained webhook posts.

So I've been looking for an app or some other way to create ""buttons"" that issue webhook posts that I can arrange at least in a nice grid like the broadlink app. It would also be great if it would ""queue"" the taps so that I can turn up my stereo volume with 5 quick taps, meaning if each tap takes a second or 2 to transmit, all 5 taps eventually get sent in series.

Does anyone know of a way to create webhook buttons like the kind I'm envisioning?",hepcat72,/r/homeautomation/comments/cn9cxx/how_to_create_quick_singletap_ios_webhook_buttons/,1,homeautomation,7
cn9n09,1565202729,Looking to Start a Career in Home Automation,"I graduated from college a few months ago without a job because my family needed help with some ongoing projects, but now that those projects are finishing up, I am looking for a job. I have been interested in home automation for awhile now, taking an IoT course with a fun final project and watching everything on YouTube from:

* Bitluni's Lab
* BRUH Automation
* Cameron Gray
* digiblurDIY
* DrZzs
* Intermit Tech
* SuperHouseTV
* The Hook Up

So with this interest, I decided it might be a good idea to try and get a job in the smart home/ home automation industry. The only problem is that I have been having difficulty finding the right job.

I graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a BS in Computer Science, but I am leaning more toward a mechanical job in the area of product design/ development. Most of the companies I look at are primarily hiring software developers, which I technically could do, but I have much less interest in a purely coding job. If anything, a job where I could use both of my degrees would be the best.

&amp;#x200B;

 **TL;DR and Conclusion:**

**So it comes down to this, I figured I would post here to see if anyone has any suggestions for places that might be good to work for product development in this space, or knows of some company from which the smaller home automation startups might be outsourcing their product designs. I am also open to suggestions for other related job types that you think might be good to look into ( for example I have looked at some building automation systems (BAS) positions.) I appreciate any leads or suggestions. Thank you.**

What that tells me is that it's not just a matter of what brand of bulb we use with our smart dimmer switches. We need to ensure that each bulb is working correctly. I replaced the one buzzing bulb with another identical one and the buzzing is gone.

Hopefully that helps someone else that is having these issues. My recommendation would be to install one bulb at a time and ensure that dimming is working without any annoying buzz.

I don't really need a lot from a thermostat:

* Ability to automatically run the HVAC fan if it's significantly warmer upstairs would be really nice. It looks like this can be done via IFTTT.
* Ability to program a schedule. Bonus if it will reach that temp at that time (a la Nest) rather than just changing the setpoint at that time.
* Either really good learning or none at all/ability to disable. Had a Nest, and it did really wacky things, but that could have been from 3 different people messing with it.
* Away detection is nice, but my roommate has a dumbphone so it would have to be able to detect via sensors rather than geofencing.

I have no interest in having a voice assistant on my thermostat, so my ecobee option is the [ecobee3 lite](https://www.amazon.com/ecobee3-lite-Smart-Thermostat-Black/dp/B06W56TBLN). 

On the Honeywell side, the two that piqued my interest were the [RTH6580WF](https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-Programmable-Thermostat-RTH6580WF-Requires/dp/B00Y6M2OUC) and the [Honeywell TH8321WF1001](https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-TH8321WF1001-Wifi-Vision-Stages/dp/B01K7Y1EC6).



Option | Cost after $50 rebate
------|---------------------
[Honeywell RTH6580WF](https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-Programmable-Thermostat-RTH6580WF-Requires/dp/B00Y6M2OUC) | $30
[Honeywell TH8321WF1001](https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-TH8321WF1001-Wifi-Vision-Stages/dp/B01K7Y1EC6) | $63
[ecobee3 lite](https://www.amazon.com/ecobee3-lite-Smart-Thermostat-Black/dp/B06W56TBLN) | $90
Honeywell + 1 [temp sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-C7189U1005-Indoor-Temperature-Thermostats/dp/B003UJYZDG) | $75
ecobee3 lite + 2 [room sensor](https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Room-Sensor-Pack-Stands/dp/B00NXRYOIQ) | $149

I'm leaning toward the Honeywell TH8321WF1001 + temp sensor. For less than the ecobee3 lite alone, it checks all my boxes except the sensor-based away detection. That's assuming it supports IFTTT - I can't find a definitive answer on this (edit: the Amazon page says it supports ""Honeywell’s free Total Connect Comfort services"", which is their IFTTT channel). The ecobee looks a lot nicer aesthetically, but I'm just not sure what more it brings to the table other than the sensor-based detection.

co1kr2,1565353062,Will Harmony Hub support Panasonic remote N2QAYB000710?,"I have a Panasonic bluray player (model DMP-BDT321). Yesterday, the remote ""died"". All the buttons on it work, but the touchpad is acting oddly - ""swiping"" up/down or left/right does nothing, only touching the very top 1/8"" performs an ""Enter"".

I was looking for a replacement for the remote, but that would run $30-70. A friend recommended a Logitech Harmony Hub. I'm thinking of the [All-In-One](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Harmony-Companion-Control-Entertainment/dp/B00N3RFC4G/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=harmony+hub&amp;qid=1565317331&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-5) (I still want a physical remote). But I am old and skeptical. My main question is; **will the HH remote perform the functions of the old touchpad?** (e.g. swiping between selections) Without this feature, the remote is practically useless.

I did a search in the Q&amp;A on the amazon page, and searched the /homeautomation subreddit, but couldn't find anything. I also checked the Logitech support page, but when I entered the remote into the Model Number field, it told me I entered the number of the remote (duh!). And when I entered the number of the bluray player, it said it was supported. Thanks, but these are two separate devices (I know I'm overthinking, but still).

Some background about my setup... In the living room; bluray player, Magnavox smart TV (39MF412B), Yamaha sound bar (YAS-101), Chromecast device connected to TV.

co4oyx,1565367851,What’s the deal with Insteon?,"As a relative noob, I’m trying to figure out why Insteon isn’t more popular around here. On paper it seems to scratch all the itches:

* Relatively high quality dimmers/switches that have a traditional look unlike Caséta
* Devices have a unique identity which makes you less reliant on Z-wave pairing and losing all your programming if you need to switch out your hub
* No (from what I can tell) arbitrary upsell-oriented device limits like I get with Caséta or even RadioRA2
* Devices are pretty cheap, especially with random sales from smarthome 
* Lots of support for lack of neutral wires
* Support for custom engraving and buttons
* Good integration with other automation platforms if you don’t use the official Insteon hub but instead go with some sort of ISY device instead
* Reasonably solid and semi-standardized underlying protocols over power lines and wireless

Note that I write the above having purchased or used zero Insteon devices, just reading around. Please correct me if I have it wrong!

So assuming I have no major factual errors above, I’m confused why most mentions I find of Insteon in this subreddit are folks saying Insteon is old hat and that they’d recommend (or already have started) phasing out switches and dimmers in favor of Caséta or Z-wave devices. The major reasons I’ve heard cited for that are: 

* Vague reliability concerns
* Vague “this hasn’t been updated in a while” concerns
* Apparently the official hub sucks and puts people off
* The company is headed in a questionable direction

Am I missing anything?

My situation is a major retrofit of a large house where the Caséta distance and artificial device count (even the new 75) limits are prohibitive. Furthermore, I’m balking at the thought of purchasing dozens of RadioRA2 devices for $100+ a pop, and am concerned about re-pairing dozens of Z-wave devices if I ever need to switch out the hub. Not even considering WiFi-based switches. Given all that, Insteon seems pretty appealing but it seems like the consensus around here is that it’s somehow old and uncool and it’s rare to see it recommended.

So I’m looking for evidence/anecdotes/data from anyone with experience with Insteon..",godofpumpkins,/r/homeautomation/comments/co4oyx/whats_the_deal_with_insteon/,49,homeautomation,120

I bought an air purifier (Philips ac2882/10) a while ago, and am now tired of pressing the buttons every morning and evening to switch from sleep mode to sensor mode. The buttons I am talking about are just 2 capacitive touch buttons, one to set Sleep Mode and another to set the Sensor Mode.  

I am not an electronics guy, but I do have an idea on how to do this. To my knowledge those buttons work by being grounded. So if I was to connect an Arduino with a relay shield, connected to ground and connect one end to the Arduino's ground and another to a metal ball on the buttons. Could I simulate the button being grounded that way?  

Or would it also work if I just passed a voltage through the metal ball?

cou4tc,1565510219,smartify dumb mobile AC (get current state),"Hi everybody,

I am trying to make my ""dumb"" mobile AC smarter. I live in Germany where few people have central ACs. So I only have a mobile AC in one room that is controlled via IR remote.

Already accomplished :

* power on/off via smart outlet running tasmota
* control device via broadlink IR transceiver that I manually thought the required IR codes

It works fine. However, when I turn it off **via IR**, then turn it back on, it starts at with previous values (set temperature, mode, speed, etc.). If I use the regular IR remote that came with the device, I (or my smart home server) won't ""know"" this values because I cannot track them.

Workaround that is very impractical: when turning off device, turn it off via smart outlet. When I **then** turn it back on, it will always start in cool mode at 25 degrees set. While I could work with that (use those initial states, then only control it via my server and adjust each value for each simulated button press), it is very much for work for nothing.

Instead I thought it would be great to attach a camera (raspberry pi zero w with pi cam module) that reads the ACs panel output, then detects words and symbols, then sends those values to my home server via mqtt. So when I use the remote instead of controlling it via my server, it can still detect  current speed, mode, set temperature, and - if set- sleep timer.

Could somebody try ping) pointme in the right direction on how to achieve this? I have done some research and of be able to do **some ** of this with **python** and *openCV*. However, I am a self taught hobbyists with no professional IT knowledge. From what I read, opencv can analyze images, but not video streams (or if it can, it went way over my head and I didn't understand how to do it).

Also, while I could detect set temperature and sleep timer via this method, unfortunately mode (cool, heat, dehumidify) and speed (slow, medium, fast, auto) are displayed by symbols instead of text / numbers. I assume that this could be detected via position because each of those is displayed in another area (mode for example is a 2x2 grid and each indicator lights up in a different area of this grid).

What do you suggest I do? I need to OCR the detected image for temperature and sleep time, then determine which are is lid up for mode and speed. Then transmit all these values at least every two seconds (I'd probably go this by sending all values as json via paho-mqtt in python).

Should I do this right on the (rather slow) pi zero and is send value to my server, or should I stream the video output and analyze it **on** my server?

Is there a better solution I haven't thought of at all? I would very much like the ability to still use my ""dumb"" remote cause it is more handy at night compared to trying for my phone, opening my smart home app, then setting a value. The server should handle automated tasks (if bedroom temp &gt; x degress at 2h before sunset, turn on ac and set to y degrees), but still be aware of manual changes I trigger via the remote. Even **if** I could capture each IR signal from the remote (which doesn't seem to work), it'd still be less reliable than ""just"" grabbing and processing the current actual values from the AC panel.

cou7xh,1565510954,Sengled woes,"I have had sengled element plus for about 3 years. I have 4 in my bedroom upstairs and 3 in the den downstairs, each set plug in to a hub in each room.  For Wi-Fi I use netgear Orbi. The den hub is plugged i through ethernet to the main orbi router, while the bedroom hub is also plugged in through ethernet but to the orbi satellite upstairs. The ones upstairs work flawlessly. The ones downstairs don't. Funniest thing is, the ones downstairs are so much closer to the hub physically than the one upstairs, so you would think it is the opposite but it isn't.

Primary use of these bulbs is Alexa commands. 

Issues I'm having:

When I set the bulbs in the den to off, they delay quite a bit. Sometimes they take up to 5 seconds to turn off. Sometimes, some will turn off first and other laterz about 2 seconds delay on each.
Sometimes, they will stop responding completely. At least 3 times, I have been forced to delete the hub and bunks completely and start from scratch because they stopped responding no matter what I did.
The hub is inside a home theater cabinet so it's extremely  difficult to remove and reset.

I am about ready to throw in the towel on these and go for a Lutron switch or something..
But why are the ones upstairs hardly ever having issues?

I say hardly ever because the ones upstairs have a much less frequent issue where I have to unplug the hub and plug it back In to get it to work. But this is much, much less frequent and not nearly as annoying.

Any ideas? Do I have defective bulbs? Is sengled just complete shit? I have never owned any other kind of bulb. Never could stomach the Phillips pricing.

If not I think I should just need a simple IR blaster to adjust settings on the mini-split and something like raspbpi. But the hard part would be the software I think.

Would it be best to just write an entire (probably python) script from scratch or somehow integrate it into something like IFTTT? What I want it to do is:

Adjust temperature setting as frequently as every second. (Maybe minute?)

Read remote thermostats to better cool the area.

Utilize local hourly/live forecast to adjust indoor temps.

---

What I was looking for originally was something that would let me specify when I get home to start slowly cooling/warming the room, then once I reach a geofence rapidly cool/warm the room. Then once I've arrived gradually adjust to a normal temp (67F?). Additionally, I fall asleep better in a cool room, but being cool all night then going to work where they keep it 73F makes for a very miserable day, so I want to be able to set it to a cool temp (65F for example), then slowly throughout the night increase until 73F.

If I'm going to DIY, I could use some suggestions for software, hardware, math equations, anything really.

Figure that way I could set it up to stay on much longer if a physical button press, and stay on for the shorter duration when triggered by a sensor (which is typical when just going in/out for a moment).",mshaefer,/r/homeautomation/comments/cpg39m/smartthings_core_is_there_a_way_to_differentiate/,8,homeautomation,11

1. Is this for just dimmers or do pico remotes count towards this as well. I think it is the latter.
2. Is the limit for devices attached to the smart hub? Or for all devices?
3. If I go without a hub, can I exceed the 75 device limit?
4. Assuming 3 is true, can I selectively add some devices to a hub to stay under the limit? Can I just add dimmers to the hub but not Pico remotes? I realize that will limit my ability to control some dimmers (not connected to the hub) from my phone but it may be a good compromise.

I’m moving into my first house this week and I hope to set up some lights via 433Mhz RF transmission. 

My plan is to have some RF light switches that talk to an RF bridge that then is able to control my lights (via home assistant)

I just wanted to clarify something with the RF bridge and make sure that my understanding is correct before ordering the bits.

So I see that the Sonoff bridge says that is able to control 4 devices, but my understanding is that this is 4 devices that each have 4 functions. 

Does this mean then that I would be able to control 12 light switches, as all the bridge would be doing is relaying a signal to home assistant, which would then change the state of the light?

I'm waiting my zigbee2mqtt items to arrive so I can setup my sensor with that. I have rasbperry pi setup for that and got home server with home assistant docker container running.

I'm thinking to switch my living room lights (13 x GU10 bulbs) from halogen/led mix to smart lights (ikea trådfi GU10). This would be my first room with smart lights.

Current dump dimmer I have has one [large round ""button""](https://www.clasohlson.com/medias/sys_master/9580166578206.jpg) which rotates.

I thought I save few euros by keeping the old dimmer (new smart one is 70-120€ + installation probably another 120€+, because it's legally only allowed by electrician). And I know that dumb dimmer doesn't work with smart lights, 

I was thinking to mount ikea switch on top of current one or near that one. And modding current one so it couldn't be turned down accidently. (shouldn't be so hard to do)

Reason why i'd like to have smart lights instead of zigbee controlled light switch, is customization. I would like to have little dimmer lights at different part of my living room.

&amp;nbsp;

Products what I think I buy from ikea:

- [GU10 Bulbs \(with cool white\)](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tradfri-led-bulb-gu10-400-lumen-wireless-dimmable-white-spectrum-90408603/)
- [Wireless dimmer](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tradfri-wireless-dimmer-white-00347831/)
 - or even better [Remote contoller](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tradfri-remote-control-30443124/)
- [Signal repeater](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tradfri-signal-repeater-80424255/). because zigbee2mqtt only supports 15 devices at time.

Hello, I’m not sure if these linked images will help or not. 

I’ve gotten pretty savvy at hooking up single pole smart switches and dimmer switches in my house. My choice switch has been the Kasa switches. Unfortunately they do not make 3 way dimmers so I went with something I found on amazon on prime day (justcool).  The wiring in my house has been perfect for the single poles. But I’m having trouble deciphering how to hook up the 3 ways. I’ve perused this subreddit and did learn that white wires can often be used as the hot in older homes.  I do observe some white cables in the box of 3 switches that have black tape on them but then they’re coupled with a wire nut to black wires that go back into the wall. 

Note: pics 1 and 2 were before I hooked up the kasa smart dimmer on the left.  Pic 3 has it installed. I ran the neutral into the big bundle of neutral wires (unsure if any of these serve as neutral for the other two  3 way switches as well? I planned on hooking up the master switches here. (The middle switch is the one that runs to the add on location in my next paragraph.)

I  took pictures of where I planned to hook up the add on. The add on spot for the far right switch is wired the same way. There are more wires there than I know what to do with on the existing switch. If I identify the travelers and hook them and ground to the new add-on switch do I just put a wire nut on the remaining cable and not hook it to anything? (Maybe the white?)

I also added pics of the new switches and the instructions that came with.  

I understand if everything I’ve provided is not helpful enough and/or clear enough. I’m just taking a shot and would appreciate any insight! I can provide additional details or better pictures when I get home later.

Does anyone have any insight on that?

Additionally, I asked what the status was on SmartThings Integration, as there's been rumors floating around that could be coming soon (I know I should be trying to move to [Hass.io](https://Hass.io), I just haven't taken that step yet). Are there any developments in this area?

I'm looking for something hopefully UL Listed.

I would simply use something like [THIS](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Aeon-Labs-DSC26103-ZWUS-Z-Wave-In-Wall-Micro-Controller-Micro-Switch-G2-SR/143104029205), as I already have them, but they're $30 each. Sonoff/Shelly are coming in under half that price. And Sonoff doesn't natively allow for manual existing switches without some modifications.

I do have 2 GE Z-wave switches/dimmers along with 3 Leviton Z-wave switches/dimmers (got them for $7 each as package deal).  While researching DIY alarm system, this had lead me to IP cameras (which all 9 are setup already on dedicated Blue Iris PC) and home automation since best to run wire now (I run communication wire for my day job) while access holes everywhere.

I was looking to get 3 of those Morning Rise 12v (or 24v) automated shades for my windows and 24v LED strip mood lighting around the ceiling in the living room for now but future rooms and stairway possible.

I am unsure how to wire these items.  I have the opportunity NOW to run hard wire to any item while access holes in the walls.  I believe the simplest way would be to put an 110v AC outlet every 20' along ceiling for 2 or possibly 3 runs of LED strip lighting.  AC outlet near every window for the auto-shades.  But this seems...extreme or a waste, which would also require a electrical permit from the city due to it being AC.  However, I am in-experienced with what can work/what does not work when it comes to Z-wave and home automation in general.

Was hoping, could run 16/4 speaker wire to any 12v/24v motor to a wall switch (Z-wave or not) and then home run back to a central box that supplies the 12v/24v on DIN rails or something, along with home automated relay on DIN rails (I do not believe this would require a permit due to low voltage....i have research to do).  If any help with that, I'll listen!  But then, this brings up the question of the topic subject:

I am always concerned about computers going SkyNet on me, so manual or emergency control would be a mandatory thing.  If the home automation software (pretty sure I'm going with Home Assistant / NodeRED) and hardware (Z-wave related) are telling the Morning Rise shades to lower, what happens if I want to override that manually by pressing the ""shades open"" up button on the wall switch?

I'm about to embark on a fairly major gut renovation, and I'm trying to decide on what I want to use for lighting around the house. I have a laundry list of wants for the lights, though many of them are flexible.

1. Must have local control. I'd like to use Home Assistant to control them.
1. I don't want something that is going to phone home to whoever sold it to me. I want to buy a product, not a service.
1. I'd prefer a wired solution. Mesh networks are ok, but if I'm paying an electrician already, a wired connection will be more reliable.
1. I want them to be dimmable. Like *really* dimmable the way incandescents were. LED bulbs from the hardware store running off dimmer switches are almost universally awful. LEDs can dim to virtually nothing, if they're controlled properly. I want that.
1. They need to have a high CRI. 90+ preferably. 95+ would be even better.
1. I would like them to have an adjustable color temperature. I like having a warmer color at night.

I'm half tempted to design the system from scratch (I'm an electrical engineer), but I know that will end up being more effort than it's worth (like I said, I'm an electrical engineer).

cqpvxu,1565876004,Automating intercom with SwitchBot(s)... Any better idea?,"Hey everybody!

I discovered SwitchBot a few days ago and I ordered one with the idea to automate my condo gate.

The idea is/was simple:

1. Stick a SwitchBot on the intercom button that opens the gate
2. Activate it when I want to open the gate

The reality is not that simple:

* The gate button doesn't work if I don't first ring my number at the gate (not big deal I guess)
* The gate button doesn't work if the intercom handset is not lifted up

Here's some pictures of the intercom headset:

[https://imgur.com/a/tLzc7Y7](https://imgur.com/a/tLzc7Y7)

# What I tried

Keep the headset always slightly lifted so that the button is always active

This works, but the intercom rings only once, also, the headset is instantly activated, so anyone who rings at my number can listen inside my apartment.

# My proposed solution

I just ordered one more SwitchBot (actually, 2, but don't tell my wife please), so that I can use one to slightly lift the headset, and one to press the button.

This still doesn't address the fact I'm forced to ring at my intercom to make everything work, but it's also true that if I ring and instantly activate the SwitchBots, the intercom should ring only once, which isn't that bad.

Do you see any flaws in my plan? Any better ideas?",FezVrasta,/r/homeautomation/comments/cqpvxu/automating_intercom_with_switchbots_any_better/,3,homeautomation,4

In my dream, I have discovered a small mic hidden in the remote control for some gizmo. Asked a tech from the company it belonged to on how to switch it off. The tech was evasive for a long time, and finally said it was impossible to disable the mic.

Then it got worse. The gizmo itself - looked like an upside down laundry basket (pink in color, no less), but I totally knew in the dream it was just a large router - turned out to have a mic in it, as well. No, wait - the whole array of hidden mics!

Once again I went through the lengthy deliberations, only to be told in the end that **none** of the mics could be turned off.

Mind you, this crap was going on all night. I was waking up and falling asleep into the same continuous nightmare again.

The weirdest part is, **I never actually worried** too much - let alone being ever obsessed - about the lack of privacy due to the microphones listening in.

WTF. If the person like me is getting nightmares over this, does it mean the issue is more serious than I have realized?

cr2mpi,1565937880,Best smart lock + doorbell + security camera compatibility combo?,"So I'm looking for a security combo setup for my parent.

I’ve wired for them a mesh Wi-Fi network with smart switches and sound systems connected to their Alexa TVs and echos, and next I’m trying to setup a Door and security cameras for them (at least 4/5 cameras to surround the property; my mom over-worries). I’ll also be around often enough to recharge things if needed (hopefully the batteries last at least a couple of months though).

Right now I’m staring real hard at the Arlo 2 + Schlage Encode + Ring Doorbell 2. With those, I figure they at least can use one app look up their cameras from wherever they are, and then maybe just straight up use their Firestick TV/smart pop up/Alexa to deal with the door and not have to pay attention to any other apps. I also don’t really have to worry about the Ring 2’s crappy sensors/monthly recording charges since I figure for recording purposes, at least one of the Arlo’s would be pointed in that direction anyway, and that by going rechargeable/solar powered, I may also potentially circumvent any potentially crappy wiring problems that ring 2s supposedly suffer from (1960s house)

Of note is that their home is old enough that I don’t think they really have to worry about having to add a smart thermostat anything else for the foreseeable future (although i may play around with idea of having it automatically turn on the lights as they arrive later; for now Alexa does its job.) I can’t think of any other integrations to be consider or whose infrastructure I need to be mindful of. Also, all cameras/sensors would be in shaded areas, but temperatures fluctuate between \~40 to 110\~ F (which I guess is our new normal now... May have to figure out how to get them central AC at some point given the trends...). If wired, the some of the cables for the outdoor cameras may have to stretch up to 50+ meters (150+ feet).

Anyone got any other solutions or better recommends?",Gaimcap,/r/homeautomation/comments/cr2mpi/best_smart_lock_doorbell_security_camera/,18,homeautomation,21

The Huzzah checks the loadcells about once a second and publishes to an MQTT topic if the state has changed. The HX711 amplifier I used has two outputs so I can check both sides of the bed independently. I've been using it for about six months now and it's been very reliable.

crlmtq,1566045493,Where to start? - What Hub is best?,"Hello /r/homeautomation    

edit: i do not mean to say ""best"", i generally do not like that term, as there are many best products. I apologize for using this term. perhaps highly recommended for first time users? good starting unit to learn? are better alternatives, but with reliability.  thank you.

I'm investigating the best possible solution for our new home. I would prefer to use an ""open source"" type of setup over one that is proprietary such as nest.  

I have been reading in the sub about advantages and disadvantages of various products, mainly two that seem to best suit the devices we are ideally looking to utilize; z-wave &amp; smart-things functional hubs with schlage connect door lock, a compatible protocol thermostat such as honeywell wifi control, and a compatible smoke/co detector.

i have noticed that z-wave specific hubs and smart-things hubs which are compatible with z-wave devices have sort of a 50/50 love/hate. Especially smart-things.  

To Start, we would like to be able to merely control devices when we are away, monitoring via our mobile devices. Down the road, I could see making the operations mostly automated.   

My hearty question, what should we start with? I tend to lean towards a product that is sort of a jack of all trades. I am familiar with programming devices, yet do not want to get in over my head here. I feel like having the best hub to connect various devices will determine what devices we will ultimately purchase.   

My IT colleagues who also favor open source products recommend smart-things hubs. I'm inclined to take their recommendation. As I research i wonder, do i require more than one hub? house is only 1700 sq feet and all the initial devices will be located on the first floor. Then I have seen some comments that existing sensors can be integrated? I am wondering how people know that their windows are open? There was an ADT system install on the house, which we will not subscribe to service, but can we integrate the sensors to every window and door with smart-things? I'm sure there will have to be some sensory device connected to send reporting.

i'm sorry that I am novice, all the research i have been doing has been confusing me, as soon as i think i'm on the correct path, i end up reading something that discourages what i thought was going to be a well designed setup.  

please &amp; thank you.",TOMALTACH,/r/homeautomation/comments/crlmtq/where_to_start_what_hub_is_best/,4,homeautomation,25

crscxr,1566077954,Good Kinect 2.0 solution for Home Security Possible?,"Hello, I wanted to see if anyone has looked into using the Kinect 2.0 for home security/motion detection.  I have heard that this device was great for motion detection. I see several different applications for making 3D models and recording motion for 3D models. 

I have looked around for a DIY solution and have found a couple of things. Apparently DIY is not for everyone , or we would have seen tons of people doing more with the Kinect 2.0. There were hundreds of thousands of units sold during the XB1 release. I am guessing most units are now sitting in a landfill.

I hate to toss out the two units that I own, so I am looking to see if a DIY solution is possible for home monitoring. 

There are Two versions of the Kinect 2.0, one is for PC that released later than the XB1 version. The difference is that the PC version has a standard USB and Power adapter where the XB1 versions needs to be modded or you would need to purchase an adapter. The adapters are now on Ebay from China and cost around $12.

Here are the links that I have came across.

My Question is, has anyone found a good solution that they are currently using? There are a few links I have found, but they do not say much about how well these solutions work.

The fan has 4 sockets, which have been occupied by 60w 650 lumen incandescent bulbs for years. The LOHAS bulbs are rated 8w (50w equivalent).

If one of the four sockets is *not* occupied by a regular, incandescent bulb, the LOHAS bulbs blink in a very erratic manner. By this I don't mean the 'setup' mode blinking, but with a very irregular strobe-like effect (thank goodness I don't have epilepsy). I am only able to use a combination of 3 LOHAS bulbs and 1 incandescent bulb - if I leave one socket empty, or if I use all 4 LOHAS bulbs, they react with this strobing effect.

Does anyone know what could be causing this? I was able to successfully set them up to connect to my WiFi, the bulbs do show as online during this erratic behavior, and I am able to turn them on and off via the smarthome app, but the brightness slider has no effect. These are my first foray into smart home/automation, and I'm not super familiar with the electricity requirements, so I fear I made a very ignorant choice with these bulbs, despite there being no apparent electrical issue, especially since both the ceiling fan and 4x 60w incandescent bulbs have been able to operate for years without any issue.

crw85c,1566098981,I wanted to share a solution I found for a Line-in (120v) Thermostat in my Apt.,"I have two wall units in seperate roomes. The Thermostats, one in each room, turns on the fan over piped hot (winter)/cold (summer) water. The thermostats are 120v switches from the 1970s it seems. 

The solution: I realized the thermostats could be replaced with simple light switches. I did this to test my theory and it worked. Turning the light switches on and off turned the air on and off.

Next I replaced the simple light switches with smart light switches and connected them to alexa. I set up simple routines to turn them on by voice or be triggered by my arrival home. I also set them tonauto shut off after an hour. 

Next I used webcore code to have them turn on and off based on the temperature readings from my smartthings sensors. This worked only ok as the sensors are not very precise. I then got wireless sensor tags that intergrate with webcore. These worked well but the sensors are just tags with no display. 

The current set up uses switchbot sensors that display the temperature. These are mounted above the ‘light switches’ that control the thermostats. I am intergrating them with ifttt but hope switchbot and smartthings play nice together in the future. 

Anyway its been a work in progress but I am happy with the outcome. I sleep so much better at night with it being cold for the first 2 hours and then turning off and I like the voice control.

crxwub,1566110255,Please help - Our TV volume is randomly turning itself all the way down!,"Hello,

I really need some help. I can’t figure out what’s going on. About two months ago, at random, our TV would suddenly have the volume plummet all the way down to -0- (you can even see the vol indicator on the TV). Neither of us are using the remote when it happens, the remotes are accounted for and not being pressed accidentally. I simply cannot imagine what’s going on.

At first, it was completely random. Then, it would occasionally do it if we asked the Google Assistant a question. Now, it sometimes still does that but it also will just turn the vol down at random. The even stranger part is, that at least 3 or 4 times now, it would turn itself down while watching something, we’d rewind the video and it would repeat turning the vol down on it’s on at exactly the same place in the video. It’s driving us both crazy but my spouse even more than me. I’m the “tech geek” in the family and love smart home type stuff. I’m fairly proficient at tech stuff too but I can’t even figure out where to begin to troubleshoot this. I really need any help on what to do and where to start. It seems to mostly be when using hte Roku but then again, that’s what we use almost all the time. Here’s a rundown of what we have in our system:

Google Home (regular audio units and a couple of GA Hub display type units)  
Harmony Remote (connected wifi, not the older type)  
Philips Hue (V2 Bridge)  
SmartThings Hub V2  
Arlo Cameras  
Roku Ultra  
Fire TV 4K 1st Gen (which we really don’t use at this point)  
Nvidia Shield 2nd Gen  
Vizio P series TV (I think the 2017 model)  
Onkyo AV Receiver TX-NR626 (several years old now, obviously, by the model number, but not otherwise showing any signs of problems) - All our sound runs through this one way or another. I do currently have the Roku running straight to the TV then the TV and receiver connected via HDMI ARC for audio - simply because the TV is newer w/ 4K/HDR support (as the Roku Ultra has) and I wanted to make sure would could access those which I don’t believe will pass through the HDMI of this receiver because of its age.   
A few other units ike August lock, Ecobee thermostat, Neato vac, &amp; Sensibo but I can’t really see those effecting the sound.

I don’t know that it’s relevent but our router is near the family room TV setup so we have used wired ethernet as much as possible for connecting things to the internet. The one current exception is the Roku because for some reason, it kept losing internet connection via ethernet which resolved via wireless. I think we’re maybe starting to have issues with our stupid Netgear router (which was a high end model at the time of purchase) but I’m trying to keep it going till the new standard is ratified which I’m told is happening within 2019 to be sure the replacement will be compatible and as future-resistant as possible (figuring future-proof isn’t a reality any longer ;) ). 

I think it’s possible that my Harmony remote is starting to have issues (just seeing crazy stuff happening on the LCD screen like it’s choosing multiple things at once). BUT 1) it doesn’t actually seem to change things, 2) I’ve let that remote’s battery purposely run down completely to make sure that it’s out of the equation, and 3) you can see on the Harmony receiver unit when it’s receiving any data from either of the remotes (the little green LCD light on the receiver front blinks with each button press/command received with it blinking multiple times for volume changes) and this doesn’t happen when the random volume change happens. All that to say, I don’t think that this is coming from the Harmony system, which is the primary way that we change volume. 

We do not have Google Assistant setup to directly control volume for anything (at least, not that we’ve ever setup directly or that I know about) - this has always happened via Harmony. And yet, it seems like the GA is the most likely culprit. Ugh.
 
Please, any help regarding why is the happening, what the cause/problem is or where to even begin troubleshooting at this point would be really, really helpful. I’m completely stuck. Having seemingly ruled out Harmony and GA not (knowingly) directly controlling TV volume - what does that leave? Could this be an Onkyo bug? But if so, why would it happen in the same place on a video multiple times? So frustrated and confused. Really grateful for any ideas or advice you could share.

Pretty sure I'm leaning towards 24vDC for everything due to less voltage drop along 20'-70' lengths and the associated efficiency.   I have 250' of 16/4 CL rated speaker wire.

Both my kitchen and living room are both 12'x12' respectively.  So that is 48' of LED strip lighting for each room to a wall switch and then another 20' or so back to a whole house power supply.  Would be nice to homerun each 12' wall to the centralized power supply and do home automation with it, but gotta think of future house selling where a wall switch is needed.  I still have to research the various pro's/con's of LED strip technology and the near 70' length of voltage drop.

For the Morning Rise electric motor blinds, there are 2 windows in the living room which will be wired to a wall switch (total length would be in the 40' range from motor, switch, then central power supply).

And that is just the 24v/12v items I can think of at the moment.  Who knows what else will come to mind :)

That's the backstory.  What I'm asking about is the centralized power supply.  I really love the way DIN rails look and keep things organized, and if something goes wrong with one unit, does not take down everything since segregated (I think). However, I do not see many setups  or suggestions done this way in the USA (seems the way to go in Europe).

In short I will have the following setup:

* 4 bed house (2 up, 2 down)
   * Underfloor heating in 1 bathroom
   * Forced air Natural gas heating
* 1 tilt garage
* 1 electric gate
* 1 backgate
* 1 Gas fireplace

I would like to setup a system where the electric gate, back gate and garage are controlled via my phone (iphone) with video feeds of both the backgate and the electric gate. 

Internally I would like to replace the furnace with a newer more efficient furnace or HVAC controlled by a smart thermostat. I would also like to control air flow into each room.

My current plan is the following:

* Nest smart thermostat  
NEST CO detectors
* gogogate2  [https://www.gogogate.com/](https://www.gogogate.com/)  Ultimate for the electric gate and the garage opener.
* NEST/RING deadbolt and video doorbell for the backgate.
* Flair or Keen smart vents (not sure if either can be fully integrated with NEST to control the rooms temp automagically.

Questions:

1. Are flair/keen vents any good? I read on this forum that you can damage your forced air/HVAC if you close too many vents (backdraft??)
2. Do either Flair or Keen play nicely with NEST?
3. Should I be looking at another Master (so ecobee iso NEST)

I have thought of 2 possible solutions although I'd like some expert confirmation before I make something explode in the attempt to verify it or even worse what I thought is completely wrong.

The objective is re-use DC wires in an existing non automated system.

**Option 1:**

* The DC source is connected to a relay capable input 110VAC and output 12V (I have read people mentioning Elk Relays might work and I think so called automotive relays have similar applications).  

   * Even though I'm not sure this makes any sense as this contact will always be closed. This is the bit that confuses me. So why even put it there? Well it's doing the transformation from 12V to 110V..
   * So maybe we need to use something different here? Not a relay...
* The relay is then connected to the 110V switch
* The 110V switch is connected to the 110V device
* When the 110V closes the circuit, the 110V device is powered

**Option 2:**

* The DC source is connected to a DC switch.
* The DC switch is connected to a relay capable of input 12V input and output 110VAC

I have this feeling that my neighbor walks into my yard in the night and steals my flowers. Don't ask me why he does that, he is pretty weird.

Because I'm in Europe I can't just let my dog out, because that would be bad for me too if it would bite him.

So I figured I could at least buy some surveillance cam and maybe add a halogen with motion sensor to scare the shit out of him and have some footage of it. 

I never thought I'd need something like this so I don't really know my options. I've looked into Wyze cams, they are nice and cheap, but none of them are good for outdoor use. What would you recommend me? TIA!

I am looking for some kind of sensor that can detect a loud/abnormal noise and send a notification. I currently have a Nest camera setup, but am trying to move everything to HomeKit and self-hosted/controlled devices.

My primary use case is, we have two dogs in an apartment and if the fire alarm or building alarms were to go off it would be great to get some sort of notification (I could then check my local network camera, or run home since I work close by).

It would be awesome to find something HomeKit compatible as just about everything else in my setup is already HomeKit (lights, fans, motion sensors, etc.).  I do also have Homebridge running, so anything that works with that is fine.

Right now I have a face plate covering 2 switches and a dimmer circle knob thing. I numbered everything in the attached image to hopefully make it less confusing. 

Currently for light #1 and #2 I have smart bulbs installed. They are controlled by the dimmer circle knob. I also have a ceiling fan (#4) and attached non-smart bulb (#3) controlled by the similarly labeled switches. 

Light #1 and #2 are a really old style protruding can light that I would love to get rid of. I want to replace them with some sort of recessed LED light that is nearly flush with the ceiling. I have no real attachment to the smart bulbs so I was thinking a smart switch would be the best way to go with this. I wouldn't mind the ceiling fan/light being smart as well, but I could take it or leave it.

I have two questions for the helpful experts of this sub:  
  

1. Is there a specific smart switch you recommend given my requirements?  
  

2. Is there a video/tutorial you recommend for installing them? I just replaced some outlets with non smart outlets after watching many youtube videos, but I haven't worked up the courage to do any other electrical work, so any advice/tutorials are much appreciated.     
  

 
For what it's worth I have:  

• Google Home Mini - love being able to control the lights with voice and I use the Google Smart App a lot to manually turn them on/off right now too.  
  

• Wink2 Hub

“Due to your avid feedback, Google has created a path for current users of Nest to keep their Nest Applets functioning!

Earlier this year, Google announced a significant change to their Nest products. In their efforts to bring smart home solutions under a Google Assistant umbrella, the Works with Nest program was to be discontinued. That meant your Applets for Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, and Nest Cam would cease to function. Now, that is no longer the case.

Please refer to Nest’s post for details, but here is how to keep your Nest Applets working on IFTTT beyond August 31, 2019:

-Do not migrate your Nest account to a Google account. Migrating your Nest account will cause IFTTT and other Works with Nest integrations to be disconnected. This process is not reversible.

-Do not disconnect Nest from IFTTT after August 31st as you will not be able to reconnect it. This affects users that do not migrate their Nest accounts to a Google one.


At IFTTT, we believe that every thing works better together and we will continue to advocate for your ownership over how the products, apps, and services that fill your life can be connected, secured, and controlled.”",The-Riskiest-Biscuit,/r/homeautomation/comments/csptm3/ifttt_important_news_about_nest_on_ifttt/,9,homeautomation,10

He wants to be able to turn it on and off like regular but if I set the timer to go back on the lamp goes on even when he may not need it. Is there a solution to have the lamp not stay on all night if he forgets to turn it off but still use the pull string like normal instead of having to turn on the plug each time?,jo1655,/r/smarthome/comments/cst6zl/turning_a_lamp_off_with_smart_plug_but_on_manually/,1,smarthome,4

These would all be wired centrally to some sort of 'hub' that will then expose all the switches using Zwave to the home automation system (i still did not decide what system it will use but it will definitely have to support Zwave).

I'm running hassio on a docker and have a small collection of lights and zigbee sensors using a conbee2.  I'm still fairly new to home automation, and I really like the lighting control, but still wrapping my head around what to do with the possibilities.

So when I bought the broadlink I was hoping to repurpose an old remote to work exactly the way I want, plus be able to assign buttons to control lights, etc. The reality is, it only works via an app on my phone (or laborious home assistant programming), but you can't use IR signals as triggers. 

Two things I never want to do are be forced to control things with my phone or talk to my house. I have wireless rocker switches, but there aren't that any options out there for physical controls.

My question is what is an alternative where I can run a similar hub but locally, not dependent on the SmartThings cloud?

My goal is to have a system that is as autonomous as possible, but with a possibility of controlling it with a smart phone. Right now I'm using ESP8266s (sensors, actuators) together with a raspberry working as a MQTT broker. It works fine and cuz im not planning on having more then 15-20 connected devices, the capabilities of WiFi are ""somewhat sufficient"". But since this project is important to me in many ways I need to find the most elegant solution there is (with a grain of salt). Biggest drawbacks of this setup, that I could think of, are lower battery life, security and possible interference. 

Now comes the part where I'm kinda lost. I know about Zigbee and Z-Wave.   
The biggest problem for me with Zigbee is the price. Zigbee modules are way more expensive than ESP8266. At least the ones I found on ebay/aliexpress (some Xbee's). Maybe there are cheaper ways? And please correct me if I'm wrong, but if I got it right I will still need some MCU to take care of the sensor/actuator and the \*Zigbee module\* just takes care of data transmission (which means more money). Another problem i have with Zigbee is that it doesnt have a direct connection to the internet so setting up a connection with outside world would take more hardware, ergo more money.  
I didn't read a whole lot about Z-wave but from what i know, the same problems apply to Z-Wave.

Now the question is, what is the best way to take in developing home automation system with emphasis on price, security and stability?

ctbiva,1566360284,Long speaker cable and CAT5e run from Sonos AMP to Klipsch rock speakers,"Hi guys... wondering if there is a better solution than I’m planning before I pull hundreds of feet of speaker and CAT5e cable and thought someone here might have a suggestion. Have a small server rack in closet in middle of 3000 sq ft house built in 50s. Want to have x2 Klipsch rock speakers poolside playing from my SONOS AMP. Problem is I will have to run speaker cable from closet into attic, across to other side, drop down into crawl space under house, feed out through a ventilation grate, into a bunch of grey conduit I bought and run just above ground because of a concrete step, or I’d bury it, to the garage and then the pool. There is very little room to maneuver in the crawl space and this will require x3 guys pulling and fishing, because of all bends in the conduit and into house, up to attic and back down to AMP. I also want to use this run to power a couple of POE IP cams for my Synology while I’m at it. And the attic and crawl space are hotter than hell right now. 
Why am I going through this madness and just not using all my amazing Ubiquity gear? The garage is detached from house and not cooled and has serious moisture issues and pool chemicals and I don’t want my SONOS AMP in there basically, although that would eliminate running speaker and network cable. I also wanted a couple of PTZ Dahuas controlled and serviced with POE. 
Am I mad? Is this a stupid idea?
I have pulled and fished more than 5k network cable and have that down pretty well. The only thing connecting the garage to the house are two power lines with old ceramic style circles. Can’t piggyback off those or I would.

I built it using [Digikey's IoT Studio](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/dk-iot-studio) which helped connect the cypress board and build the mobile app using a GUI.

Once the Cypress board was provisioned I added the relay switch and tested to make sure I could control the power to the tea kettle. Then I added the temp sensor and made sure it was reading data. Then I basically combined that temp data with the relay click and a variable to turn off the power once the kettle hit a specific temperate (for example 170F for green tea, or 210 for black tea).",CaffeinatedCoding,/r/smarthome/comments/cth9fz/cypress_cyw20819_smart_tea_kettle/,2,smarthome,0

ctl6mq,1566413393,Just getting started with home automation. I have some questions,"Hi all!  I got started with home automation recently.  I installed a few ""dumb"" motion detecting switches in closets and pantries and a bathroom.  I was shocked at how much I liked them.  Now I walk into a room and I get annoyed when the lights don't turn on automatically lol.  I'm going to add a few more dumb motion detecting switches around the house in places where smart bulbs or switches would be overkill.

I have some ideas for some smart bulbs and motion detectors, but I want to make sure my idea can be done.  I'm looking at the Philips Hue smart bulbs. (I purchased some cheap Feit smart bulbs from Costco, but I don't think they can do what I want.

My idea is this.  In certain room, I want the lights to turn on when I walk in.  But I want the brightness of the light and also whether or not the light turns on at all to be dictated by the time of day.  For example, when i walk into my bedroom at noon, I want the lights and lamps to turn on at full brightness.  But if I get out of bed in the middle of the night I don't want the lights to turn on at all. And if I walk into my bathroom at 2am , I want those lights to turn on at say 30% brightness, but full brightness if its noon.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I do this with just the Philips Hue bulbs/hub and a Google Home?  Or will I need something more (SmartThings or similar)?

Also, when the Feit bulbs I have in my bedroom turn on they always go to the default color for a split second and then flash to the selected color.  I think it only does this when I flip the physical switch to power them on or off.  If I have that switch in the on position and turn them off or on via the app or google home, it does seem to go directly to the selected color. Do all bulbs do this or do more expensive bulbs just turn on to the selected color right away?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  To add to this.  I'm currently renting, so I'm trying to avoid smart switches when possible.  Even if its a bit more expensive to get extra smart bulbs when a switch would do the trick.  When I move out of this place, I can take the bulbs with, but removing and reinstalling the old dumb switches would be a big hassle.",uhohmomspaghetti,/r/homeautomation/comments/ctl6mq/just_getting_started_with_home_automation_i_have/,0,homeautomation,5
ctlt71,1566416093,How to piece together a hub/infrastructure?,"So, I've got a few things and starting to dip my toes in, and I'm wondering what the right next purchases to make are.  A few facts:

* I'm not an apple guy
* I'm a software engineer, and have plenty of resources to either custom code things or piece things together, including plenty of linux experience and existing infrastructure.
* I very much prefer local access, and api driven access.  I'd prefer coding things, and text based configuration than guis, for automation/documentation purposes
* I will have some disparate data sources (zigbee, wifi, SDR readings of thermometers and utility meters), and a desire to do time-series monitoring of all of these types of things, in arbitrary combinations, in things like prometheus or influxdb. (Example: A chart showing the runtime of my refigerator over the past hour/week/month, with accompanying wattage consumption).  I want to use tools for longitudinal data collection, not just triggering of things.
* Alexa is my voice tool of choice
* Web portal for phone/computer access is fine.  Integration with mobile apps is fine, but a mobile-first web interface might also be ok?
* I have a 24/7 server in house, with the ability to run whatever, virtualized, containerized, with sufficient means to provide secure external access.

My initial thought is ""just get a smartthings, piece it together with &lt;something&gt; running on the server, and away I go""

Given that I care a lot about local access (I have a honeywell wifi thermostat that only supports web access and doing monitoring of it is a pain), is smartthings the right hub to get to bridge zigbee/zwave to wifi? What about zigbee/zwave dongles to connect directly to a machine instead?  I have no existing zigbee or zwave infrastructure, so i'm able to commit to a standard, at least to get started.

Is looking at using SDR to implement zwave/zigbee something reasonable? Strikes me as ""no, and too expensive"" since I'd care about transmit and receiver, and SDR things on the transmit side seem to get pretty pricey pretty quickly.  

What type of software should I be looking to run to support the types of things I'm looking for?  Is Home Assistant the clear choice here, or should I be looking at other things.  OpenHAB?

I'm *somewhat* sensitive to power consumption.  One of my goals of this is to reduce power consumption of things in house by being smarter/better informed. if I have to run an additional 100+ watts of bridges/converters/radios/whatever to get observability, I'm less enthused.  The 24/7 server, maybe with an extra raspberry pi or 2, should be able to be leveraged here if possible.

Pretty rambling and vague because I don't have a clear picture yet, hopefully this is enough information to get some suggestions for what the backend and frontend of my infrastructure should look like.",bryanalves,/r/homeautomation/comments/ctlt71/how_to_piece_together_a_hubinfrastructure/,6,homeautomation,9

I've been doing research, and this is what I'm thinking so far: 
   
Get an 8 channel amp, [like this Russound] and set it to ""bus"".   
Get a streaming adapter like a Sonos Connect, but probably Chromecast audio and connect it to the amp.    

This should allow them to stream from Google Play to the CCA, and control the volume from their phone, does that all look right?",Jim_E_Hat,/r/homeautomation/comments/ctnc4e/whole_house_audio_question/,1,homeautomation,7

cto0qc,1566425698,Need help mounting a tablet to my fridge.

It works great! The only thing I'm not super keen on is how far out it sticks. From the fridge to the back of the tablet is easily 6-7 inches. The fridge is next to a high-traffic area, so the tablet needs to stay relatively high so you don't smack into it when you walk by.

So, I'm out looking for other solution. Budget is &lt;$20. 

What I'm envisioning is a 3-inch plastic disc with a very strong 3M sticky tape on one side and rare earth magnets on the other. This way, I stick the disc to the back of the tablet and BAM, right to the fridge it goes. No additional mount necessary, and it can be at a height that has a high WAF. Current tablet itself and features have a high WAF. Its height, not-so-much.

Nothing I've searched for even comes close here. Most of the tablet mounts on Amazon are similar to the AboveTEK one I have, which all either stick out or have the weird flexible arm. 

Charging is no issue. the cable runs mostly flush with the wall until it slides along to meet the tablet.

Is there some other industry that uses something like this that I should be looking for? So many places offer just straight magnets. I suppose in desperation I could 3M or glue them to the tablet or case, but then I run into the issue my very first fridge tablet had, which was a 3AM crash to the ground with a broken screen.

I need some advice.  I am looking for a contact sensor (preferably zwave and works with smartthings and IFTTT) that I would be able to wire up to my mailbox.

cu7i0h,1566526694,Best dimmer switch (I have neutral wires)?,"I have a GE paddle dimmer, and I don’t like the dimming mechanism on the physical switch. It’s too fast - gets too bright or too dim too quickly. We’re frequently overshooting it (I’m better now, but wife and guests have problems). I have some automations, but it’s a light that is used very often, so the physical switch still is used a lot, and everyone complains about the switch. 

**Should I get the Lutron Caseta dimmers?** I don’t mind how they look, but i wonder how good they’ll be relative to their high price tag. I think I’ve heard they can have a slight delay due to no neutral wire. And since  I have neutrals, I feel like I don’t even need one of the Caseta’s biggest selling points. 

If I’m better off with GE, **what about Zooz?** And then is the Zooz s2 better/worth the extra $? Or some other option?

cu83jg,1566530000,The system I prewired for is discontinued!,"Problem:  

I recently was informed that the Leviton Omni system I was planning to use was discontinued.  Now I need to find a new system that does it all.



Back story:

I had a small side business doing some home theater, audio, security, and automation stuff, but over the past year basically haven’t done much of it since I had to focus on my main career.  

I am also in the process of building my own home, it has been a 2.5 year build - not because it’s some elaborate 30,000 sq ft house, but because I’m doing a lot of it myself!

I very extensively prewired my home for lighting control including scene controllers, (11) glass break sensors, (5) motion detectors, (4) perimeter door contacts, (2) garage door contacts, (7) interior door contacts, (4) security camera locations (POE), (1) water sensor, (9) zones of audio, 7.1 surround sound in theater with projector, among countless POE tablet locations, data/TV locations, etc.

I have already purchased about (20) Leviton WiFi switches/dimmers and had them installed, then I contacted one of my old suppliers about ordering the Omni system, which is supposedly discontinued.

I also have (3) Honeywell smart stats, (2) Access points with supporting hardware and a big POE switch.


Goals:

- One app to control all (I already foresee having to give up on this, as I’m guessing theater control will have to be separate)
- Full security system which can trigger automation
- Lighting control with scene control options (example: between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. the bathroom lights only turn on to 50%)
- Video doorbell
- Surveillance camera system that can be viewed in the app in real time
- Integration with my (3) Honeywell thermostats
- Probably a million other things that I won’t think about until I’m trying to program the system

What do you guys suggest!?  I can probably get my hands on RTI stuff, but would have to jump through some hoops, aside from that... I’m a bit lost.  I would really rather not pay someone else to do it for me, considering I used to do this stuff myself....",JM0160,/r/homeautomation/comments/cu83jg/the_system_i_prewired_for_is_discontinued/,1,homeautomation,7

Will consider if you tell me this is never a problem with certain locks.

Don't really want a smart lock either to be honest, I have no real need for it, and digital security is impossibly hard, I very much doubt any of these companies is spending serious money on hackathons or security audits, although again, may be willing to reconsider.

What I really want, and I cannot seem to find, is more of a simple digital lock. No wifi, no bluetooth, ideally a digital keypad and NFC/RFID dongle. So I can approach door, wave my key dongle ( or phone NFC if possible) and it will open, and for the 1/1000 times i forget my keys and mobile, i can just use the keypad. Does anything like this exist? I dont want to have to enter a code everytime, seems like it would take longer than just using a key, and RFID seems like the best option.

As the Echo Input is currently down to £19.99, I thought I'd bag myself one in the hope that I can use it in the following scenario (bear with me)...

I have a Yamaha AV Receiver in the living room, connected to a sub and 5 speakers.

Next door (in my office), I have a Harmony hub, that is used in conjunction with my old Pioneed received to play XBOX and stream music via the Echo Input that is connected to it.

So far so good...

Now, I only use one of the IRs that came with the hub, so what I'm thinking is connecting the second IR and running it into the living room, so that it can control the Yamaha receiver.

Then, I'll create a Harmony activity to play music in the ""Living Room"" in the hope that once I've configured it, I can tell Alexa to play &lt;whatever&gt; in the Living room and she will talk to the Harmony and the Harmony will blast out via the IR and turn on the receiver and switch it to the relevant input to play the music through the 5.1 speakers.

**I have:**

\- MyQ Chamberlain Smart Garage Door Opener

\- Nest 3rd Gen Thermostat w/ Temperature Sensor

\- Google Wifi 3 Pack

\- 2 Pack Wi-Fi Smart Plug (came with Google Wifi)

\- Google Home Hub

\- Google Home Mini

\- Wyze Motion Sensors/Door Sensors

\- August Smart Lock Pro

\- SwitchBot

\- Koogeek LED Strip Lights

I am looking to install automated blinds. There are a lot of options out there and I was hoping some of you can share your experiences.

I am looking for something that connects into either the google home or the alexa eco system. 

Preferably not super expensive. I know Ikea is coming out with their smart blinds October first at a reasonable price point. But even then if you are looking to do the entire house you are still getting close to 1500 - 2000 dollar. So far I haven't found anything that either converts or starts out as smart blinds for a doable price.

I'm trying to create my own home alarm system (based around home assistant). The big stumbling block I have is around turning the alarm on. I think a remote keyfob probably makes the most sense for this.

Ideally it would work in a range of around 100m (I'm thinking something 433 based)

It also needs to be secure (some sort of rolling code)

I'm trying to automate my daughter's bedtime so my wife can either talk to Alexa/Google Mini or press a button on her phone to launch a Siri Shortcut (That's the easy bit) which will then start a custom animation starting at 50% brightness transitioning through various colours gradually reducing in brightness to say 10% and after half an hour of the process starting the light will switch off.

I've managed to kind of get the effect going using a standard 'Colorloop' animation start off with IFTTT however if we want to override it and switch the light off, change the brightness etc it just reverts to 100% brightness and carries on, so that is a no go.

I've looked at numerous apps which support animations such as u/iconnecthue and have set my own up which is triggered via a long press on a dimmer switch. However it is limited on reducing brightness over time, switching off at a set time or being triggered by IFTTT etc. 

So at the moment we hold press the dimmer to trigger the animation and at the same time set a timer which then automatically turns the light off after half an hour.

I'm leaning towards going into the TP-Link ecosystem because they meet both these categories.

However, ""Smart Life"" (Tuya) is a backend ecosystem that's been making strides, but I'm not finding very many matching switches between Dimmer with Buttons and modern light switches.

I looked at Insteon, Leviton, GE, Lutron, Inovelli, and WeMo. So far, TP-Link and individual Smart Life switches are meeting both categories above.

This is going to be the start of our _light switch_ ecosystem. I'm thinking ahead and continuity is important.

Admittedly, I'm leaning towards Smart Life due to the sheer verity. I'm hesitant as Tuya is a Chinese company, and unfortunately, we have to take anything from there with a grain of salt (quality and privacy).

Right now my plan is to use a Google Home Mini, connected to some stereo speakers, along with some smart RGB strips, maybe a smart light bulb, and possibly even something to control the window shade.

I'm on the newer side of this so I thought I'd ask for some guidance from people more experienced, If you had full control over tech-ing out your dorm room what would you do.

After all, it's just a box full of switches, but I still wanted to share.  And, yes I know, it's a little messy.  I'm working on bundling my wires.  I'm also adding a gesture board to it so I can control it without sticking my hands in the box.  It replaced an Intermatic timer.  It uses DIN rail components which makes it nice to move stuff around and refactor until I got it the way I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

It controls my pump, heater, spa blower, lights (on/off/programs), pool cleaner.  Eventually I'll get the actuators that turn valves so I can flip from Pool to SPA mode automatically as well but it'll require some plumbing as I'll have to automate bypassing my filter too.

It tracks my PSI &amp; pump current.  I want to start logging temperature as well.

Can control things on a schedule and override with a webpage that displays in my iphone/ipad/computer.

I assume if I install it and the light is off with the switch position being set to off, then a Z-Wave command switches it on the switch is still physically in the off position. And to turn the light off manually, you have to move the switch to the on position. Is that correct?

&amp;#x200B;

I have some specific queries too such as.

How will this work alongside my existing Hive Active Heating Thermostat? Do they compliment each other or collide? 

If I have a TRV in all rooms, will setting the temp on the Hive thermostat adjust the baseline temperature for all rooms or will it just register as a control for the room it sits in?

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to know is how much do wifi and bluetooth signals really effect Zigbee devices? I live in downtown San Francisco where there are a crapton of wifi networks and bluetooth devices surrounding my location. From what I've read, both Zigbee and Zwave devices will create their own mesh networks but I'm concerned about interference causing problems with Zigbee devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone share their experiences? So far I only have the Hubitat and one Samsung water sensor on order. I was looking at devices and Zigbee stuff seems to be way cheaper than Zwave Plus. If the Zigbee mesh is strong enough to resist interference, I'd probably go that way because of budget - I'm just worried that all the 2.4ghz signals in the area would stop/delay a notification from a Zigbee water sensor. I know Hubitat will let you change the Zigbee channel but the spectrum is pretty crowded here.

cvtq4j,1566851760,Vivint honest review,"&amp;#x200B;

I am not a sales person, I have vivint and wanted to give an honest review. The reviews here almost scared me away completely but now I have vivint and thus far am pretty happy.

Technology:

The best part of Vivint. We have the basic package (Sky panel included) and doorbell camera. The doorbell camera never lags. We had the ring pro and found this to be far superior. The images are clear. I do wish it had better night vision but it is what it is. The sky panel is super sleek and easy to use. The app is easy to navigate. Our alarm went off (through us testing it) and vivint responded in under a second to make sure we were ok. Alarm is nice and loud.

We've never experienced any issues with the technology. Chalk it up to great wifi or a good installation maybe. Equipment is top notch.

The contract:

everything outlined by the ""horror"" stories were clearly explained to us when we signed the contract. 5 year contract unless you pay the equipment off early (then you go month to month). equipment is useless without the professional monitoring. You will pay a $129 to have the equipment moved.

staff:

The only problems we ever encountered were with the staff who you work there when you call in. Some are rude, some have no idea what theyre talking about. Others are actually great and make everything a breeze.

we were actually scared of these reviews so we canceled in the 3 day grace period with zero problems. we switched to ring which was garbage!! We then switched back and couldn't be happier. Our equipment was actually the same price as what we paid at ring. The only difference is the monitoring is $30 more a month.

cvtya8,1566852779,Google Home with playlists,"Hello! I'm pretty new to the home automation scene; we have had a Google Home Hub for a little bit but recently picked up some Home Minis to use as alarm clocks in our kids' rooms.

They are named Kid1 Room and Kid2 Room. I would like to use these as alarm clocks to play custom curated Spotify playlists as their alarm clocks each morning as a scueduled routine. But also when I tell the minis to ""Wake up Kid."" Also, as an added bonus, I want to tell my phone to ""Wake up Kid"" and have the routine play on the correct mini.

I've tried putting together a routine that does this, but I can't seem to get it to work.

I have the keyphrase as ""Wake up Kid1"" and the routine is ""shuffle Kid1 playlist on Kid1 Room."" I used the ""on Kid1 Room"" command so I could use my phone's assistant and have the routine kick over to Kid1 Room, that way I can manually trigger the routine from anywhere in the house, or let the scheduled routine run at the set time.

But, the Kid1 playlist never plays, even if I trigger it from the mini itself rather than my phone. Instead, I get ""here's a Spotify station based on your Kid1 playlist."" It doesn't actually play my customized playlist. Yet, when I tell my phone ""shuffle Kid1 playlist"" it works just fine (on the phone only).

Is this related to me having a free Spotify account vs a premium account? Seems weird if that's the case; it's the exact same command so why would it matter if it's free and works on my phone?

I am doing some work on my home and looking to add an outdoor transformer for some low voltage lights.  Rather than blindly spend $175 on the one my supplier recommended, I wanted to look into the smart home options, but it seems the only low voltage smart transformer I can find is the new offering from Ring.

I also wanted to use this as a gateway for starting to setup my home automation.  Currently were an Apple household, but I am aware of HomeKit's limitations.  I have read reviews on Wink and SmartThings and am leaning towards SmartThings.  I am in the IT field by day but I really (cannot stress this enough) do not want something I have to tinker with or use RaspberryPi or anything like that.  I would like basic functionality, scenes, the ability to scale to additional devices, all from my phone.  Pretty easy, right?  Any reason SmartThings wouldn't be able to do that?

Regarding my outdoor lighting, I am going to have lighting on 2 different decks, so a multi-zone system would be great, but I haven't had any luck finding anything that would be smart-home enabled.

cw5rlp,1566918578,Is a smart lock worth it in a condo?,"Hi, so I just bought a condo and I was looking into switching locks. I was offered to either keep the traditional double lock or install a yale smart lock. Here's the thing, the original lock was a combination of a deadbolt and a handle lock. I am not sure what it is called but both the handle and deadbolt are controlled by the same key hole and the door autolocks when you leave the apartment. If I were to install the yale they would cut a hole in the door and install the lock above the current deadbolt. I would essentially have 2 locks but the original double lock would just be not in use. This just seems a bit silly to me but I am not sure how convenient the smart lock is. Money is not an issue but I want to know if it is worth a $300 additional. The condo is relatively high end so there is always a front desk person who can let people in if needed.

cw7onm,1566927143,Question for Neato Botvac owners,"I recently purchased the D7, working great but some minor things. I mapped my apartment, though when mapping it didnt complete the bathroom (not sure if it even went in there). Fortunately this isnt an issue as everytime I set my bot to clean my floor, it goes in there anyways. But it typically skips one or two small areas (a few square ft, behind couch, in between furniture). Today it hit all the small areas, but it skipped my entryway (it usually gets this) which is about 3 ft by 6 ft. This isn't a bit deal since I can use zone cleaning to get the spots it misses, but it definitely leaves something to be desired. Is this normal?

The other annoying thing is if I press stop during the run, it does stop. But when I start it back up it will clean without no go lines. But it doesnt give me the option to return it to dock. It says it can shortly after the bot finds where it is, but I've tried several times after waiting 15 or so minutes and it didnt work. Maybe I should wait longer?

Edit: to add another problem, I just sent it to zone clean and somehow the robot paused. And when I click resume it doesn't actually resume.

cwb2np,1566942207,"""Hey Google, tell Roborock to clean my living room""","As the experiment with Google Home Local SDK , I have implemented extended integration of Roborock vacuum with Google Assistant. Existing Xiaomi implementation contains only basic start/stop/pause commands.

What is already implemented:
- Zone/room cleaning
  ""Clean my kitchen""
- Location
  ""Where is my vacuum cleaner?""
- Selection of suction mode: low, balanced, high, turbo and mopping
  ""Set Roborock mode to balanced""
- Default modes for zones
  Eg High suction power in the kitchen
- Go to target point (for service)
 
Local SDK allows not to use Xiaomi cloud, all communication occurs locally.
The ""skill"" is not published and currently in stage “works for me”, i was able to ensure operation on my devices (Google Home + Roborock S5 EU) for a week and pretty happy with results.

As the Roborock and smart automation enthusiast I'm looking for people who are interested in using, testing and extending the application

What need to be improved:
0) it tested only on my S5 other models should work ( as soon as they have saved map and zone cleaning )

1) Google associates verbs to device type, currently the device is ""vacuum"" so it handles ""clean"" and ""vacuum"" commands, but not ""mop"". It is possible to create second device of ""mop"" type, but it's a bad design

2) it is a strict match for names and number of synonyms is restricted by Google. The list of mode names need to be created and sent to Google as a feature request.
2.1) It is only English language now, translation to other languages would be nice to have.

3) Local SDK is in beta and at this moment does not support UDP response, so it is not possible to get current status of the device

4) For token extraction and zone positions I am using Android app from Flole, probably it could be done in the web application.

Well didint take long to realize that I would need way more than one 5 meter reel. Essentially I need about 46feet (approx) of LED light strips to wrap the entire bedroom ceiling perimiter. I dont mind using this solo 5m reel for another project and ordering another longer 15m set. I get that it would still be receiving 3 x 5 meter reels but at least I would be ordering the same 3 reels/brand/make/specs etc...

Now to install three 5m reels is what I'm feeling ULTRA challenged with. All of the install demos/advice I'm seeing online are demonstrating how to connect each reel to the same controller/splitter thing that comes with the reel. This almost forces me to begin all three 5meter reels around the same ceiling location since all 3 must be directly plugged into controller power thing. What I REALLY want to do is connnect all 3 reels back to back to back BUT I'm learning that this way, the 2nd and 3rd strips can emmit dimmer light due to being further away from the power supply? (voltage attenuation??) is there a way around this? Ideally I want one power supply plugged into wall socket and then up the wall to the ceiling and then begin my to wrap the bedroom from there, and finish where I started. I would like this as simple as possible! She is super discouraged because of these challenges.

For three 5m reels, is there not a way to connect the first one to a power supply that is specced good enough to handle three 5m strips, then connect the send reel to the end of the first one and then the third one to the end of the second one? It seems like Im always being instructed to connect the first strip to power supply, then second strip to same power supply but this one now is forced to have super long wiring since your still starting the connection at the same power supply but you need to place that strip 5 meters into the run, after/past the first 5m strip. So now I have to run an additional long wire along the top of the ceiling next the the first 5m strip just to get power to the second strip that starts at the 5 meter mark? thats just silly and so much extra wire length.

cwpi74,1567020298,Robot vacuum decision help! (Especially people with pets!),"I bought a roomba 960 about a month ago and as someone with 4 cats it is WONDERFUL. But, while I like it, there are a few things that bother me.

Pros:
- cleans up pet hair and litter like a boss
- goes back to its base for charging most of the time

Cons:
- corners and edges are still dirty.
- can’t assign areas to clean so if I schedule a cleaning in the app, I have to make sure the whole house is safe to run it
- sometimes doesn’t go back to base if it runs low during a job so I have to find where the hell it went and then put it there manually
- I have to empty the bin mid-clean about every other job which means I can’t always schedule it to vacuum while I’m at work and such

The upgraded models with the room mapping and bin emptying features sound super tempting. 

We have a 3br/2ba house with 2 hallways, a big living room, and a kitchen, so it DOES cover a lot of ground before I have to empty the bin, but because we have 4 cats (and therefore 4 litter boxes) I still have to and it feels like an impediment optimization wise.

Has anyone upgraded from the 970 to the i7+ or the s9+? Is it worth double the price? (Keep in mind I’ll be running it at least every other day, ideally more, so in my head it feels like it could be worth it?) 

Or is there another brand with similar features I should shift to instead?

&gt;  
&gt;**We  are seeking a buyer for our assets, and as part of that process hope to  find a buyer who will keep the Smart Alert network up and running.  If  we find such a buyer, your service may continue and if it does, it will  be according to new terms of service set by the new owner.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**If  we cannot find a buyer with an interest in maintaining the Smart Alert  network, we will have no choice but to shut the Smart Alert network down  as we wind down the operations of the company.**    
&gt;  
&gt;**Just  in case we don’t succeed in finding a buyer, this will serve as advance  notice of the possible shutdown of the Smart Alert network.**

&gt;  
&gt;**Unfortunately,  if the Smart Alert Network is shut down, your Leeo Smart Alert will no  longer function with the iOS/Android app.  The apps must have the  network to function. We expect the color of your Smart Alert to turn  white. You will still be able to physically adjust the light level via  the ring on the device.  But you will not receive alerts on your phone,  and you will not be able to control the device with your phone as the  apps will no longer be networked to your device.**

I've seen the amazon review, which admittedly are not great, but I figured it was just end user issues give the price of this thing.  Surely for $200 it can at least stably stay connected to a network right?   I've noticed on occasion it will connect w/ 5GHz and other times 2.4GHz but right now on 2.4 my RSSI is -59 dBm but it'll vary up to about -62 which is fine but shitty given it's about 20' from my very nice long range AP.   I do see this thing has a power save enabled option in my unifi controller so I may look into that but I highly doubt that's the issue.  Does anyone else use one of these, has it been ok? Perhaps I have a bad device.  It did  an update (Once I finally got it to connect) so I have to believe it's on the latest firmware.  The odd thing is even when it isn't replying to pings the green light stays solid green which also baffles me.

Overall i'm fairly disappointed in this thing.  They also advertise it working w/ google home and in reality you have to use IFTTT which has been as unreliable given this thing won't stay connected.  One time while testing it processed the command about 7 minutes after I asked my home mini to lower a screen.  Quality stuff...

When the thing is actually on my network IFTTT does work so I know everything is good there.  I moved the mylink device to within 6"" of my AP (getting a -24 dBm RSSI LOL) and it still disconnects.  I'm going to take one of these onsite to a client today and test it on their LAN while I'm there to see if perhaps something is wreaking havoc on these things.  

Is there a hardware/software alternative to this hunk O' crap?

I currently run a mix of Smartlink and eWelink products around my home with both integrated to Google Home.
Ideally any new lock I find can be integrated into my existing setup.

I'm kinda new in home automation and I'm looking to replace all the bulbs in my house with WiFi RGB bulbs. The thing is, smart lamps and switches are always 'on'. They're continuously connected to power unlike normal bulbs, where a physical switch breaks the circuit. 

I'm a little bit worried that some of these things will catch fire when I'm not home. Nowadays there are cheap smart bulbs available everywhere. A store in my country that's known for cheap accessories for your house (home decorations and cheap stuff for living, from deodorant to plastic food containers etc.) started to sell a series of smart devices, like remotes, sensors and several bulbs for like 8 eur each and it seems really a good deal. They work with the LSC smart home app, but also with some other app (forgot the name) that also supports Yeelights. 

My question is: are these smart lamps more likely to catch fire than usual LED bulbs, and does the price make any difference? How are smart devices secured from burning trough?

cx5wxy,1567108291,Wireless switches for new construction?," Hello,

I'm  working on the design for a new construction. I'm considering the use  of wireless switches rather hard wired switches. Do you guys have any  opinion/experience with such system deployed for a whole house? I've looked at a few systems but  right now my preference is going toward Hue.

I currently use a variety of smart dimmer in my home but my favorite one is also Hue.

Advantages:

1. A lot less materials are needed since I can just run a single wire for all the  light fixtures inside the home.
2. A lot less labor is needed since I wouldn't need to install 12 hard wired switches.
3. I can place switches anywhere and add/remove switches as needed.
4. Floor lamp and ceiling lamps can equally be combined in groups allowing for a more flexible system
5. All lights can be connected to a single breaker
6. Hue  lights have temperature adjustment which is absolutely marvelous once  you are use to it, you wish all the lights in your house would be like  that.
7. All lights will be connectable with Alexa.
8. It's fairly affordable, I would be able to get all fixtures and bulbs for a 2bd/2bath 1000sqft home for less than $2k.

Inconvenients:

1. I'm locked into what choices Hue offers. Their selection is good now but who knows if that will become an issue in the future.
2. Retrofit to wired switches if needed would be a very expensive process.
3. I will need to replace batteries in all the switches every couple of years.

Bonus question: if I expand the room with more Hue light bulbs, like the one hanging in the window, am I able to pair that with the same physical Hue dimmer remote as the Adore, so that they follow each other or do I either need a separate remote or start building a real hue network by expanding it with a hub.

Hey Robot Vacuum owners!  
 

I'm a product design student and I'm working on a project for robot vacuums and would love it if you could help me with some research!  
 

This activity is called a ‘card sort’ and it helps me to understand how you prioritize your needs regarding your robot vacuum. It should take you between 6-10 minutes to complete. There are three ‘decks’ of cards that we need you to sort for us in order of importance / priority. Each activity has a short description that will help you understand how to prioritize them.  
 

Card Sorts for \*Newer-Model\* Owners  
 

Newer models include any robot vacuum with wifi connectivity or smart mapping features. They typically pair with a companion app on your phone and steer themselves with a level of awareness by scanning and mapping their environments. If this sounds like your robot then please complete all 3 of these sorts for us!

They’re also typically ugly and when they are visible occupy a prominent spot on the wall offering almost no useful functionality. Smart thermostats offer a marginal improvement, making them a bit more aesthetically pleasing, working around bad placement in the house by offering remote control and occasionally remote sensors, with a nicer UI and occasionally a voice assistant built in (nonetheless still less useful because of the awkward placement of much thermostat hookup wiring)

Why does nobody (or do they?) offer mini remote thermostat modules that can live near the easy wiring spots on the heat pump or furnace, and then a central thermostat control panel that can hook up to multiple control modules and thus be aware of multiple zones? It seems like a cheaper, better design allowing you to put the control panel somewhere actually useful and not have to run awkward wiring through the house to make it work.",mortgagecurious,/r/homeautomation/comments/cxxv1q/the_thermostat_industry_feels_stuck_in_the_past/,1,homeautomation,12

I have a lot of windows and would prefer to use wired window switches b/c they are less expensive but mainly b/c they are a good bit smaller.

I would like to have the system monitored if i want too but i dont want a contract type of service or would be interested in self monitoring but i dont know much about that as i just saw this today.

I would like the ability to see status on my phone etc.

The ability to monitor a smoke detector would be good as well as a motion detector too.

I have been looking at the Qolsys IQ Panel 2 Plus as well as the DSC power series neo.  I have recently been told DSC may not be the best route to do due to some encryption with DSC.  What has everyone here had success with?

I would like to have at least one main panel touch panel.
