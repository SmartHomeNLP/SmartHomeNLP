e4blvu,1575178989,Beginner Wanting a Smart Ceiling Fan Setup,"Hello! I want to finally start making my home smart, and I decided my first smart object would be a ceiling fan with dimmable lights to replace a crappy dome light I have in my living room.

This does not seem to be an intuitive place to start, but I'm committed now.

Please sanity check my understanding of what I need to do?

1. Pick an ecosystem and get its hub. SmartThings looks very developed and stable, so I want that.
2. Get a regular old fan. And dimmable bulbs if it doesn't come with them. Thinking about [this guy](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hunter-Oakhurst-52-in-LED-Indoor-Low-Profile-Brushed-Nickel-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit-52125/300593307).
3. Get a smart dimmer switch, namely [this GE one](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RRD92T8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1).
4. Get a smart fan control switch; may as well stick [with GE](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XTKQTTV/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2).
5. Pay an electrician for once instead of standing on a ladder, swearing because I dropped a screw again and my arms are tired.
6. Do whatever I need to do to sync the switches with the hub and the hub with my phone. I assume this isn't that hard.

I am... moderately skilled with tech and DIY, but I have never felt as much like my grandma as I have trying to figure all this out. **Will all these parts work together?** And is it the most straightforward way? I've seen threads about rewiring stuff inside the light fixture, but that can't be necessary, right? Would there be any reason to go for smart bulbs instead of the switch? I wouldn't guess so, since a ceiling fan has \~3 bulbs.

I've installed the app, signed up for a Lenovo Link ID, plugged in the bulb and it flashes as expected.

I have a Netgear D7000v2 that is broadcasting two separate SSIDs (ssid: mywifiname, 5ghz; ssid: mywifiname-2.4ghz, 2.4ghz) 2.4ghz and 5ghz network - but isn't this fairly standard?

When I look at the Philips hue platform (lights + hub + app) I see couple of opportunities that pop in my head. But I wanted to make sure I understand completely the current Interfaces that the platform offers.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Can I send messages to the Hub and \*Pretend\* I'm the Phone App? In other words, is there a way (MQTT?) to send packages to the hub? 

2) If I create my own light (ie.: Led + Arduino), how do I tell my Hub that I'm a 'Philip Hue'? Is there somewhere the original Firmware that are today in the bulbs? Do we know how the Hub 'record' a device? 

3) Is there a way to specify how a 'light' (let's assume something that Philips never developed, ie.: a RGBW strip) should be displayed on the APP ? (In this case maybe I'd like to see two sliders (one to control the RGB part of it and one for the W component, or maybe just a RGB where the W is tuned accordingly).

e4nkfp,1575233735,Options for a switch with no neutral wire to a ceiling fan with an A15 LED bulb of max 6.5 watts.,"Discovered yesterday that the light switches in two of my bedrooms have no neutral wire in the gang box. Have been going the TP-Link Kasa route with the switches. But will have to change course.


Switches in both rooms power a ceiling fan that currently has a 5.5 watt LED bulb installed. Max rated for a 6.5 watt LED bulb. The power to the ceiling fan itself is wired hot. Controlled only by the chain. Switch only controls the light.


Trying to decide between the following options:  

* Lutron Caseta  
* Insteon  
* Inovelli  
* Aeotec/Fibaro Dimmer  

Less desirable options:  

* Put in an A19 smart bulb and leave off the cover.  
* Have an electrician run the neutral wire to both gang boxes.  


My primary concern is having to possibly wire a bypass to a ceiling fan, as the load is only 5.5 watts. Since all of these ceiling fans have wattage limiters already, I'm not sure how that would work.


Does anyone have any experience with a non neutral setup using a ceiling fan with a low load? My preference is an option where I can use a standard z-wave hub. But if the Lutron or Insteon are known to work without the bypass, then I would go that direction because I would not have to mess with the ceiling fan wiring.

I know many people are still content with wink but they appear to be going down and I’d rather move to a solution that I think will be around for the foreseeable future. 

Wife and I have a condo about 2 hours from our primary residence located in a desirable ski resort. As such, we rent it out when we’re not using it. Currently we use Wink to control our Schlage lock. For all of its downsides, the thing I love about wink (and the most important functionality for us) is the ability to add and remove door codes for renters. 

I’ve been trying to research but in all honestly am a bit overwhelmed with information overload. Seems like smart things is a good option but not sure how adding codes works (seemed like writing code was involved). Understanding that the main functionality we need to have is the ability to remotely control the ability to add/remove door codes, can anyone give me advice on a good option to replace wink?

Here's my situation:

I have all of my home automation and security system (konnected) based around Smartthings. I use ActionTiles to control everything via a few wall mounted tablets. I'm loving this setup...and so does my wife so bonus points for simplicity. :) We also have several Echos around the house.

I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2NgA8qYcFI&amp;feature=youtu.be) on using Arduino and an ESP board to connect an old Roomba to HomeAssistant. This is almost everything that I want...except I'm not running HA. (I dabbled with it early on in my home automation pursuits, but found it a little cumbersome for my needs)

My main question(s)...

Can I connect my old roomba via a ESP or NodeMCU board (I have several laying around) to my Smartthings/ActionTiles setup? If so, how?

Please ask me any questions. I'm an open book.

Maybe I am missing something but I have searched far and wide, this is my last hope before discarding them.

TLDR;Does anyone have any idea on how to re-flash to the original firmware via OTA. (1Mb in size)

Update 1:

Looks like the original firmware cannot fit back on the bulb, need to look more into this.I will revert to minimal firmware with OTA and try my luck again.

Update 2:

After researching abit I came across esptool.py which uses serial to flash. It looks like it also compresses the bin file and erasers the memory before flashing. As I am not willing to open the bulb and do this, this is where the story ends. I would not feel safe giving these to my parents as they could become fire hazards in the future.

Well at least you don’t have to reach for the remote I say! *my inner laziness tinging with joy*

Only downside is that you’d have to power on the smart plug and then the TV, to actually be able to use the TV. So you can say this is pretty dumb. Might be useful to some though.

&amp;#x200B;

I generally control most of my home via my phone and or google nest, however this is cumbersome for guests and family. I have some old hardware lying around in the form of tablets/phones and thought about converting one of these, or multiples into control interfaces with large buttons that people can simply press to control things like lights/blinds etc.

The common stuff people would want to do generally.

I have seen various options on my searches, but they either require a server to run on a pi at a minimum or a large money sum to run the server variant to be able to do this. I am hoping people here have done similar things and can point me in the right direction!

Many thanks

I have been following along on the sub for a month or so now and am slowly learning about the options available (and the issues people are having). I was hoping you could assist me in making an informed decision.

I recently purchased a home (built in ~1975, however most rooms have been renovated). I currently have the following vision:

•	Smart Lock (Front Door, Back Door, Garage)
      
     o	I saw U Bolt ultraloqs which looked promising for the features I will need
              
             	FOB, phone access

•	Cameras (2 to start on each door)

•	Water Sensors (3 – dishwasher &amp; both upstairs bathrooms)

•	Smart Light Switches (FUTURE)

We own android phones and will typically stick with that over apple products.

I understand I will need a hub. I am tech savy (but wont be able to write much code).

What should I use as my hub?
What locks do you recommend?
What cameras will work with the aforementioned hub?
Where should I get water sensors?

Any 32ft kits that are HUE bridge compatible come to mind?

If I’m stuck with 16ft kit options, can I get a splitter and an additional 16ft spool?

e56jee,1575324839,Wifi low voltage switch for outdoor use,"I have a low volatge outdoor lighting setup.  Basically a transformer which converts AC to 12-15V DC (I actually haven't tested it with a voltometer yet, but that's what the lights support and they haven't caught on fire yet) and 2 pairs of wire to light up the 2 zones of my yard.  It obviously has power all the time to the transformer, so no battery solutions please.

What is the preferred device these days that:

1. Uses wifi (I have Zwave but I think range is going to be an issue)
2. Local control, no cloud
3. Preferably can control 2 outputs, but if it's a good product, having to use 2 is doable.
4. Is suitable for outdoors.  There currently isn't any weatherproof box to put it in, but I could create a weatherproof box for it, or pack it in silicone or something.  But if there was something already waterproofed, that would be a bonus.
5. Dimmable ?  Not sure if my landscape lights support dimming, they are just the cheap Hampton bay ones from Home Depot.  But a switch that supported dimming would be good in case these support it, or I swap the lights out later.

I just don't think it's the correct choice for an apartment that's mostly carpet w/ area rugs. And I'm only posting here because I did a decent bit of research beforehand, and wish I had seen this sort of post to inform my decision.

Basically it can get up some of our area rugs but not others--it will either vacuum around that real estate entirely, or it may make it up by chance and then get kind of confused--not sure why, but I'm guessing maybe it has something to do with the cliff sensor and the deepness of the rug? Or something? Who knows.

Worth mentioning that it does easily get up a couple of the rugs in my apartment but not others-- I have a couple older ones that are pretty broken in, and they seem to be thin enough for the S5 to handle.

Anywho here are some pics: one shows it getting stuck between a rug and the wall, one shows it getting stuck trying to get up a rug, and the in-app photo shows you both the large rectangular patch it vacuumed around, as well as the spastic path it took when it managed to climb on another one of the rugs:

e588ki,1575331934,Smart thermometer for a fridge recommendations?,"

Hi,

let's get straight to the issue. I am looking for a smart thermometer that would work in a fridge. In said fridge there are medical vaccines and other medical material that needs to be kept at a certain temperature, GP's office, so not a huge amount, like, 10? 20?, you know. Should the temperature change for various reasons for T amount of time (malfunction of the fridge, power outage), the very expensive material could be compromised/ruined.

Right now the temperature is measured by a simple (dumb) ""radio wireless"" thermometer (or a wired one, doesn't really matter) sitting on top of the fridge.

Today we received an offer for a smart thermometer that will log the temperature (online, as you need to log the temperature every x hours) and notify us should there be a problem - via an sms, even during power outage. The problem is they want 300 dollars (in conversion) and a hefty subscription fee. They claim it to be medical grade, however it's not and they don't provide any warranty anyway.

Now, I'm looking for an alternative. I know there must be some sort of a ""smart"" fridge thermometer with logs and wifi and notifications and ""normal"" subscription or even none at all. However so far I've only found 1 thermometer from La Crosse. None other.

Would anyone have any recommendations?

My thoughts:

The mop feature can be handy on 920, I know essentially its just drags wet rag through out the floor, but some vinegar/cleaning solution mixture should do some good cleaning

I am worried about the low/mid pile carpet issue with S4,

S4 has suction power of 2000 pa, 920 has 1200 pa, big difference in numbers.

Even though the S6 variant had 2000 pa similar to S4, the 950 with 1500 pa outperformed S6 in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZuHgVoJnok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZuHgVoJnok)

Wondering would that be a slimier scenario for 920. May be with 1200 pa it will be equal in performance with S4 picking up derbies.

For the room feature with S4, you can only keep 2 floor maps and over time it removes the virtual walls, with 920 you can save 3 floors which my house has.

920 does come with 2 brush and more accessories/replacement parts.

S4 has larger battery.  150 min run time against 920's 110\~120 min

920 has google assistant and alexa support

The 920 is essentially half ($350) off regular price $700, while S4 is/was $100 off of regular price 400

The 950 comes in second in the vacuum wars for the premium category , only if I could have the 950 for $350\~400!!, but its going for $599, which is $200 off of regular price $800

S4 comes in second in the vacuum wars for the mid range category

Wondering if 920 would be better then S4 for being $50 more...

I can always order both S4 and 920, try them out and return one. But feeling guilty about repackaging and returning a used item :(

 I started reading reviews on Amazon and the two major players APC and Cyberpower get some real stinkers of reviews - way too many people reporting DoA systems, failed within a month systems, and even quite a few ""it caught fire"" systems. Can we really attribute these all to folks who don't know how to install a battery, get dropped systems or have defective wiring or extreme power surges?  

Is there actually much difference between sub $100 consumer stuff these brands sell and their $400+ systems?

And do any of these really work well with a router drawing a few Watts Vs much heavier several hundred watt loads they can technically handle?

Why can't I just get an off the shelf system you connect up to a standard car battery that costs less than the special low capacity batteries they sell as UPS replacement batteries which for whatever reason seem to die after three years despite having almost never being utilized in anger. 

I did see one APC UPS that has a LiIon battery you can detach and use as a USB power bank. It seems like a good idea although the capacity is quite low (20000 mAh). Perhaps someone should make system that can take multiple standard sized power packs that plug in like a RAID storage device. The more you have the more backup capacity.

My main issue is that it seems my thermostat is wired up in a non-standard way, details of what wires connect where can be seen below: (Thermostat Symbol -- Wire Color -&gt; What I think it does)

    R   -- Red     -&gt;  24v Power

    C   -- Black   -&gt;  24v Common
    W2  -- White   -&gt;  Heat
    E   -- White   -&gt;  ?
    
    In addition to this there is a yellow wire, not connected to anything.

Does anyone recognize this color scheme? I reeaaaalllyy don't want to mess up my apartments heating right now (Its winter in KS) and don't want to do anything stupid.

    R + G + W2  -&gt; Heating
    R + G + Y   -&gt; Cooling

So now for some questions:

e5hzel,1575383857,"Replacing ""Modern"" Intercom System","My home (built in 2011) elected to put an intercom system in the house.  I believe it's Legrand/On-Q branded and is pretty basic.  There are some distribution boxes in the closet where all of the little intercom wall-plates are connected back to.  My system is not the selective ones where you can choose where to send your voice.  You talk into one intercom and it's heard throughout the house.  The front doorbell is also connected and sends the chime to all of the wall units.

I have noticed that all of these little boxes are wired using regular Cat 5(a?) cable and I'm wondering if there is some product out there where I could replace all of the units including the distribution box with something actually modern that would also allow for a video doorbell.

TL;DR I have Cat5a cable running throughout my house to little intercom units and would love to have suggestions on replacing the system with something that might still allow for intercom functionality, but more importantly would allow for a video doorbell to replace the current intercom doorbell. 

[This](https://www.legrand.us/onq/intercom/broadcast/icau16-ob.aspx) looks like almost exactly what I have in my home.

e5j8kn,1575389232,Seeking DIY home automation recommendations,"I want to start outfitting my home with some dimmers and I'm having a really difficult time deciding on a platform. I want the ability to control more than just dimmers down the line, but I don't have a defined goal other than that vague desire.

I am an electrical engineer who does quite a bit of systems integration and industrial automation programming (lots of PLC), so the idea of installing and programming my own system isn't a concern, whatsoever. On the contrary, the thought of being prohibited from programming my own system and being forced to rely on a dealer actually annoys me. I have a fairly robust local network (I pulled and terminated the 50+ Cat6 runs during construction, myself), so having a bridge, or even multiple bridges, is not a problem.

I'm leaning toward Lutron (Caseta or RA2 Select) because I've read so many good things about their switches, but I'm hesitant because of what I've read about their software. It sounds somewhat functionally limited to me. I want as much control as possible and would prefer to work with software that is as open as possible, even if it's not particularly user friendly.

Just to give you an idea of how far I'm willing to go to get what I want, I'm not, for example, opposed to the idea of making changes to the firmware of an RA2 Select bridge to give it the functionality I want. But hacking the existing firmware to add that functionality is a skill I don't have.

Anyway, I talked about Lutron quite a bit here, but I am open to other platforms if I can get what I'm looking for.",Papplebeast,/r/homeautomation/comments/e5j8kn/seeking_diy_home_automation_recommendations/,30,homeautomation,68

e5unv9,1575438379,Would anyone be interested in a DIY door/window sensor?,"TLDR; I made a little WiFi door sensor based on the ESP8266 which works super fast, reliable, and has a long battery life.  I want to share with the community and may do a small production run if people are interested in having one. Let me know below.

Recently, I have been building my own home automation devices using the faithful ESP8266. I find that buying vendor devices, while convenient, often do not do what I want them to and require a bridge or such to work.

So I built a door sensor from scratch in hopes of seeing how it would perform. After tinkering for ages (prototype board in pic) I managed to squeeze as much out of the esp8266 as possible and ended up with a product I think is on par or better than what you can purchase. A simple overview of the perks of my design are as follows;

* Communicates via **WiFi** based on the **ESP8266-01** in Arduino, (no Zigbee, Zwave)
* **Open and close** sensing
* Fully **programmable** if you want to change the code
* **Lighting fast**, with actuation door open to message sent times of 200ms min and 500ms typical plus a little overhead (depends on router, distances, etc)
* Will talk any protocol; **MQTT, HTTP, TCP, UDP**
* **No cloud** required. But can access the internet to talk to other services if required.
* Battery powered using **AA LiPOFe4 batteries** (or 14430) used in solar lights. Makes buying and replacing super easy from your hardware store or Walmart. 
* LiPOFe4 is also cheaper and safer than Lithium Polymer
* Sleep current of **0.1uA** or less, my meters don't go that low 
* 3D printed case to make it look pretty - would upload design for it

I have had my prototype run for over 9 months on a single 500mAh battery now with no failure. I'm expecting to get at least a  year out of the battery, but hoping for more based on some simple calcs. Its currently on the front door of my apartment and turns the lights on based on the time of day so I would notice when it doesn't work. See the attached video for an idea on how it works and actuation times. I also have a later production prototype running in my parents home which is also going on 6 months strong. 

Honestly I was not expecting anything close to what I build so I'm super happy with the result. I want to do a small production run for myself and a few others in the near future once I really nail down the design and case. But given its already improved my home automation so much I want to share it with the community to those who may be interested. 

My idea would be to put it on a site such as Tindie or PCBway (with no markup) so that anyone international may purchase a board or two rather than me shipping it all the way from Australia (cause our shipping prices suck). I would probably create an Arduino library if there is interest to allow easy setup and integration into other automation products such as node red, smart things, Alexa, or anything with a web hook really.

If you are interested let me know. If there is enough I will finish the design off and make it final before releasing.

e5w4bv,1575447181,Future proofing whilst waiting to afford a home automation solution,"Hi all,

We're about to get some work done on our house which will result in quite a bit of remodelling and is therefore an ideal time to install some home automation, however the budget won't stretch to the actual devices yet.

I'm toying with the idea of either KNX or LOXONE in future, so my thoughts are to get the electrician to run all the cables back to a central patch panel/location as part of the build, and then I can add stuff in at a later date.

The thing I'm struggling with is which cable to run for the home automation ""trunk"" - the ""Tree"" cable from LOXONE and the ""official"" KNX cable seem to be reasonably similar to the untrained eye, however some people I've spoken to have recommended just running CAT6 everywhere and be done with it. I have concerns over whether CAT6 would handle the voltage/amps appropriately, however I will be running it to each room for network access (Unifi)

Up until now I've been running a combination of LightwaveRF, HomeAssistant, Alexa, and SONOS, and I'd really like to drop both HomeAssistant and the Lightwave kit in favour of something ""a bit more pro"" (we don't tend to use Alexa for voice control other than the Nest themostat!)

Is there a setup that would allow you to ALSO turn the lamp on and off with the physical lamp switch without 'messing up' the integration?

What I have experienced is that if I try to manually turn it on, and then manually turn it off, it then does not work since the smart bulb always expects it to be 'on' for it to work.

You may wonder what Almond is? This is the first open-source, social virtual assistant that can be run on local devices to protect privacy. Among other things, Almond allows you to control Home Assistant using natural language. Once installed, it will be available on Home Assistant web Interface via the microphone icon.

I hope that you find this tutorial useful and definitely stay tuned for the other tutorials that are coming up.

My device is an Apple iPhone X using firmware 12.4.1 which I've used to download the appropriate application for each smart plug.

Has anyone experienced issues connecting smart plug devices with this type of equipment? Based on my inability to configure the smart plugs I returned them. I'm now timid to try another without some guidance.

e6c8c8,1575521672,Neutral wire issues with Wemo switches,"Tonight I tried and failed to install these:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NPZVYR1?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

Our house is new, and has a few dozen Philips hue bulbs throughout.

We have a chandelier in our entryway that requires candelabras, and the Hue ones are not very nice looking, so instead it just has regular bulbs hooked up to a 3 way switch.

On one of the switches, installing the Wemo causes the 5 Philips Hue Filament bulbs in the dining room to flicker, flash, and generally become unresponsive. Powering them on and off at the switch works perfectly fine, but dimming them causes the flickering to return.

On the other switch, installing the Wemo causes that breaker to trip.

Putting the dumb switches back in returns everything back to normal, status quo, no flickering or tripping.

Swapping the Wemo’s into the other locations changes nothing. This leads me to believe the neutral wires are the problem.

My question is, basically, WTF is happening.

Is it possible these switches use so much power on the neutral side, that they would trip one breaker and cause flickering on another?

The smart switches are not being installed to control smart lights. They are being installed to control dumb lights. How could a smart switch on one circuit negatively impact smart lights on another?

Is it possible to join the same mesh?

Can two zigbee hubs really coexist while some devices are controlled by one and some by other?

Currently I have a few different platforms/brands of devices (Nest, Insteon, Kasa) and I'm looking for a UI Dashboard for easy control of my devices via an iPad. The most reliable option (and easiest to understand and use) has been HomeKit, but there are obviously a lot of limitations there.

What do ya'll use to control your stuff, aside from the mfg apps or a voice assistant? I find it hard to convey to guests the proper naming of different lights/devices, so using Alexa or Google isn't always ideal, and having several different apps doesn't help if the person using it doesn't know the manufacturer of the specific device.",rcasad,/r/smarthome/comments/e6jvvc/new_here_looking_for_some_direction/,4,smarthome,3

e6lk8i,1575571619,"Google Nest Compatibility - Thermostat has a wire labeled ""T""","Hello!

I ordered a Google Nest Thermostat over the thanksgiving holidays and the setup's stumping me a little bit. 

While going through the setup process, the Google Nest asked me to check off all the labels that were wired. I went ahead and did so with the exception of the tan/brown wire labeled ""T"" (which was not an option). Stepping through the remaining setup process, Google Nest  never asked me anything about the ""T"" label - it asked me about quite a few other labels but never the ""T"". At the end Google Nest concluded that it was not compatible with my thermostat setup because of an unknown label that it had not been able to present me an option for (""T""). 

Afterwards, my curiosity was piqued and I tried to figure out what the ""T"" cable was. There isn't much information, so it's probably a rare label, but it seems like it might be used with an external temperature sensor (?). 

Anyway, I was hoping one of you guys here with more knowledge than me would be able to help out here. To help you help me, I've attached a diagram of the thermostat cabling below.

e6mdj9,1575574944,[UK] Looking for a smart thermostat that is not cloud-dependent,"I've just bought a house and want to get started with home automation for it. The thermostat is some ancient Honeywell thing from the early 90s so it's a prime candidate for being replaced with something smarter than just on/off at a couple of preset times.

The problem I'm having is finding a suitable smart thermostat that isn't dependent on the cloud for control and automation - all the well-known brands like Nest, Hive, Tado etc. are completely out for this reason. I'm completely against having something controlling a crucial system of my house that is ultimately under someone else's control and the privacy implications that arise from this. There's also the risk of the device turning into a dumb brick if the internet connection goes down, they go out of business, or just decide to shutter their service (see: Revolv, Nest). The ancient Honeywell doesn't have any of these potential problems.

My ideal smart thermostat would therefore have the following features:
* Available in the UK and supports UK central heating systems.
* Supports 2-channel operation for a conventional boiler with heating and hot water.
* Supports smart TRVs (I have about 10 radiators in the house) and integrates temperature control with them.
* Has a local, documented and supported API. Home Assistant integration is nice to have, but I can write my own code if there isn't an available component.
* Cloud connectivity is not a deal-breaker per se, but it should be *optional* and not a key requirement for autonomous functioning. [If I wake up one morning and the house is icing over because the internet went down overnight](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/02/centrica_hive_outage/), it's going straight in the bin.

My problem now is actually finding such a product on the market, since all the major names I've come across depend on the cloud in some way.

It seems to me that these DIY systems are going to take most of the market in home automation.  I have a Crestron system for my entire house and I'm considering not installing it.  Seems like the only thing I would use it for is a really expensive entertainment control for my house.  Even with that having streaming services almost makes matrix switchers pointless.  Almost everything can be done with a DIY system that would take a $100k system made with the other equipment.

I would like to integrate zwave things with Crestron, but don't know if it is worth the time to figure out.  Right now there isn't a really good solution for that integration, so it would have to be very custom.

I mostly design and build smart rooms for schools and businesses, but I do some programming on the side for houses.  Possibly I'm missing something since I mostly do big corporate setups.

e6pcca,1575586991,"Google Nest Home Hub Issue, Vol 2: The Plot Thickens (x-post to r/googlehome)","**The Problem:**

I posted here some time ago about an issue with my Google Nest Hub Max, and after several frustrating months of problem-solving with Google and some admirable attempts to help from Reddit, the problem has somehow gotten worse, weirder and way more interesting.

I started developing a strange issue with my GNHM several months ago when I would wake up in the morning and it would be freaking the f*** out. Which is to say, all of the menus would be flying open, pictures sliding around the backdrop etc. 

Cool, the Nest is haunted. 

Then it got worse. When the menus were open, buttons would get activated. Lights would turn on and off all over the house, the temperature would change, the news would start blaring in the middle of the night. I have video (link below) of the Nest threatening to unlock the door as it talks to itself. There were hardware issues, too. Eventually, the camera just stopped working on the unit. My wife, who was always skeptical of home automation, looked at me like a defense attorney resting her case. 

So finally, after waiting several weeks for some kind of advanced team to get back to me, I decide that the otherwise great Google Support team needs a little encouragement. I call and explain more forcefully that they are the ghost waking my wife and I up every night when the lights flicker under our bedroom door. They agreed to send me a new unit under the pretense that I had received a dud.

But then the new one came, and now it's doing the same thing. 

I don't have a statistics background, but I'm going to go ahead and assume it's unlikely I got two duds in a row. Which leads me to conclude that this is somehow environmental? And that, my friends, is why I humbly ask for your advice in considering what I could possibly be doing to haunt my own house. 

I do have some interesting experiments I've conducted. For a guy who's somehow managing to haunt himself, I think it was clever to point a different Nest camera at my GNHM to gather data in the night. Every morning I check the feed to see what new insanity I can learn from. For instance, who knew this problem only happens when Google sends some kind of signal [update? mind control?] to restart my device every night between 2:30am and 4am, but usually around 3:30am? 

I still haven't cracked the case, though, and I could really use a Watson to my Holmes.  

**Here's what I've ruled out:**

- The problem doesn't happen when I reboot the unit, only when Google sends their early morning signal (although my first GNHM eventually got bad enough that it would bug out on every reboot)
- It wasn't prevented by enabling Do Not Disturb to interfere with whatever signal Google was sending
- It wasn't affected by disabling Google usage data and crash reports
- It isn't affected by being on a WiFi mesh system (Meshforce), as I disabled it one night and it still did it
- It wasn't affected by being on 2.4ghz versus 5ghz
- It wasn't affected by being plugged into an extension cord versus being plugged into a wall socket
- It wasn't affected by removing off brand Chinese products on the wifi network
- It still happened when I removing two large metal candle holders immediately to either side
- It didn't happen when I disabled the ambient light setting
- Not Face Match

**Things still to be ruled out &amp; other clues:** 

- There is a nearby vent blowing warm air that passes behind it along the wall
- There is a fireplace that impedes a direct path to router, though this is why I have a wifi mesh system across three floors of townhouse
- My Home Hub hasn't been doing the thing where it beeps to acknowledge commands at night, instead choosing to yell loudly that it turned off the lights instead (has it not been updated?)
- The other products on my network are almost all Kasa mini smart plugs, with the exception of other Nest devices and a Nest-Yale lock
- Despite it being plugged into the wall, there is an extension cord with other devices in the other open socket
- My Nest Hub settings make several brightness adjustments

e6ppan,1575588553,Roomba i7+ vs Neato D7 vs whatever else,"I know this question has been asked already in one form or another, but still trying to get a reality check here.

Got the cyber monday pricing on the Roomba i7+ at $699 less $100 for signing up for a Amazon credit card.  Have been using it for a few days and happy with it in a 800 sq ft single floor apartment.  

No issues until I read about the Neato D7 and it's ability to handle low light cleaning better.  I'm in a pretty dark apartment and want to be able to clean it automatically when I'm not at home.  I have a 30 day exchange window and the pricing on the D7  is also low: $499.  So now is the time to really dive in to comparing the two as I have the option to return i7 and get Neato (or another brand)...

Trying to figure out if the low light capability will really matter in the long run.  I'm at the point where I've run the Roomba enough times that it's barely picking up dirt between cleanings.   But haven't really battle tested enough in low light situations or used over time.  However my thinking is that even if it misses a few spots, I can't believe it won't still do the job in the long run if I run it automatically every day or other day...  

I also have medium pile carpeting in one room and hear the Neato is better on carpets, but again, I'm thinking the i7 is good enough.

So I guess that's my question: Even if the D7 wins out in low light and carpet cleaning capabilities, if I'm running the roomba i7 every day or every other day is it really going to make a difference in the end?

I'm also a bit nervous about Neato as there are so many complaints on amazon reviews and reddit.  That alone may cement the deal with Roomba.

Roborock s4 - tested 1 month

Roborock s6 - tested 2 months

Deebot Ozmo - 3 days

**Roborock S4:**

Design: Sleek and thin robot its easy to go under most of the furniture and uses single side brush.

Pros: Navigation, hardwood floor pick up (various suction levels), Quieter. Software/App is awesome

features(no go zones, room splitting \*,zone cleaning) and battery 1 charge it cleaned both floor.

Cons: Carpet cleaning keep getting brush blocked (with hair..etc) and inability climb bath mats.

Tile cleaning is just ok.

No multifloor maps (max 3 - 1-cleaning map. 2- cleaning mas with no go zones. 3- is backup)

**Roborock s6:**

Design : Little thick compared to S4 and it has mopping and uses single side brush

Pros: Navigation, hardwood floor pick (various suction levels). Carpet cleaning is better compated to S4.

Software/App is awesome features(no go zones, room splitting \*,zone cleaning)

Good Climbing ability. No multifloor maps (max 3) and battery 1 charge it cleaned both floor.

Cons: Still not that great on carpet. Multifloor maps not available. Little louder compared to s4

**Deebot 920:**

Design : Think Robot (like s4) and it has mopping and it has two brushes.

Pros: Cleaning on Hardwood floor is good and carpet is also good (not even single block errors). little better

pickup due to two side brush (not a significant but better). Multifloor maps (was not able figure out this

yet every time i do it overwrites on each maps). Software features(no go zones, room splitting \*,zone

cleaning). Climbing ability is pretty good better than s6.

Cons: Battery not that great (max 1 floor with 1200 sqft)

Navigation slow some time its thinks thinks..

goes to some places and gets stuck.

\*software glitches unable to identify docking station. most of the time it does not where is the dock    

even you map whole house. Figuring out multicolor maps hard to do no help anywhere and everytime 

map overwrites on each other or merge.

**Verdict**: Roborock s6 &amp; s4 (it has everything software features, hardware and its flawless).

**Runner up**: Deebot cleaning 920 is awesome cleaner and they have to fix docking issues and software glitches. the

whole purpose of robot is cleaning without user intervention. Navigation should be improved.",srinips18,/r/homeautomation/comments/e6rhfb/roborock_s4_vs_roborock_s6_vs_deebot_ozmo_920/,5,homeautomation,5

I am planning to treat myself with some no neutral zwave dimmers (fibaro or qubino) for christmas and I see that especially if I take a dimmer that uses no neutral a bypass load can be necessary to prevent flickering of led bulbs. I also know that these bypass loads are sold separately for some 10 euros per piece, so the question is: what are exactly these bypass loads? Are they some high voltage resistors, or some high voltage capacitors in a plastic box? Are they something else? If so, then the price seems a bit high, since you can buy supplies for probably less than a euro each.

I used to be on Wink (hub in middle of house) and now am on a Hubitat (by front door). But same issues - my Z-wave range is around 15’ (which is why my hub is by the front door for my August zwave lock).

I grew up in a similar house (1930s, plaster lathe etc) and my 900mhz cordless phone never had issues so these walls can’t be that shielding. 

Here’s an example - 20’ line of site from hub to outlet works. If I put the outlet behind my couch (fabric pottery barn sectional - no metal inside) where it’s still 20’ away it won’t work. If I lift it up from behind the couch so it’s not obstructed it will work.

If I put a Z-wave device around a doorway it won’t work. I tried using multiple zwave devices to make a mesh but if I can’t find an outlet every 10 feet I can’t get far.

I ended up switching to Lutron and Zigbee with no issues.

So I've been searching for a while for a way to make my kitchen light smart. Because the thing is, it's just a neon tube on the ceiling so there's no way I'd find a smart neon tube. So I was thinking of replacing the light switch by a smart switch.

But there are a few problems:

* I need it to work with both Alexa and HomeKit. So HomeKit only stuff won't work, but I might be able to add Alexa only devices to my Homebridge server.
* I already have a Hue bridge and a Harmony Hub. So if it could work with either, that would be great.
* I have looked into the Aqara switch (which are Zigbee so might work with the Hue bridge?) but it seems like even the mural switches are made to control already smart bulbs? Not to make a dumb light smart?
* EDIT: It needs to be available in Europe

And other question, does the Aqara hub makes Zigbee devices work with homekit?

i've got 2 Amcrest UltraHD 2K WiFi Camera 3MP, i'm quite happy with them, but for one thing: **they don't tilt down!**

They only tilt up, and when setup at the top of a dresser for example, they can't tilt down to show the room. The official solution from Amcrest support is either to fix them on the ceiling (which i don't want to as I'm renting the place, plus i would need to have the power wiring coming from somewhere), or to use the provided stand, which is what i'm doing now, but that's kinda ugly.

I'm going to move into a new place, and will have one additional room to cover, so **i'd like to get an equivalent camera, but which can actually tilt down.**

""equivalent"" is quite vague, what i actually like in the Amcrest i have is:

* it's open, and can be integrated with any ip camera software. I need to be able to use it with Synology Surveillance Station as well as Home Assistant.
* it has PTZ
* it has night vision
* it has a ""normal"" viewing angle (90°), which is good for my use (nursery cam)

Most of the lighting that I'm installing is recessed cans. I'd like to have some sort of zoned control of the cans, and it seems like there are a few options:

1. I can install traditional smart switches.pros: very traditional setupcons: lots of wiring and switches to install. potentially need 3 gang boxes in some places. no color.
2. I can install scene controllers where the switches would be

and then....

&amp;#x200B;

2a) Install smart controllers in junction boxes (like aeotec nanoswitch) and use conventional lights

&amp;#x200B;

or

2b) use smart recessed lights and just have a hidden power off switch for servicing the lights (or just use an independent breaker, not sure if having a physical switch is required by code...)

pros: just need a 1-gang box in each room (or each side of room)

cons: might not work if controller goes down. Could be really confusing for guests. both are pretty untraditional and may have code issues

It seems that there are zigbee smart controllers that might not rely on having a hub working.

I'd put one gang boxes where I want guests to be able to control the lights and just drop one of those there.

After typing this out, I'm leaning towards using one of these with some recessed zigbee lights, like Sylvania lightify lights. I hope the inspector has no code issues with none of the lights having an actual physical switch.

I have quite a bit of can lighting in the house and so I started with Merkury BR30s. At first I thought they were great temporary lights for what I needed. I could start buying those and then replace them with Hues as I'm able. 

The problem is that sometimes they just lose their programming --  when the power flickers in a storm or strong wind for example they are into reset mode. Then they just flash on and off until I reconnect my phone to them and reset them. A bit of a problem when I'm at work. I wish that instead of flicking when they lose their settings, they just work as regular light bulbs. My other issue is when they come on, they go 100% to white, then down to the color I want which is around 90% with a bit more yellow (trying to match the standard br30s I still have). This part is a bit picky -- I could live where it turns on all the way before changing to the settings I want but the strobe light effect has to go.

Any recommendations?

I want to install a smart dimmer switch which includes an occupancy motion sensor. In particular, must-haves are:

* Turns on when motion is detected, to a percentage I can set
* Can be dimmed

Ideally the switch would also be smart, but this isn't a requirement:

* Allows me to control (through SmartThings) the dimmed brightness. For example, it would be nice to have the motion sensor turn the bulbs to 20-30% of the normal brightness during night hours.
* Report occupancy/motion and state to SmartThings, so that it can be combined with general occupancy sensing of the home, etc.

I had been looking at this [Lutron Maestro dimmer](https://www.amazon.com/Lutron-Maestro-Single-Pole-Multi-Location-MSCL-OP153M-WH/dp/B00CAO4NUM) which accomplishes both of my must-have goals but doesn't have any smart functionality.

e7pfuq,1575780464,Is there a way to turn on a TV with a wireless (Wifi?) switch?,"I have a theater room in my basement and a lobby outside that room.  I would like to install a TV in the lobby that displays movie posters.  I would like to have a switch at the top of the stairs that I can flip to turn on the TV so that when I/we get downstairs the TV is already on displaying a poster.  Likewise, when we finish up and go back upstairs flipping it again would turn the TV off.  It would be a lot of work to run wiring through the walls up the stairs hence why I am looking for a wireless solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine a possible solution could be to turn on the TV with an app on the phone but I'm not in favor of that as I would prefer something more instinctual or automatic.  I say instinctual because I already have to flip a switch at the top of the steps to turn on the lights downstairs.  So another switch next to it would be easily activated without much thought.  Conversely, my wife would never remember to use an app before her and some friends went downstairs.

I also figured a motion sensor would be an option but I want the TV on the entire time I'm downstairs and that would be a highly variable amount and I don;t want it turning off while we are downstairs watching movies.

I bought two Leviton DW15P-1BW WiFi outlets on sale at Home Depot. $20 bucks each. I wanted one to replace a simple timer outlet I use for a ""night light"" lamp in one of our rooms. My plan was to use on/off times relative to sunset and sunrise instead of a fixed schedule that I needed to adjust every couple months. I got everything set up in the My Leviton app and also setup notifications through the IFTTT app to tell me when it was turning on and off. It mostly worked but would shut off the light way earlier than the 1 hour after sunrise I had programmed. Since sunset was working I figured the location info must have been correct to get the local sunset/sunrise times. Because I was sending notifications to my phone I had an Aha moment and noticed the light was shutting off exactly 12 hours after turning on. That was too much of a coincidence. I searched and discovered in the Device Settings -&gt; Settings I had the Auto Shutoff Time set to the max of 12 hours. This apparently overrides my 1 hour after sunrise ""off"" event scheduled *more* than 12 hours after my scheduled 1 hour before sunset ""on"" event.

&amp;#x200B;

I am able to get the relays to show up through the Alexa app and through the eWeLink apps, and I setup KioWare to restrict access to just one app. So all of that works. You can use the app to turn on and off the relays, you can't exit the app. That is all good.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem, though, is that within those apps, there are a lot of other things to click on still which can take the screen away from the control panel that I want it to stay on. (The Alexa app, for example, can be navigated to skills and games where visitors will be in an altogether different spot than the device control section the tablet needs to remain on.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen ActionTiles, and it looks like it would solve my problem possibly, but it has to be run through SmartThings, and I'm not seeing a way to add the relays I need into SmartThings.

e7ztol,1575840682,Trouble installing a Lutron Caseta Dimmer in a 3-way switch,"So I'm trying to install my first smart switch, and I went with a Lutron Caseta dimmer (model PD-6WCL).  I'm not an electrician by any stretch, and I have had absolutely no luck installing it properly.

There were two existing switches controlling the lights, which were Lutron Maestro dimmers, and it looks to be set up as a 3-way switch.  I installed the Caseta dimmer in one of the boxes and capped the wires in the other switch location as per the the [Lutron installation instructions]( https://www.casetawireless.com/documents/0301710a_caseta%20advanced%20inst.pdf)

When I turn the breaker on, the light turns on, but the switch doesn't function and the LED indicators don't light up.

A quick googling suggests a few troubleshooting steps, but I've tried all combinations of the following and always end up the same result:

1. Moving the switch to the other box, and capping the original.

2. Switching which black wire on the Lutron is attached to the tagged wire.  The instructions say the blacks coming out of the Lutron are interchangable, but some people have said this makes a difference.

3. For the capped box, capping the two hot wires and the tagged wire separately.

Is there something I'm missing here?  I've taken a quick photo of the wiring based on the vanilla Lutron instructions: https://imgur.com/a/nOhZPiU

My house was built in the 1950s, I'm assuming the two bare copper wires are ground (I hope that's a safe assumption), but surprisingly the ground wasn't connected in one of the two Maestro switches that I removed, which I thought was odd.

Anyway, I'm hoping someone with a lot more experience can help me understand what I'm doing wrong :)

e830yk,1575855855,Need help diagnosing a problem...,"The other day while I was at work, I noticed that all of my TP-Link Kasa devices were offline. About the same time, my August locks kept disconnecting/reconnecting every few mins. So when I got home I tried to figure out what happened.

Here's what I can figure out... For whatever reason all of my Kasa devices will disconnect and will not reconnect... can't even add them back to the wifi, unless I reboot my router. After I reboot then the Kasa devices will show up as connected in the app and I can control them with Google... for about 5 mins. Then they all go gray again and will stay that way until I, once again, reboot the router.

So now I've about reached what I can think of and am getting ready to move over to hardware issues. Here's what I have, and what I've tried.

* Router: pfSense in a VM on a Dell R710
* Switch: Cisco gigabit
* AP: Unifi AC Lite
* Fiber ONT box, using static IP

Before Friday, everything worked fine. I could use Google to turn Kasa lights on/off as well as the smart plugs. Then around 10am they all dropped off. I have...

* Rebooted the router (Kasa comes back online for a few mins before disconnecting again)
* Reprovisioned/Rebooted the AP (no difference)
* I turned off any sort of filtering on the pfSesne VM (no difference)
* I created a brand new pfSense VM, left everything at defaults (same as if I rebooted the router)
* Completely shut down the entire network (no difference)

What I have not done yet...

* Completely reset the AP. I do have a wife who needs the internet for work so I have to pick and choose what I do and plan accordingly.
* Swapped out hardware. I'm not sure how to diagnose if the AP is going out other than ordering a new part and swapping it out.
* Other things? I don't know... I've run out of things I can think of.

Other info:

* Hardwired devices seem to be fine. I have several phillips Hue lights connected to a Hue Hub and they all work just fine.
* The Logitech Harmony hub works, but there is a min or two delay after you press a button to the action to happen.
* Eufy Cams seem to be working fine... but, again, they connect to their own hub.
* I have two Nest doorbells. They seem to be working fine.
* I have several Google/Nest homes, minis, and hubs. They all seem to be fine.
* I have a Hubitat hub, and that seems to be working fine.

Any ideas on what I could try next? Should I go ahead and order a new AP and just see if that's the issue?",hbar98,/r/homeautomation/comments/e830yk/need_help_diagnosing_a_problem/,1,homeautomation,10

e88oa7,1575890171,Very basic 101 question - hubs,"Hi All -

I just joined this sub to ask this extremely basic question. I’m fairly new to smart home automation but I have my entire place fully automated. My question:

What are the point of “hubs” (SmartThings for example) vs say “Alexa” or “Google Home”? What’s the upside? My Alexa device literally controls everything through voice or opening the app. Why do people need a separate hub since so many manufacturers can be run through either Google Home or Alexa? I guess I’m just confused on what the upside is of having a “hub” as opposed to a device with voice control that effectively acts as a hub. Maybe it’s one in the same and hubs are for people who don’t necessarily want voice control?",GarfieldSighs3,/r/smarthome/comments/e88oa7/very_basic_101_question_hubs/,7,smarthome,14

e8a0x7,1575898507,How to reuse cut off led strip lights with Google Home?,"First off, if this is in the wrong place please let me know and I'll post elsewhere.

I'm building my first pc in the next few weeks. I'll be using a Govee Alexa/Google Home led strip to add the lights to the back of my desk but will be cutting the strip around half way through as they're sold in 5m packages but I don't need that much.

The off cuts can be reused if they're cut correctly and I have another part of the man cave that could benefit from some lights but I can't for the life of me work out which controller or power supply to use. Govee don't sell separate accessories like this and I can't work out what to get. 

Being able to integrate with the Google home ecosystem is essential, I'm assuming it is the controller that is responsible for this? Also I don't want to under/over power them from the power supply either. Finally, what is needed to get the off cut to be attached to the new controller so that they function correctly?

These are the lights I'm using for reference

e8an8x,1575901784,"Integration - Kwikset, Drone, MyQ","Morning all. Was going to make separate posts but to save space a few questions in one:

First my setup 
-	just recently installed and set up a Samsung SmartThings Hub (newest gen)
-	have both versions of the app
-	installed a Kwikset 888 lock on front door
-	have a prior-existing Chamberlain MyQ garage door hub that operates my old opener. It’s compatible with IFTTT and 
-	have the Drone remote start in my truck that I operate with the app on my phone but is compatible with Alexa. 
-	have Amazon Echo devices around house and am currently setting up a Fire 8 HD tablet as controller 
-	also have a Ring doorbell in front by door with Kwikset and Floodlight in back of house. So I have a ring account. 

I’m trying to figure out the best way to integrate everything. Things I’d like to be able to accomplish if possible:

-	unlock the door based on proximity. Either via phone location or the SmartThings arrival sensor. Similar to how the August Smart Lock pro will (I was going to get that lock but it was double the price and I want a keypad for a couple family members who don’t have smartphones)
-	be able to remote start car from my control board (plan is to use ActionTiles but I’ve been told HomeAssistant is good but requires more work to set up) as well as via Alexa (there’s a Alexa Skill so that should be easy)
-	be able to determine status (open v closed) and open / close garage door (my understanding is there’s a 3rd party smartapp but custom smart apps aren’t supported on the new SmartThings app and that it still requires a MultiPurpose sensor to determine orientation because the MyQ won’t report it from their sensor)

I tried setting up a SmartApp via the web page but after “publishing” it, the app still never shows in either new or old app. 

My understanding is that by setting up a virtual button in SmartThings and using it to trigger an Alexa routine I can generally activate things that are Alexa compatible, is that correct? I have yet to try it. I also don’t think it will work with the Kwikset lock. 

Any suggestions on accomplishing my goals, or he’ll anything crazy anyone can think of with this setup to do just for the fuck of it?

Thanks all for the time to read and think about this and thanks in advance for any help. I don’t always remember to get back and type “thanks” because I’m an old man chasing a 2.5yr old around all day 😂",wtporter,/r/homeautomation/comments/e8an8x/integration_kwikset_drone_myq/,0,homeautomation,0

Background: I live in an apartment door is a Hollow core steel door. I was told by the building I can install my own top lock and drill as well. Purchased a Yale + Nest Smart lock. Already have a mortise lock as well at the bottom and looking to replace the vertical deadbolt with that. Building is pretty safe.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to two locksmiths and the first one told me installing a deadbolt is impossible on a hollow steel door. The second told me was possible and would need to drill above the current vertical deadbolt for $450 sounds reasonable for the amount of work. However he said I cant use the Yale + Nest lock because that is a square and not rounded and I should buy the kwikset one. I'm not really sure what that means I assume is the deadbolt shape?

I'm trying to understand this better. If anyone here can comment regarding this situation.

Thanks

My thought is to put in smart bulbs in the three rooms, then cover the existing switches with either a plate or a smart bulb remote. I would then control the fans with the pull chain, and the lights with the remote/google.

Old  school classic  dimmer switches (non-z-wave) usually have a physical  slider of some  kind to control dimming level, and then an on-off toggle  as well.

Can  anybody here point  me to a Z-wave plus wall dimmer that actually has a  slider to adjust  dimming?  ( typical z-wave dimmers have a paddle that  is held down for a  second or so  and then letting go at the correct  level of dimming...  this seems beyond kids and guests).

I'm starting a new business soon doing smart home product installations. The idea is that we get you the products, install them in your home and get you set up to control them yourself. I plan to do the following and I wanted to get your opinion on the various elements. Pitfalls you've encountered, bad practices etc.  

**The setup**  
\- Raspberry Pi 3 (1GB Ram, 8GB microSD) as the local smarthub in the client's home.  
\- Planning to use Raspbian + Docker with HomeAssistant and NodeRed (Haven't decided if NodeRed should be its own container or a HomeAssistant add-on - though I'm leaning on the latter. What do you think?).

**The products**  
\- Lights, Thermostats, Alarms, motion detectors and other security products, Smoke/Gas detector, speaker systems, Google Home Minis for voice control, Garage door opener etc.

**Backend (our offices)**  
\- Remote access to the Pi/Containers/HomeAssistant with PiVPN (contingent on client compliance of course - for OTA updates and NodeRed automation customization).

**Frontend (customer)**  
\- Tuya App or HomeAssistant web-app (saved to home screen) so that you only need 1 app.

Am I overlooking something important in any of these steps? Thanks!",jinglewiz,/r/homeautomation/comments/e8oifr/advice_on_home_automation_business_setup/,2,homeautomation,3

I'm trying to find one that doesn't replace the main light switch, bc for some reason my main power outlet in my living room is connected to the light switch, and I don't want to need the overhead light on to watch the TV. 

I'm also not a fan of having an always on mic in my house, which has limited me further.
My lightbulbs work in Google home, and can use IFTT, I'm kinda surprised by how difficult it is to find something like a physical button that can send Ifttt commands..

So far the closest thing I've found is flic, which actually looks great but looking at the reviews on Amazon and they are pretty poor.. I'm not looking to get a hub, because frankly they're just stupidly expensive since I have all of 3 lights installed for the total of my smart devices, and don't plan to add more. 
I also found Bttn which looked great but is apparently only for businesses?

I also thought about using a raspberry pi, which seems like it should be easy enough, but trying to Google around to figure out how exactly I'd do that led me to far more advanced stuff like turning non-smart lights smart, setting up motioncapture devices and automating my garage door (first few Google searches), which seems like.. a lot.

So, I come to Reddit, to see if those who know more than me can assist.

For example, I don't want my night vision destroyed when I get up to go pee in the night, and can get back to sleep straight away afterwards. I figure a motion sensor in my hallway outside the bedroom door, a light sensor to gauge the ambient light levels, and a program to tell the hallway and bathroom lights to turn on at 20% brightness in red light only when it detects motion below a certain ambient light level, ie night time. Plus motion detection sensitivity (or maybe mask off areas) so my cats don't set it off.

Is a Raspberry Pi best for this? Is IFTTT best for the programming? Do I need a permanent-on internet connection for the IFTTT rules to work or can I download a local copy? Which inexpensive motion sensor and light sensor units are recommended? 

I don't mind a bit of tinkering with software (but I'm no programmer) but would like to keep hardware costs low as I live in a rental.

&gt;CHANGING BULBS

&gt;Even with the dimmer switch turned off, a small amount of current still flows to the load. The Air Gap Switch on the dimmer switch physically disconnects power from the load. Perform the following steps whenever you change bulb(s) connected to the dimmer switch.

&gt;1.	Turn the dimmer switch off, then slide the Air Gap Switch to the left.

&gt;2.	Change the bulb(s).

&gt;3.	Slide the Air Gap Switch to the right.

I have Wemo and TPLink/Kasa dimmers, and don’t recall similar warnings or options in their instructions. I’m not enthused about this air gap because I might not remember (it’s just changing a bulb!), my wife and kids certainly won’t remember, and my kids are likely to idly flip the air gap switch and then phone me at work complaining that the light doesn’t work any more. 

My questions, for someone with some electrical smarts:

* is this a real concern? Is it a huge excess of caution on Monoprice’s part?
* if it’s a real concern, why only Monoprice? Am I taking my life in my hands when I change a bulb on my Wemo dimmer? Or did I miss a memo?",iayork,/r/homeautomation/comments/e96s04/monoprice_stitch_dimmer_air_gap_switch/,3,homeautomation,8

e97enc,1576072612,What light switches do you use for smart lights?,"So I replaced every single light in my home with Lifx Mini bulbs and been loving it. I also have Wyze sensors (door and motion) on every room and door of the house and have been using IFTTT to automatically turn on and off the lights. It takes about 5 seconds from when I see the light on the sensors to when the lights receive the command and I'm fine with that but every visitor I have simply, understandably, goes for the light switch which is really annoying because it breaks the automation and when I'm away or wanna use the app for effects or anything I have to physically flip the switch. I bought a random plug I found that I liked the look of, feature set and price (ended up with the WeMo dimmer one but when I installed it I realized that it's meant for dumb lights and while it offers me the option to turn the lights on or off from away it's honestly a little overkill as the switches are more than the lights and only solves one of my problems while not adding any extra functionality. 

TLDR: 

Is there any product or set out there (doesn't have to replace the light switch or even be on a wall) that allows me to do any combination of some of these:

* Turn smart light on and off  through the internet and not through power
* Dim smart lights with the physical device through the internet and not through power
* Not be able to take the power away from the lights
* Be able to be used by anyone and not just me (I know some Bluetooth devices don't work if not in range of a phone that programmed them of a home base. 
* Not be a rocker or a 2 position switch so that it's not confusing when the app is on but the switch is off or vice-versa 
* Possibly have a hold or double-tap function so that I can add scenes or use it with IFTTT to turn on electronics or start timers or something along those lines

Sorry if this has been asked a lot it's just that my approach is usually to go to best buy and buy whatever looks like it has the features I want but I had to look a lot online for some solutions for this and most people I saw talking about it were using the brilliant things which are like $300 each or covering their switches or hardwiring on the lights on and using other buttons or switches of things to get it done. I feel like the setup I got is good enough for me so I'm not willing to go too crazy on buying expensive things but if I can get some extra functionality and help with my guest problems that'd be amazing. It's always awkward when people come in the house and love all the automation and futurism of it all and then flips a switch to turn on light 4 times and nothing happens because they didn't wait for them to turn on.

You basically just need to install the DTH once, and forget about it.  The code will recover and resend any failed thermostat or switch command in the next hour window after an  ST or ecobee outage.\*\*  No other ecobee implementation (and especially the ST stock device) can match this level of resilience and reliability.

&amp;#x200B;

If you’re are a contributor to one of my support packages (and I have access to your ST account), the upgrade has already been done for you. You don’t need to do anything, everything has been taken care of.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

On top of it, there are many complimentary smartapps designed for My ecobee DTH and are located at my github. All ecobee smartapps are explained at the ST community wiki (all ecobee\* smartapps):

e9a3x0,1576085367,Any way to remotely control this AC unit?,"Hi guys. I'm extremely new to this home automation thing. Honestly, the only thing I really want to do is be able to either turn my AC unit on/off remotely or put it on a timer so that it turns on/off by itself. The AC unit is an old window unit and it does not work with IR remotes. Unfortunately I rent this apartment so I can't just go and upgrade it to something from this century. It uses a non-standard high voltage plug. [As seen here](https://i.imgur.com/DG73t2b.jpg) and [the socket it plugs into](https://i.imgur.com/BEziAdx.jpg).

My first train of thought was to get one of those smart plugs, but I was unable to find one that matches the plug and socket shown above. Next I looked into a Sensibo Sky, but it only works on AC units that works with IR remotes - mine does not. From the picture with the socket above, that socket is controlled by the wall switch right next to it. So now my train of thought is to replace that switch with a smart switch. Which leads to the next problem - no neutral wire. [Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/RucTgp2.jpg) and [Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/sdOA9vW.jpg)

If I owned this unit, I would definitely just replace it and have an electrician re-wire the place for neutral wires, but I rent the apartment so that is not an option. In preparation to swap out the switch, I set up HomeAssistant on my Synology NAS via Docker and installed an HUSBZB-1 so it is able to communicate with both Zigbee and Z-Wave. Does anyone have any recommendations on anything else I can possibly do to control this AC remotely? Does a smart switch that requires no neutral wire work with this high voltage appliance even exist? Or am I forever doomed to die in the New Orleans summer heat because I can't turn my AC on an hour before I head home from work?",SiPhuYoda,/r/homeautomation/comments/e9a3x0/any_way_to_remotely_control_this_ac_unit/,1,homeautomation,11

Strangely, the wiring was different in all three junction boxes.  The wiring for Bedroom A and Living Room made sense to me, but the wiring for Bedroom B has me questioning my own understanding.

A bit of background: I am not a trained electrician, but I have considerable experience with both DC circuits and wiring my own 120VAC (lights, fans, switches) and 24VAC thermostats.  I have never before worked with 240V baseboards, which is why I am now having some troubles understanding the wiring of one of the thermostats.

Can anybody help me understand what might be going on in the Bedroom B junction box?  Ultimately, I plan to use a multimeter (don't have mine with me today) to check  the voltage differentials between these wires, and continuity between the wires in the junction box and the ones into the baseboard (to identify which wires go to the baseboard, since none are blue when they get there).  But until I can test that properly, I'm hoping somebody can help me grok what might be going on here.

This is in BC, Canada, but I don't think that matters, because I'm not certain the wire colours match code/standards.

I am thinking of diving deeper into home automation but not sure whether to focus on z-wave or zigbee devices. Obviously Hue uses zigbee but if my goal is to have a really good mesh i should try to stick mostly to one or the other. What about going all wifi? The benefits of that are that they can all be localized to their own VLAN on my home network, but setting the devices up may be a pain since support isn't there.

What is the current state of home auotmation? Where is the future looking like its heading towards? Is Z-Wave going to dominate Zigbee? Will wifi overtake both and find an easier way to handle setting up devices?

I put a strong priority on something that won't require external internet, in fact I probably wont buy a device if it requires internet to function (firmware updates are okay).

I also have a strong strong preference for devices that will be future proof from companies going under. I don't like the fact that z-wave is licensed by a proprietary company as it means that if the company goes under then no more z-wave devices. On the other hand, i like that z-wave isn't in the 2.4GHz band so it should have less interferences. But a ton of stuff in the Z-wave spec doesn't make sense: max 3 hops, only 233 devices per network, etc...

--

This wasn't obvious to me when I started with this system, but if you pair a pico remote to a switch, then you decide to get the caseta bridge and add the switch to it, the pico no longer controls the switch.

You have to then add the pico to the bridge as well, and re-configure it (now in the app) to control the switch.

Which means that when your bridge dies, all your picos stop working boooooo.

e9j9ie,1576128344,POE/Wifi Camera suggestions with out the crap?,"Friends, I come to you after much bashing my head against the wall and spending more money than I care to admit. But I have issues. 

I have a house. I'd like it to have cameras that do just camera sh!t. Nothing fancy, just have good resolution and IR leds for night time. The kicker is that I don't want said cameras need ANY kind of cloud service to function and I need them to broadcast an RTSP stream to the rest of the network. 

I have [motioneye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki) up and running, I might later swap it out for [Zoneminder](https://zoneminder.com/) for reasons. Motioneye can pull in N number of RTSP streams and present them in one place. It's flexible and provides a wide array of options for when I get into my animal detection experiments with video machine learning. 

Most of the cameras I've found have this stupid interface that requires a Windows! utility just to administer. The most recent one I bought hard coded the default address to 192.168.2.1.18. Which probably might be ok if my subnet was .1, but it isn't due to reasons (F*ck you AT&amp;T and your stupid router/modem rust bucket). Sure, I could rewire my ENTIRE F*CKING NETWORK to allow this one camera on.... but...

Sigh. So does anyone know and or have direct experience with a decent camera that just does camera sh!t? Preferably POE, but I could be open to wifi. At this point I'm ready to just buy a handful of pi zeros with cameras, run motioneye on them and print a housing and call it a day. Come to think of it that might save me a lot of headache. 

Thanks for reading. I feel better.

My House is 60 squared meters (592 squared feet if i converted correctly) with 3 bedrooms.  The Main uses would be:

helping with cleaning  after living with 3 cats. The debris, LOOTS of Pet Hair and dust of the litter box all around the house.

I Live in Chile, so the local offer is crap or waaay obsolete. Expanding to Buying on Amazon or likewise, for the budget i was aiming, the short list has reduced to:

1. Shark Ion r850: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dobpcEj-wuw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dobpcEj-wuw)
2. Roborock 4 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrqCoZhEksA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrqCoZhEksA)

The Ion can be shipped to Chile, but on February im going to Canada so buying a R4 there is an option. Now, the question: ARE THE LASER SENSORS/APP worth the price difference?

Since is probably gonna be a long term purchase, i could bite the bullet and spend the extra cash, and Room Mapping seems sexy as hell, but only if is really an improvement and not only a PR Flair.

I read a lot of good comments on the Shark Ion, but -speaking from ignorance- the fact that it moves randomly and does not remember when it was when it runs of out battery seems kinda...dumb?. On the other hand, it does the job and at half price.

&amp;#x200B;

Any Help (or alternative) would be apreciated. I also read good things on the Roborock 5, but with a lot of warnings that it does not use the App as well as the Roborock 4, if you have experience on that, you would be a lifesaver.

Naturally these things (farm, workshop, and home) will be some what distant from each other and I want to ensure that there will be good connectivity for my smart devices. 

For LAN/WiFi the solution is simple as I can just run an ethernet line out to wherever and connect a router/switch to hook into my home network.

I am an engineer by trade (EE and CS) so I was planing to use Home Assistant as I like the granular control (and can write Python to extend it if needed). So really I am wondering what protocols are best for my future.

The problem is that no one protocol really has all it's bases covered:
Zigbee problems:

 * congests the 2.4GHz band  
 * has fewer devices than z-wave for most stuff that isn't lighting  
 * up until recently (with zigbee 3.0, i guess) the vendors implementations of the zigbee spec could vary to the point of the devices not being supported  

Z-Wave Problems:

 * Licensed by central authority (problematic from an ideological perspective, as i enjoy open source  
 * Only up to 4 hops per packet (i understand this is to reduce clutter from infinite packet cycling, but i think a better implementation would be a configurable number of hops depending on device or configurable timeout from packet origin timestamp - though that would require all devices to have clocks)  
 * Limited to 233 devices (why wouldnt they just include another byte in the payload to bring this to 16-bit id which is what zigbee has to allow for 65,000 devices)  

Wifi Problems:  

 * Lots of power consumption  
 * Causes congestion on network (may be somewhat solved by a separate VLAN)  
 * less secure

For the record, my router is the [TP-Link Archer C4000](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-c4000/), and I found [this article](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1585/) on VLAN configuration for IPTV, but I can't tell if there's any way for me to make use of it. I also have the router that came with my ISP, if there was a way to chain them together to make this work.

Is there any way to do this without spending hundreds of dollars on a managed switch? Naively, I see 4 ethernet ports on the back of my router, and I'm wondering if there's any way to just separate them, or make each one correspond to a different network.",taltalim,/r/smarthome/comments/e9wr1t/how_do_i_set_up_vlansecurity_for_an_ethernet/,4,smarthome,7

There’s two of us at my house, we BOTH want to use Siri (iPhones) to control the Wemo control like “Christmas lights off”.


I successfully linked the Wemo device from her Wemo app on her phone, to her “home” app (the iPhone smart home hub). Success, Siri now voice controls the outlet for her. But now I can’t seem to connect mine....


I called them and asked if the plugs can connect to two different “home” iPhone apps and she said only one at a time because of Apple IDs. Wtf. Why wouldn’t they enable the devices to be controlled by two iPhones for husband and wife to both be able to use Siri?


Anyway, is there a way around this? I’m trying to learn IFTTT to see if I can find a creative way around this, but still stumped. I was hoping I could create a simple on off rule in IFTTT called “Christmas lights” and hook that up to home/Siri for IFTTT on my phone so I could say “Christmas lights on” as a workaround but I’m not able to figure it out.

ea6lwe,1576256476,New and looking for some advice,"Sorry if this is a common (or stupid) question, but I'm excited and a bit overwhelmed with what I'm diving into.

I've never been much of a home automation/smarthome guy, but we are moving to a freshly renovated house and got a Roomba i7+ because the flooring we picked shows every spec of dust and although I'm not a neat freak I did find it annoying. The fact that I can control the Roomba from anywhere and watching it clean the house was the bug that bit me, and now I want, no, need more.

That said, trying to dive in is pretty intimidating for someone who isn't particularly technical with computer stuff. The most I have is wiring experience (automotive tech) and a small amount of experience playing around with Arduinos (learning more all the time though). If I have to learn new stuff that's fine, but I'm also a fan of things that ""just work"".

My original thought was just get a Google Home and start adding products, but some cursory digging seems to show that smart home device compatibility is a bit of a mess, with words like Zigbee and Z-wave being thrown around alongside wi-fi. Alexa, Google, Home Assistant, and more. I had a brief moment of thinking ""I'll just build and control my own shit with Arduinos"" but pretty quickly changed my mind. It would be a great way to learn, but at the same time it would be time consuming, and probably ugly. For what it's worth, we are rural so although we have internet it's not the greatest. Cloud based isn't ideal, and I don't like the idea of losing smart control of devices if the internet is down. Our house is roughly 50 ft x 30 ft and two levels (40% of the lower level is garage and utility/storage room)

I realize there may not be a simple, easy answer to this stuff. Everyone will probably have some different advice, which is good. Here is my list of things I want:

\- Light switches - This is my big one. I hate going around and checking lights, or forgetting to turn them off, or turning them on/off while away from home. I'd probably be looking at nearly 20 if I did the whole house, including at least 3 3-way switches. I could start small though and do the ones that I'd prefer at first with like...5, including one or maybe 2 3-ways (smart on one end, dumb on the other?) I like the Caseta switches but they are a bit pricey especially in the amounts I'm thinking about. Also of note, all lighting in the house is LED.

\- Blinds/window coverings - we haven't decided on these yet, but we need to do most of the windows in the house anyway so it's going to be a chunk of change regardless. Could do ""smart blinds"" or could just get blinds that lend themselves to easier automation with attachments.

\- Door lock - I have a high security deadbolt/key that I do not wish to replace, but if there were something that fit over the inside lock thing so that I could remotely lock/unlock the door, that would be cool. My wife and I will mostly go in through the garage, but visitors will still use the front and it would be nice to be able to unlock the door and let them in if we aren't home or are in the middle of something and don't want to stop to get the door (feeding the baby, cooking dinner, etc).

Really, that about covers my needs for now. Google/Alexa voice control would be good, and single app integration would also be good. Eventually I might like to add a thermostat and home monitoring cameras, but those are less important.

- remote access to open/close the door is nice. 
- guest access... I’ll definitely use this for people watching the dogs or getting the mail while we’re away. 
- the hub + one sensor (one garage door) bundle was on sale for $27. 
- a second sensor for a second door is cheap ($25). 
- The app tells you if the door is open or closed. 
- There’s a notification that lets you set it up to warn of the door is left open too long, that’s able to be scheduled by time/day of week. 

The bad
- when I hit the button it made a sound like a fire alarm for 10-15 seconds (more on this) to warn people in the garage that the door was going to move. The noise was horrible, and the delay is a little annoying. 
- the instructions made it seem like the hub needed to be mounted on the ceiling near the garage door opener. It does not. I have it over near my workbench for now. I’ll probably mount it above the workbench. 
- there’s a strong in the hub that flashes when the door is moving. It’s annoying but easily covered so doesn’t matter much.

Sorry if this question was already answered somewhere, but I had trouble finding my exact layout

I'm wanting to swap out a wall switch that is in a not-so-convenient spot with a GE Z-Wave Switch. This way I can hook it up to SmartThings and have a button for it and more.

However, after looking at the switch itself. I noticed that it only has three-wires within the box: a ground, a black wire, and a white wire. And the Z-Wave switches have five terminals with one of them requiring a neutral wire.

[Pictures of the Switch itself](https://imgur.com/a/kH2D2e0)

Am I missing the neutral wire in this case and would this prevent me from setting up a smart switch? If not, would it be possible to use this switch with a single black wire that would go into either the line/load?

I'm having a hard time understanding how multiple thermostats work on a house. I can only assume they are room specific since they are all in rooms next to each other. The Ecobees are very expensive but there are also the LITE versions (ecobee 3 lite). Would those work just as well in my situation? Maybe I would get the new Ecobee for the livingroom and lites for the rest of the rooms? Do houses have multiroom control with one device? Or will I need to get a device to replace for each room?

I'm just trying to understand what direction I should go in in my situation. Thanks for your help/being awesome!

EDIT: Adding more info here. I have a boiler and baseboards throughout the rooms. A majority of the thermostats are a basic scheduling Honeywell (you can set morning, evening, sleep...). Not sure of the exact model. All the thermostats are in rooms right next to each other - two being a laundry room and a tiny nursery, both connected to the bedroom. Last one is in the Livingroom down the hall.

eaubxa,1576383436,I need to get going on home automation.,"I'm a DIY kind of guy for better or worse. ;) I'm very comfortable with Linux and programming as well. But I'm coming to the realization that I shouldn't be doing it all myself. I'm also near a Microcenter that had Pi Zero Ws for $5US (3.14 on Pi day and for up to a week or so after.)  Here's what I have now.

* Running an MQTT broker on my file server (Intel/Linux) and one MQTT client that saves all messages to a SQLite database. Work in progress on scripts to pull selected info from the DB.  All of my sensors publish to the broker. That's really easy when the program that reads the sensor writes the result to the console and that can then be pumped into the MQTT client that does the actual publishing.
* One Zero W connected to a DS18B20 temperature sensor that monitors basement freezer temperature.
* A TP-Link (HS-110) smart plug for the basement freezer that can monitor power usage. A process on the file server interrogates this plug to see when the freezer is running. I can correlate this with temperature and tell when the door is ajar. I think I can tell when the freezer needs defrosting as the cycles seem to be getting longer and longer.
* Several HTU21D temperature/humidity sensors around the house (upstairs and ground level) and one tucked under the garage eave to capture outside temperature/humidity.
* A process that interrogates Dark Sky weather and publishes to the MQTT broker. 
* A couple TP-Link light bulbs - controlled via the Android app.
* Several more TP-Link outlets I can use to monitor power on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. not publish to the broker.)
* A couple Etekcity outlets that I control via Android app. They can monitor power and are cheaper than the TP-Link ones.
* A Venstar thermostat - not presently deployed. My plan was to use this thermostat to control HVAC and then home automation as a supervisory system, adjusting setpoint and turning on the fan (when heating/cooling not otherwise needed) to reduce stratification between floors. I need to pull new signal wire between furnace/AC and thermostat.
* Two Orvibo S20 outlets for which the protocol is well known and simple. I've written a program in Go to turn them on/off and I use scripts to do this when needed. (e.g. timed to turn aquarium lights on/off on schedule and the other controls charging to my laptop.)

At the moment the only things I'm controlling are the last item in the list and I also have a script that controls a crock pot to make steel cut oats overnight. (PWM control of heat input on a 5 minute period.)

Eventual goals include:

* Smarter control of HVAC based on time of day, occupancy, differential between inside and outside temperature and anything else that makes sense.
* Provide an alarm when the freezer door is ajar. (e.g. runs continuously and temperature does not drop.)
* Control of lights based on occupancy and ambient light.
* Turn on garage lights when door is opened and it is dark.
* Control solar charger for garden tractor in the shed. On sunny days it drives voltage too high. 
* Maybe other things I have not thought about.

I'm thinking that one of the home automation systems that exist would help to move me along toward my goal. Constraints are

* I want something that runs on Linux. It can be on a Raspberry Pi or an Intel Linux host. (I have a file server that is on 24x7.) If this is on a Raspberry Pi, there is an advantage that it would be easier to support when power goes out. But I'm not sure how much of the rest of the system would also work during an outage.
* At present I'm using devices that run off wall power. I'd consider moving to something that uses battery but WiFi might be out of the question. I've got an ESP32 and several ESP8266 boards to play with but haven't done much with them yet.
* I'd consider other radio technology if it provided a significant benefit. Something like the Nordic radios or Zigbee/ZWave. I think some of those are more suitable for battery powered systems than WiFi. I had avoided them due to the need for another hub but it seems they may be supported by a USB dongle, presumably with the radio only and using the smarts of the computer they are plugged in to provide functionality.
* I prefer something that operates locally rather than going through a server in the Internet. My Internet is mostly reliable but not 100%.
* We're an Android house, not an Apple house. Something that requires Apple tech is not going to work for me.
* I've done some work with MCUs such as the various Arduinos and some of the STM Discovery boards and am comfortable with embedded systems (to the extent that I earned a living programming some of them.)

I've done a superficial survey of what's out there and there are a lot of options. Home Assistant and OpenHAB both seem to be pretty popular, but I don't want to take the time to dig deeply into (or try) more of the myriad OSS options. However I'm open to suggestions.

If you think either of these is going to be a better fit for me or if you think there is another I should look at, please speak up!

If you have questions about what I'm planning or questions I haven't thought of, likewise ask away.

eazpkc,1576421072,"Daily Sunrise and ""Night Mode"" with Xiaomi Yeelights?","Hey /r/homeautomation,

&amp;#x200B;

I bought three Xiaomi Yeelights (color, v2 I think?) intending to eventually get around to trying Home Automation. The other night I did some googling and it looked like IFTTT could cover me with its applets but having connected everything it looks like it's a little too basic and limited... Can anyone help me hack it, or direct me to a more suitable service?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I want my lights to come on at 7AM on weekdays with a very low brightness and a fairly warm color temperature. By 8AM I want the lights to be completely on and ""Daylight"" White.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 8PM, I want my lights to shift to \~50% brightness and to a warm color temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

These instructions seem plausible for IFTTT, but at first glance it looks like it's optimized towards having you use ONE applet for ONE thing, and I have three bulbs... so even if I did have one applet for each task, I'd still need to make three copies of it and any time I wanted to tweak something I'd have to make sure I tweaked all of them... it just seems like more legwork than it should be considering the lights are grouped in Yeelight's app.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any automation services that can recognize Yeelight's groups, and can group these instructions elegantly?

Currently the only things I have are an aqara smart button to trigger a chime inside and the house came with a CAT5E cable running to the front door as pictured below.

I'd happily go with that type of camera however due to the position on the wall I think it may look a little funny. I've seen many people recommend a setup where they use a doorbell to trigger a noise and have a normal camera which seems like it may work but i'll just have to move the CAT5E cable. If there is a camera that would sit over the current hole and still look normal that would be fantastic.

My main requirements would be:

* Accessible/viewable when i'm away from home
* Has the ability to do automation/trigger notifications
* Would be nice but not vital to be able to have the feed recorded/stored locally and in cloud but understand it may be one or the other

I've been struggling to find a gift for my father in law when I was reminded that he changes the color of the exterior house bulbs every season/holiday/whatever.

This currently means he has to dig out the ladder and change the bulbs, which isn't great because he dislikes heights and also the driveway can be icy October thru May. 

I figured a gift of color changing bulbs would be perfect for him, but I'm not sure what type to go with. They aren't really into home automation or smart home stuff, so it's unlikely they will be adding more devices. The Philips Hue system looks good as the hub won't crowd their wifi, but at the same time that's a bit more than I can really justify spending. It kind of looks like the best cost option are wifi bulbs from Amazon.

My real questions, I suppose, are these: any ""Amazon"" brands to steer towards or away from (for quality, security, etc)? Will 3 wifi bulbs be enough to really crowd the network (they use a ""standard issue"" router from their ISP and have roughly 8 devices on it, laptops, tablets, phones, Netflix, etc)?

The idea is that you would wire the dimmer to the light kit and the on/off switch to the fan motor, replacing two switches with one:

[https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/products/zooz-z-wave-plus-s2-double-switch-zen30-white-for-light-fan-combo](https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/products/zooz-z-wave-plus-s2-double-switch-zen30-white-for-light-fan-combo)

In reality, you could use this unit for any combination of wired dimmer/switch uses you might have that are co-located in one box.   I think the switch also functions as a dry-contact relay and/or can disable the on-board relay to act as a virtual button...

My only knock on this setup is that there is no fan speed control - you set your favorite speed by pull-chain and make further adjustments in same fashion.

ebw1ib,1576590696,Feeling frustrated with ST and Alexa.,"I'm new to ST and recently added a bunch of z-wave switches and motion sensors to my already existing TP-Link switches, outlets and lamps. All in all I have around 30 devices in my small house, which control all of the lights that are used on a daily basis.

I'm having a lot of fun using the motion sensors, contact sensors and buttons to control scenes around the home, but I'm honestly disappointed with the automations in the ST app because quite frankly, they don't work 80% of the time. Additionally, I've found that trying to integrate with Alexa as a voice controller (which would be great, because I have an Alexa in nearly every room) is a mess.

To detail some of my issues:

-  Presence sensors just don't work. I want my Home Monitor to arm the system when my wife and I are both gone and disarm when we get home. This only works about 1/5 times. I’ve ensured that both of our apps and phone settings allow location tracking 100% of the time. 

-  I want to use Alexa to trigger scenes at Bed Time and when I'm Leaving for Work, etc. I also want these scenes to arm and disarm my Home Monitor, however Scenes do not have this functionality. The work around, it would seem, is to have two automations -- scene triggers Night or Away *mode*, Night or Away *mode* triggers security system change. Only problem is, this only works once in a rare while. Half the time I'm arming the system manually and my wife is upset because she's getting up to let the dogs out and tripping the ""alarm,"" which is really just text message alerts and lights turning on. 

-  The Alexa app is just not intuitive at all. I feel like every time I add a device or a scene to my home, I need to have Alexa ""discover devices,"" wherein she rediscovers devices she already knows. This results in Alexa not knowing how to control ANY devices and 2 or 3 copies of every device in my home, only one of which will work effectively in an Alexa Routine.

Am I alone in this? Am I doing something wrong that nothing is working the way it is supposed to be? Thanks for letting me vent a little!",ViennaMalt,/r/homeautomation/comments/ebw1ib/feeling_frustrated_with_st_and_alexa/,2,homeautomation,6

ebwqj7,1576594268,Home Automation Newb - Can I use Google Assistant and Homekit simultaneously?,"TL;DR: Do I need to pick one ""smart"" ecosystem and stick with it? Struggling between Google Nest products I like and wanting Homekit compatibility.  


I'm pretty new to home automation and am struggling to find an ecosystem to stick to. Do folks here try to purchase everything that works with their one preferred system, or do you mix and match? For me, specifically, I'm stuck between Google Assistant and Apple's Homekit (with Siri). I recently purchased some Nest products--two doorbells and three smoke detectors. I also nabbed a couple outdoor IQ cameras, but I'm thinking of returning them since they're fairly pricey. I also purchased an Abode Iota security system that works with Homekit and Google Assistant. As for computers and personal electronics, we're an Apple family. While I'm glad an option like HomeBridge exists, that's not something I'm interested in setting up at this time. Here's a summary of where I'm at and the advice I need:  


* Currently using Abode security that works with both Google and Apple.
* I have two camera ""systems"" I'm trying to make a final decision on: Eufy is cheaper and Homekit compatible; Nest has smarter tech and a more premium feel. The Nest Aware subscription isn't much of a turn off since it'll be competitively priced in a couple of months. I definitely like the Nest doorbell much better than Eufy, but I also prefer the EufyCam 2 outdoor cameras for their awesome wireless battery life and no need for cloud subscription All of Eufy's stuff isn't Homekit compatible, but the doorbell will be updated soon. If I keep the Nest Cams and doorbells, I'll probably get the [Starling.io](https://Starling.io) device.
* I do not currently have any other ""smart"" devices like lightbulbs and plugs, though I want to buy some. I just don't know if I need to get the good and cheap ones that are Google Assistant compatible, or if I should spend a little more to get devices that will work with both ecosystems.
* I like the Nest tech much better overall, but I'm wary about future compatibility with Apple devices, especially since the AppleTV app and Apple Watch no longer work for Google-migrated accounts.
* If I keep the Google stuff, I have a handful of Nest Mini devices (and a Google Home) to spread around the house due to promotions for the purchases.
* I really like the Homekit interface. Google Home on iOS is painful to look at.",bossymandias,/r/homeautomation/comments/ebwqj7/home_automation_newb_can_i_use_google_assistant/,3,homeautomation,1

Hope it's ok to post 2 questions in 1 thread. 

My Smart Home setup thus for looks like this: 

**Bedroom:**
- Router in bedroom
- Hue Bridge connected to router
- 2 Hue Lamps + Light Strip in bedroom

**Living room**
- Echo Input connected to Teufel Kombo 42 system
- Sony Bravia TV (connected through WIFI)
- 2 Hue Lamps + Light Strip

**1. What (smart) speaker to chose?**

Since the Echo input is connected in the living room, I have to speak up a little from the bedroom to turn on/off lights. Sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts. Currently I have not other use cases in the living room besides Hue. As I'd like to listen to music, I am considering getting a smart speaker that can then also turn lights on/off. *Any recommendations?* *Should I go with Echo devices since I already have an Echo Input?* 

**2. WIFI extender recommendations?**

A friend recommends Google Nest WIFI for supposedly being the better technology over ""normal extenders"". Not sure that is relevant for a 46sqm flat? I can currently use all devices in the living room (remember router is in bedroom), but sometimes there are peaks (Mario Kart online, Netflix, streaming sports) and the signal is too weak.

Anyway, this got me thinking about how to take this one step further (in coolness, not necessarily in security).

The system can them broadcast through my apartment that ""XXX is waiting at the front door."" If I'm not home, the system can immediately send the person away or offer to record a message.

This shouldn't be too complicated technically, but feasibly I'm not so sure. For one thing, I'd need to find a reasonably small speaker + microphone set and find a way to place it out of reach but close enough to work. Then I'd need to figure out how to power both of these as well as the FSR, considering they have to be outside the apartment. I'm not sure I could get a wire through the door and there are no outlets in the hall.

Obviously, I'm just dreaming out loud. I'm interested to know if anyone has tried a DIY system that goes this far, or if they know of consumer products that have similar functionalities, or just your thoughts and opinions on the feasibility of this type of thing.",VonLoewe,/r/homeautomation/comments/ec0qbw/feasibility_of_a_talking_front_door_security/,1,homeautomation,2

- IR blaster for AC and TV.

- Smart light bulb with sunrise/sunset simulation.

- Non-invasive universal smart lock (if that even exists?).

- Smart speaker (Bluetooth headphones with Siri/Google Assistant might work too).

- Smart outlet (coffee machine, boiler, rice cooker, desk lamp).

- Camera (security, reviewing room service).

ec9ccz,1576653579,"Newbie Question: Can you control smart devices (i.e. plugs, Broadlink RF IR remotes) using your phone's Google Assistant?","I am fairly new to this. So my current setup is I have an Alexa echo dot (gifted) that I use to control a smart plug (tuya skill IIRC)... my use case is I use voice (sometimes tuya app for ios) to turn on/off the Christmas lights on a Christmas tree, because it is back-breaking work to bend and go around a corner-placed tree to plug it in, even with an extension cord you still have to do the reaching or bending. Anyway...

In a few months we are moving to a new house. I plan to have a Google Nest Mesh Router to provide wi-fi coverage. then I will be using a Broadlink rm3 pro to control ceiling fans, AC, Radio and TV (I am verifying the the ceiling fans to be bought are in 434mhz; it seems the hate is stemming from the 314mhz hard-coding only). I plan to continue using the Tuya smart plug our (scheduled) night light and next years Christmas lights again. Then gradually add more smart devices depending on my use-cases.

Alexa isn't officially offered in my country yet, so my setup has a workaround for Alexa. Granted most of the skills for Alexa are US-centric (i.e. ordering stuff, providing localized info), I use the voice command for the smart plug and it works and I am happy about it. This unfortunately means I cannot get an Alexa app on my phone so I am inclined to switch to Google Assistant as I scale simply because I would be able to say ""Hey Google"" anywhere as long as I have my phone with me limiting the devices I need to buy and plug in, right? Broadink and Tuya both work with Alexa / Assistant so my only concern is if I don't get Google Nest, and opt for say, TPlink or other router setup, mesh or otherwise, will I still be able to consolidate my devices with just my iPhone's Google Assistant app? or do I have to get either more echo dots or a google assistant devices to cover the entire house? 

hence my question:

Can I control smart devices (i.e. plugs, Broadlink RF IR remotes) using my phone's Google Assistant directly or does the phone app is just a mic/listening device and still need to send the command to an Assistant device the Google next or google home device to execute the orders?",dorkcicle,/r/homeautomation/comments/ec9ccz/newbie_question_can_you_control_smart_devices_ie/,5,homeautomation,4

ecepd5,1576685883,Tips on building a bike hoist with communication security,"I'm moving to a new place - for the first in my life, a flat that I will actually own. No leases, no rents, nobody to tell me what I can and can't do with my own home.

It has no elevator, but it's on the first floor, so it doesn't bother me - or rather, it wouldn't if it weren't for the need to store my e-bikes in a safe place. I've lived on an elevatorless first floor before and I had no problem bodily lifting the bike and bringing it up and down a flight of stairs potentially several times a day; it builds character. This particular building's staircase is very narrow, though, so there's no way I could do that without smearing road grime from the wheels all over the walls.

The fallback fix is to bag up the wheels before bringing the bikes up and down, but I'd like a more elegant solution that doesn't require me to faff about with the bike for a short but annoying length of time every time I need to use it or put it away.

The flat has an open balcony on the side of the building; it looks on a tiny inner courtyard that is of no aesthetic relevance yet is accessible from the road. My plan is to affix two arms on the ceiling of the balcony and have an electric hoist drive two metal cables; I'd attach one to the handlebars and one to the seat via hooks, and the hoist would bring the bike up and down from the balcony - no dirtying of walls involved. Then I'd unhook the bike from the hoist and store it in the room with the balcony.

Now, I'm confident that I'd be able to build the electric and mechanical part of this contraption; I could also do the electronics, but I'm not sure about the control side.

It'd be easy enough to rig up a microcontroller or even just a timer to a relay/contactor that would power the hoist motor for a suitable length of time or until an end-of-line switch is hit; the problem is, how do I set this up so that I can control it from downstairs.

Needless to say this needs to be something that I alone can operate, lest someone lower the bike while I'm climbing the stairs before I can unhook it - or lower the cables and climb them to enter my apartment.

I thought of an Internet-connected control server using something like a RasPi; it could listen to a Telegram secret chat, and when receiving a specific string - which would be sent as a self-destructing message, so nobody could have a look at the history and know what word to use - start the hoist.

However, this feels hacky and probably not too difficult to interfere with. Is there a proven-secure app that I could use to control the hoist from my phone?

If you prefer to read - check the full article here - [https://peyanski.com/raspberry-pi-into-vpn-video-how-to/](https://peyanski.com/raspberry-pi-into-vpn-video-how-to/)

The well-known method of doing this it is to use a VPN. The most trivial solution is to use OpenVPN, but I will show you another way with a product called - ZeroTier.

OpenVPN can be really hard to set up and maintain, provisioning of new devices can be a pain with having to generate certificates and complicated configurations. 

ZeroTier on the other hand, can be installed with a single bash script, and your virtual network can be managed within a Web panel which enables you to provision devices, assign static IPs and more.

For me, using ZeroTier was a very pleasant experience. I can now access my Raspberry Pi from anywhere in the world with an Internet connection without having to worry about my local network security. And if you want to harden your security even more you can create a Firewall rule to block all inbound traffic to your ZeroTier except the one coming from your home and your ZeroTier IP address ranges. 

I really hope that you find this tutorial useful and you now have working connection to your Raspberry Pi from anywhere in the world.

-Qolsys IQ Smart Panel
-2x Honeywell Zwave thermostats
-1x Skybell video doorbell
-1x kwikset zwave smart lock
-1x zwave lightswitch
-3 years free smarthome automation through alarm.com

For $10 more than what I paid for my SimpliSafe setup, I will get the equivalent setup from KMT, but it's a 3yr contract at $0 down and $40/m, or $200 down and $30/m. 

My delima is SimpliSafe is cheaper overall, $25/m and if I ever want to add more equipment its MUCH cheaper than KMT/Alarm.com compatible stuff ($15 for a SS entry sensor vs $45 for a KMT/Alarm.com entry sensor) and prices only increase from there for products. HOWEVER, after the 3 free years, its $15/m to keep the home automation...so with SimpliSafe and the home automation I'm STILL at $40/m.

I really like the home automation side of it, mostly to be able to use alexa and geofencing settings, and would lose this capability on the connected equipment (lock, switch, 2x thermostats) if I don't pay the $15/m 3-years down the road. 

Also the sensors with the KMT/Alarm.com are multi use. I can set the sensors to activate lights and such, SS's cannot and are strictly for security. But the price for the compatable equipment (sensors, cameras, etc) is so much higher than SS and even other brands that dont require the hub (Kasa, Phillip's HUE, etc)

eclopi,1576717510,LED Bulbs Turning _Off_ at Max Brightness w/Multiple Switches &amp; Bulbs," Hi,

I recently moved to a new house and have started automating the lights and migrating to LEDs.  (I heavily automated our old house and switched most of the bulbs to LEDs.)  I’ve run into a new problem that’s a bit confusing and makes me slightly concerned about our electrical in a non-specific sort of maybe-I-should-call-an-electrician way.\*

I have two different (completely) different setups at issue on two different circuits.  However, they both show the same behavior when I replace the incandescents with LEDs: when set to 100% brightness, the lights are *off*.  As I lower the brightness, somewhere around 90-95% they start flickering.  By 80%, they turn *on* and start to dim as I continue to lower it toward 0.  Both use all dimmable LED bulbs, but different switches and bulbs.  If I replace *any* LED bulb on one of the circuits with an incandescent, that circuit starts behaving normally, with *all* bulbs going full brightness at 100%.

Setup 1: I have a [GE plug-in zigbee dimmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019G6RQCS/) with two dimmable LED bulbs ([Great Eagle 15W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QFW3VZV/)) in two different regular lamps.  They behave as described. It behaves the same if I only plug one of the lamps into the dimmer.  If I do the same thing with an old [z-wave dimmer](https://www.amazon.com/GoControl-Z-Wave-Plug-Dimmer-Module/dp/B01IU8CK2Y/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Nortek+PD300Z-2&amp;qid=1576599568&amp;sr=8-1) it behaves normally.  Plugging directly into the outlet or into my zwave/zigbee non-dimming switches also works fine.

Setup 2: I have a [Jasco Z-Wave In-Wall Dimmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077VCKFKW/) driving 5 [E12 6w LED candelabra bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SSCQ9L8/) and 2 [E26 6w LED frosted flame tip bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F9N8R87/).  It behaves as described.

As far as I can tell, everything is within device specs.  It’s possible the wall and plug dimmers have the same dimming circuitry internally; GE and Jasco are the same and lots of them share the same internals.  Many thanks for any assistance, including if there's a different subreddit this should go in!

Best,  
Jef

\*FWIW, the house’s electric was redone not long before we bought it, and we already had 1 near-fire because a circular metal pop-out in a junction box was not fully removed and cut and shorted the inputs to a (non-functioning) doorbell transformer.

ecltdh,1576718202,"Funny compatibility issue found between ""dumb"" devices","Among the many upgrades our house has received since we bought it were an electric tankless water heater, and a whole slew of smart home stuff.

When I planned out my home automation install, I considered how a couple of areas of my home may benefit from automation, but not necessarily benefit from a connected device. I could save a couple of dollars this way. A couple of those areas were my hallways, where I had dumb motion dimmers; and my front porch lights, which simply needed to come on at dusk and go off at midnight. I accomplished this with a Defiant brand programmable electronic timer switch.

Everything was installed and all was well, and these items have been installed for at least two years now. The other day, however, my neighbor approaches me and asks why my porch lights flash on and off every night around 10pm. I was puzzled and told him I didn't know, but I'd check it out.

I watched my lights periodically for the next few nights, but didn't see anything. Finally, one night my wife decides to take a shower without me, and I just happened to be in the living room. I start hearing ""CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK"" and notice the porch lights going on and off every 2 seconds. It didn't occur to me why it was happening until the next night when my wife ran some hot water in the kitchen and it happened again.

It finally occurred to me that the tankless water heater, with its massive drain on my home electrical system while it was running, caused enough of a voltage variation (I checked - it's only 3-4 volts) that it freaked out whatever cheap microcontroller the timer switch used. All other electronics in my house are unaffected.

I replaced it with a GE timer switch tonight, and all is well. No more SOS to my neighbors. I thought you all may find my story mildly amusing.

My first thought was to use Mi-Lights again since they worked well on my desk and I don't have to use my phone to access all the functionality (I oftentimes don't have my phone on me). However, I was reading that it isn't good for the antennas on the bulbs to be constantly switched on and off by 'dumb' switches. Is this only an issue for Wifi bulbs or will it also be an issue for RF bulbs like the Mi-Lights? I was planning to do color adjustments with the Mi-Light remote but for turning them on and off I was going to use 'dumb' switches. I would like to do this as cheaply as possible and buying a smart switch to replace every dumb switch as well as smart bulbs for every fixture is way too expensive. There's no way I'm going to convince my housemates to stop using the light switches and only use their phones or Alexa to control the lights. I'm also worried that I'm looking too short term and that I'll probably want to add more smart home devices in the future and the fact that Mi-Lights doesn't work with Google Home is a huge downside. On the other hand, I'm happy to have less IoT devices in my home since they are a security risk.

* Star: A central CPU (master) who would process all the info and coordinate all the actions.

As I see, Mesh would be more flexible and dynamic. I could check info about any device from any device. But also, this would mean that any device would need able of such level of complexity. Just a plug and play bulb might not do. 

On the other hand, Star with this master CPU would not require that every device is able to process and communicate, which would be easier (i think) to do the installation or replacement. But it would rely heavily on this CPU to control.

edkkwv,1576898776,"Request: Wife issued a home-camera ultimatum, need help","Hi all!

&amp;nbsp;

The wife and I recently relocated to a new part of the country. We bought our house in what is literally the safest (statistically) community within a hundred miles. Still, since I'll be traveling extensively due to a new job, she is *demanding* some sort of doorbell/front door surveillance before I leave in order to ""protect her and [our] kids"". 

Amazon's marketing team should be proud; we lived in a far less safe neighborhood for a long time without this perceived need for surveillance technology.


&amp;nbsp;


I digress.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for a wireless system that can provide real-time monitoring of the front door (or wherever I/she choose(s) to point the camera) as well as an on-demand video backup. 


I'd **strongly** prefer that nothing backs up to the cloud; I do not trust the data practices of ANY provider at this point. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not planning on pulling an [Aaron Hernandez](https://www.washingtontimes.com/multimedia/collection/gun-toting-aaron-hernandez-caught-camera-his-own-s/) but I'd really like to have the option to turn it on and off from afar.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, as I plan on this being the beginning of a whole-home automation control, I'd love for it to be compatible with a major control system (e.g. [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)) I've tried browsing Home Assistant's pages, but have come up with a massive list ([partial](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#camera)) that I frankly don't have time to go through right now.

&amp;nbsp;

This one seems like what I'm looking for: [Lorex Wire-Free Security System](https://www.lorextechnology.com/hd-security-surveillance-camera-system/wireless-system-with-white-battery-powered-hd-wire-free-cameras/LWF2080W-62-1-p). Can you recommend/disavow this product? Why will it or won't it meet my needs?

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Looking for wireless video camera system that:
* can be viewed in real time
* can store and retrieve video (at least 24 hrs back)
* can be accessed remotely
* does not upload data to the cloud (locally stored, if possible)
* has remote control to phones/other devices
* is compatible with major, preferably open-source, home-automation controllers

I'd welcome any guidance (that doesn't belong on r/relationshipadvice, please).

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks!

I have had these wired correctly but decided to replace the Wemo smart dimmer with the Kasa and now I’m confused about what I did before (overconfident and failed to properly photograph). 

The switch needs a wire that’s not in its bundle (load I guess) but is in the dimmer bundle. I don’t think I should connect them directly. How should I do it?  I think originally, a wire connected the switch and the dimmer directly. Is that the load?

Edit. Photos added. One is the current situation. The other is of the original (pre-smart) configuration - dimmer on left, switch on right. 

The only hot wire my tester identifies is the black from the two-wire bundle. None of the wires in the three-wire bundle are hot. I don’t understand this ... keep in mind that this wiring was working fine until I took it apart this morning ...

&amp;#x200B;

But first, we got a brief FAQ to address the concerns of /homeautomation members:

\- For those paying extra attention to privacy: automations are stored locally on the Hub so they do not rely on internet connection

\- Aqara sensors / child devices use Zigbee and have workarounds to be used with Home Assistant IO, SmartThings and Conbee as well as officially with Homekit, Google Assistant, Alexa and MiHome-compatible devices (Hub required).

\- Yes we know Chinese versions of Aqara products are available from Chinese resellers and their prices are lower, but they: are not localized in terms of software and/or hardware, have way slower delivery and troublesome way of refund. But they still get supported by the official US Hub, so that users have a choice.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the latest news are the following:

\- Aqara Hub (US plug version) is back in stock [by this link](https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-ZHWG11LM-Automation-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B07Y4SDXMJ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1)

\- Amazon Promo code **AQARA003** was extended and will be active until next Tuesday. Use it in [Aqara Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/Aqara)

\- Next products to arrive on Amazon will be the Water Leak Sensor and the new US Wall Switches

eduglw,1576957998,"Hey r/smarthome,","Hey guys,   
1st time posting.  
I'm a system designer for a High-End Residential AV Integrator; I really enjoy my job &amp; the amazing homes I get to see &amp; work in, so I figured I'd post a few pics of my own setup!   


  
Here's my bedroom w/ Hue lighting, 2 Channel Audio, 4K AppleTV/Xbox, controlled by Control4:  


https://preview.redd.it/ex3l42n0i1641.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53126a30934d936f268f2ee35f100e4dad95ea39

For Audio/Video: I have a 55"" Samsung, 2 Atlantic Technology Series 450 Towers, powered by a Sony STR-ZA3000 receiver.  
For Whole Home Audio: I have 2 Atlantic Bookshelf speakers in my Living Room,   
2 Nuvo Patio speakers,   
&amp; a Speakercraft 4.2 Landscape system in my Backyard.  
All rooms have the ability to stream, airplay, &amp; group via Control4 interface.  


For Lighting: I have a Hue Lightstrip &amp; (3) RGB Bulbs. I've integrated the lighting with Control4, so I can press a Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow button on the remote &amp; the lights will respond accordingly. I've also programmed a code into my door lock that will trigger the lights so I don't have to come home to a dark room. Oh, I also have my fan controlled via the Control4 remote, so I can lay in bed &amp; turn the lights &amp; fan on/off.  
I may add more Hue lights around the house eventually, but for now I'm happy.  


Let me know what you guys think,  
If you have any questions, let me know!  
I'm familiar with most professional Home Control systems; C4, Crestron, Savant, Elan, RTI, URC.

eduopt,1576959067,How to determine which devices to isolate to a dedicated network?,"I have a Unifi USG + APs in my home. I've created a whole new wifi network (SSID) that I use to connect my IoT devices. For now, these are my Amazon Echo devices and Nest devices. The subnet that these devices live on isn't allowed to communicate back to my main, trusted network. The goal is to isolate the IoT devices to a less trusted network.

In addition to all of this, I have a Harmony Hub, which I use for my entertainment center. Part of that includes controlling a Roku device. And the Roku device has the Plex channel on it, which (and this is the key here) needs *local access* to the plex server running on my main network. So the challenge here is that if I move my Harmony to the IoT network (which, by default way of thinking, I would want to do), it can no longer control the Roku. And if I move the Roku over there, it no longer has local access to my Plex server.

Basically anything I put on the IoT network, it can't talk to the main network anymore which creates a number of issues. I still have my Harmony on the main network, but my Echo devices aren't going to be able to discover the Roku now because it's on a network they can't reach.

I do have an mDNS repeater enabled on my USG which presumably should solve the discoverability issues but if the IoT LAN can't talk to the main LAN I don't see what use there is in discovering devices that Alexa can't control/talk to.

Has anyone run into this catch 22 situation? I like the network isolation for security/privacy purposes, but I don't like sacrificing useful functionality for it.

My Family and I are currently looking for a replacement for our storage heaters. Since it's pretty impossible to switch to waterbased heaters (too expensive, too much trouble to install) I'd like to stick to electric. My first Idea was to get some ""dumb"" infrared heaters, plug them into smart outlets and have homekit regulate the temperature that way.

edwvha,1576969819,Kasa Smart Plug vs Amazon Plug (Scheduling),"So I recently bought some Amazon plugs at the $5 sale price to compare to my Kasa Mini plugs. For my use the most relevant difference was the steps to create a new schedule. Below are my thoughts as I go. The bold text links to images. [**Size comparison picture**](https://imgur.com/1SuSwWL), convenient size allows the use of both outlet plugs, even when miss matched like in the image.

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Now on with the scheduling...on the Kasa side of things it’s a simple 3 steps process:

1. Load the Kasa app and [**tap the smart plug device name**](https://imgur.com/r2Wl7yA)

2. [**Select 'Schedule'**](https://imgur.com/aIifOvI) from the bottom row

3. Use the [**top right most +**](https://imgur.com/hSzXMlC) to add the new schedule options, done!

[**Options screen**](https://imgur.com/equRsK8) includes: action (on/off), time (custom times/sunrise/sunset) and repeat (days of the week).

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Now onto the Amazon smart plug…

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

IMO Trying to complete the scheduling was not as intuitive. As you have to navigate through several screens. In the end I did figure it out, here's how it went:

1. Load the Alexa app and click 'Devices' on the bottom right, then [**select ‘Plugs’**](https://imgur.com/7B9iprH) from the top row and [**tap the smart plug by name**](https://imgur.com/ZuMfK06)

2. Select the [**’Create a routine’**](https://imgur.com/OzPRD93) on the bottom. This [**opens the routines page**](https://imgur.com/L997L63)

3. From here using the [**top right +**](https://imgur.com/ff9rMMA) and 'Create the new routine' shows three variables (name, when this happens, add action)

4. After setting the routine name, there are several triggers under [**’When this happens’**](https://imgur.com/VlH821X); using the [**’Schedule'**](https://imgur.com/PPqbfcl) option allows you to select either time, sunrise, sunset. Each of them will [**open a new page for time selections**](https://imgur.com/YvlZE9b), including a repeat option (days of the week)

5. Then I assumed you'd only have to select the [**’Add action’**](https://imgur.com/ChrLf2r) option to turn it on/off at said time. But [**none of the items listed**](https://imgur.com/F81p1k3) here reads ‘plugs’ as in the main screen of the Alexa app. Although there is a [**’Smart home’**](https://imgur.com/hAge457), the smart plugs where not there either. 

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

With nowhere to go next, had to stop and think a bit...

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Most likely here’s where the average consumer would start to get frustrated, but after a bit found a way for it to work.

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

As you can see on step 5 'Smart Home' image, there is a ‘Control group’ option. With that in mind, I added the smart plugs to a group and was able to complete the scheduling without further issues. 

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

So after adding the smart plug to the Alexa app scanning the QR code. It's:

6. Load the Alexa app and click 'Devices' on the bottom right, then [**tap top right +**](https://imgur.com/BawR87O) and choose ‘Add group’, give the group a name and select the smart plugs from the device list presented.

7. Continue from step 2 above and carry on, as [**the new group**](https://imgur.com/7e7EjvM) will now be available on step 5 under [**smart home &amp;amp;gt; control group**](https://imgur.com/2b2FCnb) allowing you to save the routine.

8. Scheduling via [**routine create successfully**](https://imgur.com/lUorkbL). Then you have to do it again from step 2 above to have it turn OFF at a different time, etc.

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

IMO Amazon should review this rather cumbersome process and make it have a more simple approach by adding a single settings screen after clicking the 'create a routine' suggestion on the smart plug device screen. Or add the Smart Plug as an option on the 'Add action' settings screen with the current setup.

eebi3t,1577054419,Don't Order from Philips Hue Website,"What follows are the details of the absolutely horrible experience I've had with ordering from Hue. 

I already have about 50 regular bulbs for my home and decided to get two ceiling fixtures for my office. After a fair amount of research (including a question here), I decided on the Flourish ceiling fixture. 

10/10/19 - Order placed on the hue website for two fixtures. 

10/16/19 - The products arrive. Both fixtures' sconces are broken. One has two clean cuts through the product and one is broken in many places. Boxes were both put in a shipping box with no additional packaging. I am in awe that any could arrive without being broken. 

10/17/19 - We call Philips and after explaining what has happened the rep put in a ticket. The rep said we'd be updated via my email address that they confirmed. 

10/19/19 - We still had not heard anything so I called in. It took a couple of phone calls and no one could tell us anything about my order or the ticket. I have to demand a manager to actually get one. When I do get a manager they inform me, (for the first time during dealing with this), that the number I have called is not for Hue and there is no customer service for Hue. This rep agrees to put in a ticket on the Hue side for me. 

10/20/19 - I get a generic email from Hue. They have no clue about the issue and ask how they can help. I inform them the product arrived broken and that I have had a hard time getting anyone to do anything. Radio silence for the next THREE days. 

10/23/19 - I get a generic email telling me thanks for my inquiry and now I have a ticket number for my issue. 

10/30/19 - After another SEVEN days I get an email with a link for the return. No explanation, no apology just a link to return the product. We return the product and schedule a pick-up.

November - I send several emails asking if the product is going to be refunded or if they intend to send a new product. I hear nothing. I ask if I need to do a chargeback ... nothing.

12/6/19 - Almost two months after my initial order and I have no lights, no refund, no new product, no explanation. I send one more final email to give them one more chance before I have to take more of my time to file a chargeback. I hear nothing back. 

12/21/19 - At this point, I had resigned myself to having to do a chargeback but low and behold a new package arrived. Two brand new lights arrived at my door. While I certainly still angry at the experience, I was pretty stoked. At least I'd be able to get them installed finally. I mean I already have 50 bulbs, what was I gonna do sell them all and start over? 

12/22/19 - Opened boxes. Both fixtures are broken as is a piece of my soul. Both product boxes look like returns- one has shrink wrap, one doesn't. The one that does has been completely removed and is laying at the bottom of the box. Maybe it is my original return and the past truly does harmonize.

What now? - I hate the idea of getting a different brand of bulbs after I am this far in, but I certainly don't want to give them any more of my money. I'd love to hear your ideas. 

In the meantime, if you are a Hue customer please don't make the same mistake I did by ordering directly from Phillips. If you are new to smart lighting, I would strongly suggest you consider another brand altogether - I truly love the products, but the service is some of the worst I have ever received.

eebqou,1577055616,Connect Nest Mini to my Phone?,"I get this question may be asked alot but every search I try finds answers for a different problem.

I'm currently using a UE Boom as my main source of music (followed by my headphones, computer and xbox). Being a fan of UE Boom I am tempted to buy another and have music playing on both sides of my house (Budget, not keen on expensive speakers yet).

Google Assistant on my phone seems to be fine with playing next song when I ask it too, even set it up so I don't even have to pick it up. The problem is my Nest Mini is TOO good. I can almost whisper into my phone and my Nest Mini will jump in and tell me nothing is playing (while my UE Boom is playing heavy bass), so my phone will automatically think it doesn't need to do anything.

Is there anyway I can connect nest mini to spotify on my phone?

It worked fine for a long period of time, so a sudden incompatibility makes zero sense. Instead all I needed to do was reset the device (which is what I would have ended up doing on my own).

First, I am having a hard time selecting a Dimmable LED lighting system that will work with HomeKit, Google &amp; Alexa and is extensible to the dimensions I have in my kitchen.

Second, I'd like to run the LED strips all through my kitchen. The total length of the LED strips I require is roughly 25 ft divided into 4 sections - 13ft, 5ft, 5ft, 1.5ft. I'd like to power them by a single outlet so I need to connect these individual sections by unlit extension cables that I can run through my cabinets. These extensions are roughly 1.5ft, 7ft, 11ft. None of the strips that I saw had extension packs had cables of the lengths I am looking for. Different brands have different connectors and don't seem to have a standard connector. I am totally open making my own extension cables if I know the connector and all I need to do is buy the cable and solder the connector on it. I'd likely just plugin the LED strip into one of the power outlets in the kitchen. Would this be a bad idea?

Finally, I am planning on adding Lutron Caseta. It would be nice if this strip would work with the Caseta bridge but this is not a hard requirement.

eergk7,1577139057,Recommendation for HDMI switch with specific requirements,"I'm looking for an HDMI switch for a very specific use case. I want to use it to switch my PC from my secondary monitor to my TV, so that I can play PC games on the couch, and I'd like to have a remote for it. The problem is, my PC is upstairs and my TV is downstairs, so an IR remote won't work (I ran an HDMI cable through the wall for my PC when we remodeled the basement). I assume because the PC monitor would be on at all times, that auto-switching won't work. Are there any that work with, say, a Bluetooth remote, or connect to WiFi and have a phone app or something?

Edit: For anyone looking to do something similar, I found a solution that works for my setup. As I said, I only had one display port and one HDMI on my video card... However, I did have another HDMI on my motherboard. So, I forced that port to be enabled in the BIOS, hooked up my secondary monitor to that and my TV to the one in my video card. Then, for switching back and forth (because I don't want the TV acting as a monitor when not in use), I downloaded a program called DisplayFusion that allows for monitor profiles. I set one profile up for my PC monitors enabled and the TV disabled, and a second one with my TV on as primary and my secondary monitor disabled. This also switches my sound output device automatically. Then I set up hotkeys within that program to switch between those profiles. Next, to swap them remotely, I already had Unified Remote on my phone/PC, so I wrote a custom remote for it. It basically has two big buttons on it, each one triggering one of the hotkey combos I set up. Now I can quickly swap my PC to display on the TV when I'm downstairs via my phone.",Rivent,/r/homeautomation/comments/eergk7/recommendation_for_hdmi_switch_with_specific/,2,homeautomation,20

I had a several year old v2.3 (USB) PLM that actually died, and while the new v2.5's were shipping I got another 2.3 as a replacement, which worked for a while until dying a month in, at this point I knew something was up, and in frustration I bought another one during the black friday sale (and got a v2.5!). Still didn't work, the symptoms were the PLM could receive messages but not transmit any into the network.

Today (a few weeks after getting the 2.5 rock solid) the automation all died again, and I was on the hunt. All my basement plugs (including the PLM) are on one 20A circuit.

The instant it was unplugged everything went to normal.

What was odd is that even with the PLM unable to TX, all the dimmers on the same circuit would respond to scenes from other controllers elsewhere in the house.

What i basically want for my living room is the ability to control temperature and hue with my voice or phone, regardless of whether those lights were turned on or off at a switch or not. --- but I dont want to HAVE to use just my phone or voice to do all that. I also want to be able to control them from a switch as well. 

The best solution i can think of is smart bulbs with smart switches (why is that a bad idea) with motion sensors that will turn lights ON when i enter but then disable the function for them to turn off if no motion is detected. 

Is that possible? Is that impractical? Are there better solutions? Whats the issue with using smart bulbs with smart switches

_________________________________________________

So im new to this whole smarthome thing and wanna get into smart lighting (especially for my living room) but there are so many things i can foresee being a nuisance. (BTW im currently running Alexa with an Echo Dot an a Sonos One SL). 

1. Say i just get a few WiFi smart bulbs only. Firstly id have to connect all of them to the 2.4Ghz wifi - would that eventually congest it? Secondly if i want to use them in my room which is maybe 15 - 20 meters from the WiFi router - i foresee the WiFi in the bedroom being patchy and having to do lots of resets and reconnecting and stuffing around with apps and ultimately being a bit unreliable. (If i have a smart bulb, and someone does switch it off at the switch. If i switch the switch back on again do i have to reconnect it in the app and reboot stuff and do i lose all my settings etc? Or does it just go back to how it was before?)

2. So say then i get Philips Hue with a Hub to overcome the unreliability and wifi clogging issue. Last night while in bed i forgot to take my medication. So i hopped out of bed, switched on the living room lights, switched on the kitchen lights - took my meds, then switched off the kitchen lights then the living room lights. 

I realised that that 10 second exercise would have  been such a pain in the butt to walk into the living room, then use my phone to turn on the switch, or voice would be even slower and less practical. Then do the same thing in the kitchen, then the same for turning them off in the kitchen then living room again. (How long from start to finish does a voice activsted light take to turn on btw?)

3. So maybe i go smart switches? But i dont reeeaaallllyy see the point in them either. Can i turn dumb bulbs on with voice even if it was switched off manually at the smart switch? But then if i use dumb.bulbs i cant change the temperature of the white light (which is something i would like to control) 

4. So maybe smart bulbs with smart switches? But ive heard thats not a great idea (not to mention getting very expensive) 

5. So maybe i use motion sensors? But then there are so many times i can remember being annoyed as hell by timed motion sensor lights. In the toilet and they switch off and im waving my hand about to get them to turn on while trying to do my business lol. I can foresee them doing the same thing while watching a movie and sitting still on the couch.",monawonderlick,/r/smarthome/comments/eeu2m0/smart_lighting_need_opinions_advice_please/,3,smarthome,3

We have a friend with motor disabilities where controlling their TV with voice would make life MUCH easier. Side note- surprised at the lack of info in regards to smart home automation for people with disabilities when they’re who could benefit from it the most.

Here are the things we have that we’re trying to make work. 

Samsung smart Tv series 6- need to update software and not working but getting there (hopefully)

Google Nest Hub

Logitech Harmony

Chromecast- TV has Netflix and YouTube apps but just in case we cannot get to work have this to use. 

We have set up each device on its own but trying to integrate it is our issue. 

They’re also all linked with the google home app. But we’re struggling with-

Asking harmony to change channels; that app is hard to understand yo. And generally asking it to do anything but turn on/off.

But then the TV is on google home via smart things so from what we can see we can change channels/ input direct via that yes?

And if we can do that can we open the tv YouTube/Netflix apps with our voice that way too? Or would change input to chromecast channel be the easiest way?

Harmony app still helpful for stereo etc.

Any assistance with understanding/setting up these apps would be much appreciated. 

We’re on time constraints to set this up and are frazzled.

Also if anyone has any tips or smart home ideas in relation to this that they think would be helpful for people with disabilities please advise!",beeanchor87,/r/smarthome/comments/eexw27/voice_control_tv_for_disability/,5,smarthome,5

eezgqf,1577181753,Searching for a cheap security camera that tilts and will record in night vision (or has a clear-ish picture in the dark).,"Me and my partner are suspicious of my neighbour. My partner's car has been damaged twice since living at our flat and we suspect it was the neighbour because we've been a bit loud a couple times when we had some friends over, that and the guy is a bit of a alcoholic with anger issues. We are respectful neighbours most of the time but every now and again we'll have friends over on a Friday or Saturday.

Anyway, I'm look for a cheap camera (£20-£40) that will record out of our front room window onto our drive. We are on the top floor so it will need to tilt downwards and it will need to have night vision, or at least have a fairly clear picture in the dark. I don't want a camera that uploads footage directly to the cloud, one that records straight to SD will do fine. Having it linked to an app that alerts you of movements would be nice but it really isn't essential. I've seen a few on Amazon but they all have mixed reviews and i'm not sure which to pick.

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",BabbaTheCut,/r/smarthome/comments/eezgqf/searching_for_a_cheap_security_camera_that_tilts/,20,smarthome,18

My dad has early dementia.  I need to know if he starts wandering at night.  Also, he had attacked my mom like 3 decades ago.  He hasn't done it since but with onset of dementia, I'm not certain if he may again someday and want to make sure he gets no where near my mom.  

How can I set up such a system?  Also should I get an amazon echo, google equivalent or something else?

I can't just get a notification, I need alexa or Google assistant to speak up loudly on both my phone and my echo or google equivalent in addition to me getting a text notification.  I won't see just a little text notification to pop up though so I need sound as well.

I am using life360 right now and it usually sends me a text but I need more than a text.  Dad uses an apple phone.  I'm using a Google phone though I may switch to Apple someday I'm not sure on that yet.  I'd like to not be fixed to a brand of phone.

Also, I'm going to have to use some samsung Smart things devices because they are the only system with water sensors right now.  It in theory should be compatible with both alexa and google though I haven't used it yet.  

Thanks

Edit:  I also plan to add automatic shades to my dads home, the Samsung Smart things water leak sensors, some audio/video device that let's me and my dad see/talk to each other through a screen and that screen has to have drop in functions as dad has dementia and I may need to be able to force him to accept my call.

ef0txy,1577190959,Ring monitoring subscription vs DIY (over 10 years),"I don't know what I should be buying, Ring with subscription or build my own security system (4 PoE,IP cameras, NVR) to avoid monthly payment. \*I may be moving to a new home after living in my current one for 10 years, so the cost comparison is based on *10 years*, not lifetime.

The equipment price (cameras, sensors, software, etc.) between ring and DIY (NVR/PoE) doesn't seem to be much different. The resell value, or value added to home, looks similar as well.

The installation fees might be higher for DIY (I will still need professional help) by few hundred bucks (?) because I will have to wire everything.

Utility fees (electricity) are gonna end up similar although ring probably will use less electricity if some of them are battery run.

Two major differences are that ring has $100/yr subscription and DIY has none, and I think I heard that you get discounts on home insurance if you use professional monitoring/subscription while you don't usually get one if you monitor yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit often recommends that I build my own and ditch monthly professional monitoring (ADT, SimpliSafe, Ring, Nest, etc.) but from what I see there doesn't seem to be a much difference when I look at Ring (or $10 Nest) subscription.

***What am I missing? Am I not accounting for other fees other than taxes?*** 

Is the quality (cameras, updates, etc.) worse for Ring vs DIY? Am I miscalculating initial costs to build my own? Is DIY recommended more not because of the price but because of more privacy and control? Is DIY for people who will be living more than 10 years in their homes?

When I first started looking at home security, I was for sure DIY was more cost-effective , but when I'm looking at it now, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference in total price.",random_user00,/r/homeautomation/comments/ef0txy/ring_monitoring_subscription_vs_diy_over_10_years/,4,homeautomation,14

Basically it needs to fit in following criteria:

My house is 300m2, (2 floors with 150m2 each) so it needs to be able to clean one floor on one day, and the second floor on next day. My home is mostly hard floor (wood and tiles), no carpets. Because I have 2 floors I would need a robot that can save 2 maps without having to scan the area every time. Having been able to mop the floor of 150m2 at once would also be a big plus, but I know it's a bit unrealistic with the amount of water these can hold. 

Also, being able to select the type of cleaning for one room, mopping for the other room etc. would be great. I have no experiences with robot vacuum cleaners, but being able to share it in app with the rest of the family members is also a must.

At the moment I have my eyes set on these: Roborock S5 Max (which apparently is not avaiable in EU yet), Deebot Ozmo 950 (seems to have the best reviews) and Roborock S6.

ef59r8,1577212856,ITS ALIVE!! WTH Did I create!?! A Smart Home nightmare!!,"Let me start by reviewing these products:

Wiz lights - Cheaper than hues, work great so far.  Had about 8 that burned out in the first hour or so of using them but they were all from the same shipment so I suppose it could have been damaged or a bad ""batch"".  

Hues system - While more expensive, I gotta say, its really nice to have these other options like the outdoor LED strips and audio integration points.  Also, the wifi range on them seems to be further than the Wiz lights by a couple of yards or so.

Echo Dots - PERFECT! Cheap, put them in pretty much every room.  Problem is now that more than one will hear my voice and sometimes that causes issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to my question, where is the potential bottleneck or problem in my setup.....

I cannot get this network to remain stable and am pulling at straws to determine why...

MU-MIMO compatible device------CHECK

High Throughput mutiple band wireless router------CHECK

Solid bandwidth from ISP------CHECK

&amp;#x200B;

The tech:

Arris 6183 Cable Modem (tested 300+ Mbps connection downstream and 25+ upstream)

Linksys EA9500 Router

1 Hues Bridge

8 Hues devices

40 Wiz lighting devices

6 Echo devices 

2 Echo enable Sonos devices

4 Personal computing devices

4 Mobile devices

1 Smart TV

2 SimpliSafe Camera

4 SimpliSafe moisture Detectors

1 Ring doorbell with camera

&amp;#x200B;

Everything worked fine until I added an additional 20 lights to the home.  Now the router randomly shuts off or drops connection.  Sometimes part of the house will be working while others aren't.  Very intermittent.  I checked the router settings and had to increase the limit of # of connected devices to max (155 as I recall).  Also while playing online games or streaming to the TV there is packet loss and latency occasionally.  Again this is pretty random.

&amp;#x200B;

My guess is, although the EA9500 says it can handle 155 simultaneous connected devices, it really cant.

I've read that people have had success in moving the Hubitat closer to the device to pair, which I'll need to wait till this weekend to attempt.

Broadlink RM Mini 3 Question,"I got a broadlink blackbean for christmas, as my hopes for it are to use it to turn on my arizer extreme q vaporizer, which runs on a remote.  I've setup the remote in the app, but its VERY hit or miss..  sometimes i have to hit power 6 or 7 times before it works, doesn't seem to matter where I position the blackbean.

Once I do get it on, I only use a couple buttons on the remote, and I've programmed those in.  One of those buttons is the down arrow (it turns the temp of the vaporizer down).. typically its a press it once and it goes down 1 degree.. but for some reason its taking it down 5 degress at a time, when thats not even a button available on the remote.

Also, I can't seem to find a way to get the scenes into shortcuts.  Theres no direct link for broadlink devices, so I was going to link it to google home, and then send that command to shortcuts, but when I pull up the scene in google home, I can't seem to find a way to do that like I was able to do with my xbox (hey siri, turn on the xbox triggers ""hey google turn on xbox"", which then turns on the xbox).. I was hoping to do the same with the blackbean

efkl04,1577301903,Starting your SmartHome - WiFi vs Z-Wave/Zigbee,"TL;DR I talk about why you should not use wifi devices and how to start your smarthome.

Hello all SmartHome enthusiasts!

Many people often ask the age old question ""How do I start creating a Smarter Home?"" It may seem complex or perhaps they don't know what to automate. 

You'll often see posts where someone purchased a heap load of Wi-Fi devices and are ready to start their journey, followed by posters questioning the use of Wi-Fi rather than a Wireless protocol such as Z-Wave/Zigbee. Usually the common response is price. 

Well why would I want to pay more for these other devices, what advantages are there? There are several reasons why:

- The less wifi devices you own, the less congested your wifi becomes
- At any given point a company can cease to exist or stop supporting a device. Now all of those wifi devices are useless. At the very least a Z-Wave/Zigbee device can be used as a dumb device like a normal light switch, for example. Imagine having to repurchase all those devices again. 
- When the internet cuts out, so does access to the Wi-Fi devices 

Ok, so now you're interested in non-WiFi devices.  Where do you start? I won't go over the different companies as there are many. The first steps you should take are figuring out exactly what it is you want to automate. Do you want motion sensing? Want your front porch lights to turn on and off automatically at certain times? Perhaps you would like temperature/humidity sensors and create routines based off of that. Understand that you don't need to purchase everything right away (as much as you see posters showing off their bulk purchases). I'm two years in and still finding things to automate. After you've set a plan, make sure your wiring includes a neutral wire, otherwise your options to choose from are more limited. If you own a newer house, this is not of worry. 

For those of you with an much older home... Lutron and Innovelli are the way to go for switches that don't require a neutral wire. My personal go to for switches is GE Z-Wave Plus.

To use these devices, you need a hub of some sort. It can be as easy as a Z-Wave Hub (Stick) or as complex as Home Assistant/OpenHAB/Hubitat. For most beginners who just want things to work, my recommendation is the Samsung SmartThings hub. For clarification, Google Home / Amazon Alexa are NOT hubs. These are merely voice assistants that use the cloud. They can integrate with your home automation platform. I don't believe these devices are true automation, but that's a topic for another time. 

Hopefully this helps someone out there. I know there's a lot more I could have touched upon, but then this would have gone on far too long.",win_sys_admin,/r/smarthome/comments/efkl04/starting_your_smarthome_wifi_vs_zwavezigbee/,23,smarthome,20

I have been setting up some automation in my apartment (tenant). I have a few IKEA lights and outlets (Zigbee), 1 Livingwise dimmer (Zigbee) and 2 Mi Outlets (Wifi), running on a Pi4 with HA and a CC2531. I have been trying to stick to Zigbee and avoid Wifi as much as possible. I got the outlets by mistake and couldn't return them.

When installing a second dimmer I noticed that most of my light switches don't have a neutral wire. I also need some of them to be 3-way. I did not find that many dimmers that match my needs. A lot of people seem to go for Lutron Caseta but I am really hesitant about adding a proprietary hub that doesn't support anything else (I guess?).

What's wrong: Adapter fails to pair in the app. Always ends with an error that it failed to ""commission"" the wi-fi adapter.

What I've tried: I tried using the programming code both via QR scan and via typing it manually, and even reversing the case of the letters (per suggesting read on a forum that someone said was given to them by Schlage tech support). I tried hooking up a whole separate wi-fi router running only a 2.4 GHz network, and making sure my phone is connected to that before trying to pair the adapter. I've tried manually making sure my phone's wi-fi is connected to the adapter and not my router at various points in the process. I've tried changing the password on my wi-fi network, and even removing the password. 

No dice. Every time, I can see the adapter, select it, then see my wi-fi networks and pick one, and it always fails after that.

The only reason I'm even trying this is because the house had a Schlage Sense keypad lock installed on the front door when I bought it, so I figured I may as well grab the adapter for that. I have an August lock on my other door and it works flawlessly, so I'm deciding whether to just grab another one of those instead of messing with this any more.

Holy shit I was wrong. 

I downloaded the required app on my android, and tried to run through the setup for the outlet. It didn't work. The app says essentially ""well it might have worked, since it's blinking right, but we can't find it so maybe try again idk"". Cue try #10 to get this outlet setup, to no avail.

I got the brilliant thought ""hey, maybe if I link the app to my SmartThings app I can just set it up in there."" (I know, but I really needed something for my lights and didn't have time to order another one and see if it'd work)

So I went through the steps to link the two, and the second they were connected, all my Sylvania (Zigbee, via SmartThings hub) color smart bulbs blinked off, and came back on. Hmm.

Every single device on my SmartThings hub has been deleted. That's ~10 bulbs, 7 leak sensors, a main water cutoff, a bunch of multipurpose sensors for temp, window open/close status, etc. All Gone.

I already have a Kwikset Smartcode 916 Zigbee smartlock (I don't have a hub yet). What I'd like to do is install 3 switches (dimmers would be nice, but not necessary) for my track lighting and living room ceiling fan (my current switches only have 2 wires so I'd need something compatible like the Lutron Caseta or Inseton Smart Dimmer), a thermostat (thinking either the Nest or [Sensi/Alexa combo](https://www.amazon.com/Emerson-Thermostat-Version-Energy-Certified/dp/B07Z4G4CBZ/ref=sr_1_29?crid=11F7C37UPK5XX&amp;keywords=nest%2Bthermostat&amp;qid=1577338347&amp;s=hi&amp;sprefix=nest%2Ctools%2C179&amp;sr=1-29&amp;th=1), already made sure both are compatible w/ my home), and 3 additional standard wall plugs. I want all of these things to be controlled using a single system (i.e. Alexa).

I'm not opposed to spending a bit of money, but I'd like to keep the cost and clutter to a minimum. My priorities are just getting it all working together. I'm thinking if I get the Sensi/Alexa combo linked above along with 3 Alexa compatible plugs, 3 2 wire smart switches, and a Smarthings hub everything will work together. Does this make sense, or am I missing something? Can I get away with less somehow (will the Hub be required)? If I have a Zigbee hub, do I still need a hub for the wall switches (most of them like the Lutron Caseta say they require a hub but having 1 hub for switches and 1 for Zigbee seems excessive). Can anyone recommend a setup where I don't need multiple hubs? What's the simplest way to do this?

I just want to make sure I have all my ducks in a row before I start ordering things that aren't compatible.

Wish-list summary:  
Smartcode 916 w/ Zigbee (Already have)  
3 wall switches  
3 smart plugs  
Smart thermostat

efs2id,1577342458,Should I get a SmartThings or an Echo Plus? Needs to be dead simple for kids,"Starting to build a very basic system that will basically control lights/plugs to start.  No intention of moving beyond that, but tinkerer curiosity will probably eventually kick in for me or the older daughter (11).

System needs to be dead simple as it's always hell playing tech support for kids who always seem to find new ways to push systems beyond their limits.

I initially bought 2 Echo Dots and plugs/switches, however, we are in an older home and the light switches don't have a neutral line in or behind the switch box, so smart switches are totally out of the question.  That's why I'm now pivoting to smart bulbs.  Going to start pretty small and see what does/doesn't work, but feel like I need to decide on wifi vs hub lighting.

efvoww,1577368640,"Thoughts on the best implementation of smart devices on AirBnB Property ($3,500 Budget)","Hi All,   
We are in the middle of remodeling a house. Instead of ""flipping"" it, and therefore having insane income tax (35%), We are going to try short term renting (STR) it on sites like AirBnB, VRBO, HomeAway, Etc for a year or two and having the sale classified as a long-term capital gain (10% tax). 

**I've got $3,500 in the budget for ""smart home"" upgrades,** which will hopefully allow us to STR it more easily. Things currently being considered are:

* Smart Locks
* Exterior Cameras
* Smart Doorbell
* Smart Thermostat
* Smart Smoke Detectors
* Smart TV
* Mesh Wifi Network

**My Questions Are:**

* What are your thoughts on the best approach? Should I try and keep things in the same ""echo system"" (Nest/Google Vs. Alexa). Or should I use a bridge (Echobee/Smartthings Hub) and pick which items I want to use regardless of the ecosystem?
   * We currently use mostly Google Products, are there any avid Alexa/Amazon fans here that can point to a significant reason to switch? 
* Right now we have mostly Google products in my primary residence. Should I create a separate Google account for the rental house, or create a new ""home"" within my Google Home App? 
   * If creating a new ""home,"" Has anyone come across instances where you get conflicts, such as asking Google to lock the doors and have it lock the doors at a different home? Or playing music at one house and having it on at the other? 
* What other devices would you recommend for a rental property? 
* Do you think it's worth putting smart speakers (Home/Alexa) in the house for guest use?
   * If so, how does this work regarding guest access to whatever account it is linked to? 
* What other thoughts/observations/experiences do you have with this type of project? 

&amp;#x200B;

**About the house:** 

* 2 Story W/finished Basement (3 floors Total)
* 4 Bed, 2 Bath. 
* Brick Construction
* Many upgrades to the house, so willing to rip out a wall in some instances to install things if need be. 
* 300MB Internet Speed, No Datacap. 
* House has an Outdoor Pool and Patio. 
* Located at the end of a dead-end street in a decent neighborhood.
* No Garage. 
* Two Exterior Entry Doors. 
* House is set up as a ""mixed-use"" duplex. 
   * The upstairs of the house is set up as an in-laws apartment, with its own kitchen and bathroom. We are planning on keeping the two floors both accessible (by removing the door that separates the entry) making one big house, instead of two smaller units, but want to keep the kitchen for resale.

Basically I decided to go with LIFX because they were reviewed as being brighter, but they just decided one day to not connect to HomeKit, and all the codes are in the boxes as opposed to on the bulbs, so you don't know which code is for each bulb.

They also sometimes malfunction, especially when commanding through HomeKit. Eg. I tell the Apple TV in my Master Bedroom to ""turn off the lights"" and it'll just turn one of the two in there off. Sometimes it'll do both, or one and then a second later the other.

I was expecting better. Does anyone else have this gripe? And also, would anyone recommend having a LIFX and Philips Hue setup? Bridges, everywhere. I am tempted to sell the bulbs and just admit defeat and switch to Hue.

efzske,1577388861,Inovelli switches + SmartThings + Hue RGB. Unexpected behavior.,"I have a challenge on my hands with a new setup. We've just bought a new condo (2016 construction) and I'm working on setting up my second full-home IoT installation. 

I've been a big fan of Inovelli as a company, community participant, and the promise of disabling local control for smart bulb use. When I had the opportunity to outfit a whole new setup, I excitedly bought 15 Inovelli switches. But now I'm worried that the switches themselves aren't behaving as expected. I also fully accept that I may be missing something, so I'm posting here.

I'll also acknowledge that I'm using a dimmer switch with the intent of configuring it to behave as an on/off switch (allow smart bulbs to manage dimming via hub commands). For only a few dollars more, I want to ""future proof"" the installation, so dumb &amp; dimmable bulbs can still be used in the future. Essentially, my goal is to do it right the first time, but the promise of on/off behavior doesn't seem to be panning out so far.

Challenge:

* Hue bulbs turn on ok (aside from a little ramp-up flicker. Unexpected, but that's not my main concern)
* After a few minutes (inconsistent?), the bulbs will flash/flicker and ""reset"" to white.
* Sometimes, they just turn off outright, even though SmartThings and Hue still report switches and bulbs ""on"". Cycling the switch off/on  is the only way to turn on again.

Working theories:

* Fluctuations in power supply
* Inovelli switch itself misbehaving
* My own ineptitude: misconfig of device, bad wiring job, etc.

Devices in use:

eg030g,1577390205,Getting started with Smart Lightning and some other minor things in my bedroom,"Hi everyone and happy holidays!

So, in a couple of months I'll move into my new home and I want to make my bedroom ""smarter"". The room is 3mt x 4mt and has a small closet in one of the corners.

There will be a ceiling light in the center of the room and another light inside the closet. Both will be controlled by switches next to the entrance. On the same socket are located other switches controlling the opening/closing of the ceiling window and the opening/closing of that window's curtain.

My idea is to get two smart bulbs, probably an RGB one for the whole room and a white one for the closet, an RGB strip to stick behind the desk and an Echo Dot so I can use Alexa and voice controls.

Now it's time for the questions...

* How do these smart bulbs actually work? I imagine I'll have to leave the manual switches always on, but what happens when the power goes off and then back on in the building?

* I was thinking about adding a Smart Switch that would replace the standard switches I've mentioned before. Are there some things I should know about how they work with Smart Bulbs?

* I know that Philips HUE are really good, but they're also quite expensive and require their hub to work. Will any product sold on Amazon (obviously with good reviews overall) work just fine for a simple smart bedroom?

I don't know if these questions are pretty dumb or what, but I like to do things in the most efficient way possible and without rushing.

Have a nice day!

Hope you all are enjoying your holidays. I've got quite a few pieces of smart technology, but I consider them more manually activated, than acting smartly and autonomously, so I would love your expert advice on what I should use to tie it all together.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lights**: Lutron Caseta Switches and Dimmers (\~14 units) w/ Hub
* **HVAC**: Ecobee3 w/ 2 remote sensors
* **Cameras**: Indoor Nest x2; Nest Hello
* **A/V**: Logitech Harmony
* **Garage**: Meross
* **Alexa**: Echo Show 5, Echo, Echo Dot
* **Smartphone**: Galaxy S10 (iPhone XR, secondary)

Today, we use the Alexa ecosystem to control lights and HVAC. Exterior lights will go on/off at sunset/sunrise, managed within the Lutron App. Not particularly pleased with Logitech Harmony's performance, standard commands plus integration with Ecobee/Lutron - so it's mostly collecting dust.

I'd like to get notifications from the interior nest cameras only at certain times of night. If we're away, I'd like the Ecobee to set to away mode and for select lights to go on between certain hours (ie, 10pm-6am) if motion is detected at the front door (my Nest already defines that ""zone""). Thinking of things along these general lines. 

Not sure what else I should be contemplating, but I've got some decent gear and I'd love for it to work together and intelligently.

The two white's are outside on either side of the front door (inside glass housing).  I set them to come on at sunset and off at sunrise.  And I no longer have to flick that stupid switch when I go to bed and off when I come downstairs in the morning.

Now for the fun ones ... the color.

I spent some time deciding on where to put $120 worth of light bulbs (jesus h christ that is ridiculous).

I finally decided on the Master Bedroom.    The three rooms we use the most are Living Room, Office, and MBed.  I am never in the living room.  I am a business owner and most of my work is done here at my home office.  So not to sound greedy but these were my present and my wife is the ""I don't really care about any of this smartthings crap"" person.  So the living room was off limits.  Plus it has 23 foot ceilings and the fan those 3 bulbs would go in is far out of my reach and my ladder will not reach it.

So they are in the master bedroom as the main light (we have two lamps on the nightstands, but otherwise these 3 hue color are now the main overhead lights.)

The master bed is centered ""under"" the lights.  And at the foot of the bed on the opposing wall is the fireplace and TV above it.  Just so you get an idea of the scene.  Decor is all white, grey, black, chrome, etc.  

So any neat tricks or scenes or whatever?  I literally got these installed an hour ago and I am just spinning with all the things you can do.

Any tips or tricks or cool things you learned along the way?  Just playing with them I set up a scene where it turns on the fireplace (it is smart switch controlled) and turns all the bulbs on to 10% brightness and red.  Sort of a heat glow.

Now, my contract is up on the alarm system, so I'm looking at switching my service. I've looked at Simplisafe and like their offering and pricing, but it still seems that there's not clean integration for them into a HA system, at least for the following:

\- Door/Window Sensor Open/Close (I use this to turn on certain lights/outlets, without the need for a 2nd door sensor just for HA vs. alarm)

\- Alarm System Status Change (I use this to adjust the settings on my ecobee based on the alarm system setting. For example, if my alarm system is set to away mode, then adjust the heat down to a lower setting since no one is home).

So, the question is - does anyone have a solution for this that works well? Are any of the alarm systems out there good with integration into ST or Hubitat (or something else for that matter)?

1. Obtain GPS location
2. Bluetooth connection for mobile (cell phone) controls
3. Connect to the internet (Wi-Fi) and:

   2. Connect to a mobile application on the same network
4. Store mp3's and replay them based on a timer
5. (later) Always-on Microphone for speech recognition and commands

**Hardware/Software Selection Priorities:**

1. Convenience in programming and hardware configuration
   1. Note: my programming experience has been STL (ladder) and some Python but I am rusty.
2. Community support - for hardware and software development
3. Cost - ideally, the lower the better but this is the least of my concerns at the moment given the average cost of these development boards.

I've had a HS100 for a while and love it. So I bought 3 more of them.

I recieved the units (Hardware version 1.1 and 2.0). I begun setting them up, but only one worked. 

The other two failed the setup Kasa setup with the message ""Unable to Connect to Your Wi-Fi Network"". I factory reset them a bunch of times and kept on trying to no avail.

The next day I plugged one in again and by some miracle it worked. Once they get the error message as stated before they stay in the Wi-Fi green flashing state. But when I plugged this one in it blinked a few times then connected.

I contacted TP-Link support who didn't have any advice for me apart from what I already tried on my router. Such as enabling and disabling AP Isolation (Guest Network) as well as switching the 2.4GHz band of my Wi-Fi to channel 11 (I configure by 2.4GHz network on channel 8). Neither of those helped.

I got a replacement unit sent to me for the one that still did not work. This one was hardware version 4.0 and firmware version 1.0.2. I've updated the rest of the already working plugs to firmware 1.5.5 and they're still working great. 

But now I have 2 HS100's that cannot connect to the Wi-Fi. I checked the router to see if they did connect and register with the routers DHCP. Both HS100's which did not work display on the router only as their MAC adress with no IP assigned and no internet connection. 

TL;DR

I've tried many locations in the house, tried reseting the devices, tried multiple devices both iOS and Android. Still nothing. As soon as a HS100 gets setup it works perfectly, my first and second unit worked flawlessly, the third to setup on my network worked on a micracle after a day and the last two won't connect to the Wi-Fi and are stuck with a flashing green indicator LED.

* can I turn on my kettle via a smartplug, if normally it required me to push a button to manually activate the heating?

egd3os,1577463638,"The Truth on Nest, is it a Good or Bad system?","I posted this over at /r/homesecurity for their insights but I'd really like the input from this sub on the system as a daily driver.

We're in the process of a build and I'm exploring home security (and network) from the ground up since I'll have the chance to run wires where needed. Cost is always a concern, but simplicity and ease of use are paramount. I'm not going to get family approval to buy anything if it's a convoluted mess of scripts and actions to check something out. This is where I feel Nest has an advantage - if you buy into the ecosystem it appears as though everything just works, and works well.

I have a first-gen SmartThings hub that ran basic lighting and timer routines., I never really got far with security since we weren't planning to stay there long. I set up everything on the family devices as well but it wasn't the most well-received implementation I've ever done, which is what brings me to consider Nest.

First - it's expensive, got it.

Second - I'm reading a lot of conflicting information about the move away from ""Works with Nest"". Many are quite to hate on Google stating it's a securing of the system, move away from cross-compatibility, closed-source, etc. Others are stating that the API is being replaced with ""Works with Assistant"" as Google matures its Assistant platform.

Third - is it a good system? Does the base station with keypad/fobs work effectively? Is there any cross-compatibility with other sensors or am I stuck buying 100% Nest products?

If anyone who has first-hand knowledge of this platform can share their experience I would greatly appreciate it. If others with a good technical understanding of the 'smart' industry and home have additional insights those are greatly appreciated as well.

Goals: voice control of as much as possible, Android phone/app control of as much as possible (ideally via one app), ability to create routines and trigger-based activities, ability to monitor energy consumption. Remote (off-network) control and visibility would also be nice, assuming it's able to be adequately secured.

egmx0j,1577511800,Automating the RF controlled Ceiling fans.,"So, I rent. Home automation is tough when you rent. But so far I have been pretty crafty. I installed Hue bulbs in every fixture I could. I butchered a hue bulb and a home depot special under cabinet led light strip to make a hue under cabinet light. I bought some INNR plug adapters for my boot dryer, and the plug in vanity light. I wrote my own automation controller in Python. Using Axis cameras for video. A couple motion detectors that work on 433Mhz and  sonoff bridge (fairly useless - more false alerts than anything else). So the next couple projects are to help sort things out and refine the system a bit. My thermostat is a Wifistat, they aren't great. Talking with them I had to reverse engineer the protocol and it is slow to respond. The ceiling fans, the previous tenant put some remote control thing in them. Every time PG&amp;E kills the power out this way, I come home to flashing Hue bulbs that make me feel like I am at a rave. The RF module controls the lights with an SCR. Leakage current and LED lights don't always get along.

My solution was to purchase a spare remote off of Amazon and wire it up. At this stage in the project, I have simply gutted the remote, and put wires on everything. The relay box below is straight out of China, called GeekTeches NC800. I haven't even tested if it works yet.  So I will update this thread as I go along. Maybe add some more of the things I had to do as a renter to make sure I don't do anything permanent.

The relay is finished and tested. From my computer with Curl I can control both ceiling fans and all functions. A picture of the finished product is attached. The relay seems pretty solid when used with Safari or Curl, I had issues using Opera, so expect some problems using it in chrome as well. IE should handle it but it is outdated, so the only real option here is Curl. This suits me fine, as I will likely write a python script for it. I can post a link to any library I write for it.

egw3a8,1577566403,One App to Rule them All,"I need some suggestions for an omnibus Smart Home app that is the best compromise for my mixture of devices and systems and am simply looking for suggestions on what works for you or what definitely does NOT work based on experience or the mix of smart home devices and systems that I am trying to unify. I realize this is complex so I am asking for merely guidance on what tools I should try first with a reason why you think it’s a good choice as well as any known shortcomings. There are just so many “smart home integration” apps out there that I don’t have the time to try them all right now. Job doesn’t allow more than a couple hours a day for setup.

Finally, minimizing function loss vs using native app is key. I’m not afraid of a tool that requires some skill and patience to set up as I code. I just don’t want to spend the man-hours making something scratch or requires me to write code to make a GUI. If there was an app with a DSL and a nice UI dashboard builder that would be the holy grail. I will settle for a tool uses a GUI to program as long as it offers granularity and supports system specific concepts like Hue scenes or Nest Aware. The limitations of Apple’s Home app or Google Home are dealbreakers, but I am not against a tool that uses HomeKit or a Google Actions.

As a bonus, I was hoping to use Alexa voice commands for simple controls, similar to how I presently use Siri for iConnect Hue or Harmony to trigger Hue Scenes.

This is what I currently have:
- 2 hue hubs which host a division of 5 hue switches, 3 hue motion/ temp sensors, two zigbee switches for fluorescent lamps. This is presently controlled beautifully with iConnectHue
- Nest with Hello doorbell, lock for front door, and a DropCam Pro. It’s now managed by Google Home as well as Nest. I am considering a Nest thermostat but would pick another if it integrated better with Hue and outside smart home tools. 
- Harmony Elite which controls single AV system, on which it presently has:
  - Apple TV gen 4 (main entertainment device)
  - Chrome cast gen 2
  - Roku gen 3
- 2 Alexa Dots and a Blast speaker which sort of has Alexa functionality
- multiple iOS mobile devices

Primary goals:
- Must work on iOS or at least a mobile browser
- Cleanly more than one Hue hub
- “Single pane of glass” for core functions without major shortcomings (like Google Home and it’s stupid one Hue hub)
- Integrations (for starters)
- Integrate existing Hue thermometers in existing motion sensors with a smart thermostat. (I’m looking at Nest Smart Thermostats but havent pulled the trigger.)
- Create a simplified dashboard for iOS or mobile browser that a non-tech can use without screaming

Secondary goals:
- Access to video feeds and, if possible, Nest Aware stored video
- execute some commands using Harmony Elite and Alexa (or Siri) for macros like turning the house down for bed, turn on AV system and Apple TV, secure house, intercom to one or all Dots, etc...

Won’t step on these automation functions or can employ them by itself:
  - Retain motion sensor controlled light, specifically for a stairwell where two sensors work in tandem (Hue native app doesn’t do this- I need iConnectHue)
  - Scheduled and/or motion-triggered Hue scenes and animations
  - Event triggers to either send email or push notification of photo or video clip (or link) if motion detected on a camera when no one is home.

Again: I’m not seeking “THE solution necessarily, just some guidance to save time on trying stuff out and/or spending money on software that doesn’t cut the mustard. My thoughts are the more granular the tool the better. (This is why the Apple Home and Google Home apps are terrible, but an app that effectively uses HomeKit and Google Actions would be awesome.)

What I'm trying to do is: step on the scale -&gt; track weight somewhere  -&gt; set a 3-second countdown timer w/announcement (Google Home) -&gt; take a picture with a stationary smart camera (Wyze?) -&gt; upload that picture to my Nextcloud (-&gt; add to a ""Time-lapse"" progress gallery).

The idea is to track the weight automatically (thus the wifi/ZigBee/whatever) make the data look nice (google fit/whatever) and then take a progress pic with a fixed camera.

I don't care too much for accompanying apps and/or esoteric body-fat/bone-density measurements (that are usually not very accurate). Just a simple smart scale would do it for me.

So far I've been able to find the Withings body that seems to meet most of my criteria, maybe sans the necessity for a companion app (I assume).

I'm new to home automation/smart home, so I hope you could help me out. Scales don't seem to be talked about very much (I Googled for quite a while) so I figured asking here couldn't hurt.

Any help is greatly appreciated.",Kaifeck,/r/homeautomation/comments/egx4j9/looking_for_a_smart_scale_with_automation/,5,homeautomation,5

egzl3f,1577583388,Looking for a smart outdoor flood light with motion and remote control.....,"I'm looking for a flood light that has motion and a remote control, or maybe a flood light with a detachable motion detector.

Our driveway runs parallel to our house.

So the light only comes ON when you are at the very end of the driveway, and any other cars entering the driveway won't turn the light once a car is parked at the end.

If I was able to mount a detached motion detector that runs on batteries at the end of the driveway, the light could come ON when a car gets half way in.

or if I could find something that also works by remote, I could turn it on manually when I was backing in at night.

Its been a long time since I looked into theses lights and curious if home automation could solve this problem.

Mainly because most of the articles and videos i've found are from around 2017 and i understand that ikea has done a lot of updates since than.

What i want is:

1. to replace 2 bulbs in the hallway which would be triggered by a tradfri sensor, what i would like though is have different brightness settings during the night (dimmed to about 20%) and the day (full brightness) when the sensor gets triggered by movement. is it possible to program or schedule this in the tradfri hub?
2. to replace the current ""analog hard switches"" with smart switches on the wall. i cant find those on the ikea website, are there any other brands that are compatible with the ikea home hub that look like regualr switches? or can i just use the round ikea switches?
3. can i assign multiple switches to a bulb or groups of bulbs? or can a bulb only be assigned to 1 remote.
4. would it make sense to buy the tradfri lights and a phillips hue bridge to have the comfort of more programming possibilities?

I know from experience that this is all possible out of the box with philips hue, but i dont want to spend 300 euros on it. right now i have all i need for about 130 euros in an ikea shopping cart but i dont know if what my ideas are compatible with tradfri.

I’m looking for some general guidance if possible. I highly value integration and I need low operable solutions for my wife to buy in. I currently have the following devices:
- 4 Nest cameras
-7 Nest protect smoke detectors
-3 Yale locks with remote access
-Newest Google hub(uninstalled)
-Newest Google WiFi mesh devices
-IPhone 11 pro Users
-Misc Alexa Hubs for my daughter to sing Frozen songs
-LG laundry/dryer/dishwasher with remote app support(untested)
-13” IPad being used to stream Nest camera app

What I love about what I currently have is that I have an easy to use app for the security stuff. However, I do not have the following features:
-Moisture/freeze detect in crawl space/utility closet
-Door opening chime/notification
-light automation inside or out(no lights purchased outside yet) 
-HVAV automation
-Garage door automatic close/status indicator
-Fan automation
-Laundry/dishwasher start at time of day
-Alarm clock integration with lights in MBR. I want the sun to rise in my bedroom at 5 AM. 


I do cyber security for a living and I’m very well versed on the shit the Chinese/etc. are doing with WiFi devices and I’m opting to avoid implementation even with VLAN segmentation mitigation. Ideally the wall switch solutions could be aesthetically pleasing without costing $300/pop.

eh2f1z,1577599204,Looking for input for automation - particularly smart light switches.,"Hello all,

Just starting to look into setting up a bit more automation in my home, but I’m finding that researching all options in this market is overwhelming - so any tips/tricks/clarification/recommendations would be much appreciated.

I want to start off by adding smart light switches to our master bedroom (as well as a smart switch for our ceiling fan), smart switches for our master bathroom, and finally a smart switches to our kitchen lights. However, there’s a caveat I should mention first. 

When our house was built (circa 2013) the electricians wired two different circuits in our master bathroom. One switch independently controls the vanity light, and a pair of 3-way switches controls the ceiling light. I didn’t like how I’d have to always hit two lights to evenly light the entire room, so our builder installed some Insteon (smart?) light switches that would bridge the separate circuits as one logical switch when used.

Our lights in our kitchen are wired similarly - peninsula lights are on one circuit, ceiling pot lights are on another. At present they function individually, but I always wanted to just combine those in much the same way as the bathroom - all switches control everything.

Anyway, my concern is that upgrading these various switches throughout my home (especially in the master bathroom) will undo the present functionality. I understand that with smart switches you can create groups/zones to simultaneously control multiple light switches from your smart phone or assistant device, but do the physical buttons on the switches mirror that ‘paired’ setup of the chosen circuits that was done in the apps? 

For example, when guests come over I just would like them to use the physical light switches and get the expected behaviour (paired circuits turning on in unison), no matter which physical switch they hit.

Finally, I should mention that we use a mixture of google home devices throughout the house as well as Siri on our phones. It would be a bonus if we could still leverage both services simultaneously - for example, google assistant when using voice in the house, Siri when out-and-about. If it came down to choosing only one, the priority would be google assistant.

eh7ldv,1577635680,Hindsight is 20/20,"So about a year ago, I jumped into the home automation thing.  At this point, I have swapped out 18 wall switches, a couple of smart plugs, installed the ring doorbell, 3 Sonos speakers, and a few blink cameras outside, all with voice control through 3 Alexa units around the house.  Problem is, I failed to do any research up front and everything I purchased was 2.4g wifi, which also hosts all of our phones, TVs, readers, etc.

As a few of you are no doubt realizing with amusement, my most recent wave of installations seems to have run into a connected-device limit on my ISP-provided Cox Panoramic wifi router.  I cannot connect a 41st device without deleting one of the 1st 40.  The Cox rep I spoke with couldn't/wouldn't confirm the limit (or help in any other meaningful way), but I've demonstrated it to myself several times at this point and feel like its definitely there.

So now I have a box of goodies I cant install until I solve the device limit issue.  I'd rather not start ripping out the wifi switches and replacing with another comm protocol if it can be helped.

So my tech-impaired question is thus: To get more devices on the network, can I just install access points? A new mesh network?  Just a more capable router? Or am I screwed and just need to start replacing switches with non-wifi devices?  Help!!",AeroMaeven,/r/smarthome/comments/eh7ldv/hindsight_is_2020/,5,smarthome,14

We have a basic setup- Echo Dot and two Philips Hue Bluetooth bulbs model LWA002.

Well today there was a little power glitch or something and the lights flickered twice quickly, barely noticeable except the lights turned on both times. Alexa turned them off the first, maybe second time by voice command, but then would not.  In the Alexa app they would say “Device Unresponsive” or something like that.  However, they still connected and worked perfect in the Hue BT app.

I cannot get them to reconnect to Alexa. At first amazon’s customer service said to in-learn Hue skill, then “forget” the devices and re-learn/connect everything. Well I didn’t have the hue skill since we don’t have a bridge, and now that I forgot the devices they don’t show in Alexa at all. We tried resetting the bulbs from in the hue app, on/off 3 times, and countless other methods to no avail. They will add back to the Hue app fine every time but Alexa won’t find them by normal discovery OR Bluetooth.

ehjrx3,1577696802,Smart home scenes and automations in the cloud?,"Hi all,

I've been running Domoticz on a raspberry pi for about 5 years, and had my automations running on it pretty smoothly. For some reason though just about every year there would be something that made me have to do a fresh install of Domoticz, which is a freaking hassle. You have to install Debian lite, monit, network connection and mess around with a whole ton of crontabs over aan SSH connection which is a giant pain if you're not a Linux expert like me. And each time something goes wrong you have to spend hours and hours figuring it out. I was having problems again, started a new install, got stuck and this time I was so fed up with it that I decided to just not do it anymore. 

Alternatively I tried installing home assistant, but even though the install is really easy also that seems to take a steep learning curve to get some stuff going.

My goal (unlike many) would be to do home automations with pure cloud services. Google Assistant on my Google homes spread around the house works very great with Philips hue, Harmony hub and I'm sure also with smart plugs. So far so good. The only thing I have not been able to do so far is scenes and automations. 

For scenes I tried Google Assistant routines, but the only thing missing is a ""wait"" there. For example: ""turn in TV plug, wait 10 seconds for the TV to start up and then change input to HDMI 1"" etc. I think also IFTTT only allows one action so no luck there. 

For automations I guess I will have an even tougher time since there is no local server keeping track of device states, so for example you cannot turn plug B on if light A is on, cause there is no way to check if the other light is on, I guess. 

Anyone found a cloud solution to these problems yet?",Derpezoid,/r/smarthome/comments/ehjrx3/smart_home_scenes_and_automations_in_the_cloud/,2,smarthome,5

I already own some smart gadgets that use with google home mini, and recently I\`m more interested in a better solution that can operate locally and run on a raspberry Pi.

I will list everything I have that I hope to find a solution to make them all work together and see what is missing or needed:

* 2 google home mini
* 2 chromecast 2
* 1 chromecast audio
* 4 yeelight smart bulb multi color (WiFi)
* 4 WiFi smart plugs (ALFAWISE) using tech life android app and integration with google home app
* yeelight light strip (WiFi)
* Anki Vector (Alexa built in)  (BONUS)

I tried HA but I don\`t know how to integrate services or make the smart plugs and yeelights work with the system, and still I cant figure out how to work with YAML or where even to find it.

I apologies for the weak English and thank you in advance for your comments and help :)

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great day everyone.",seekahaa,/r/smarthome/comments/ehkrae/needing_advice_on_how_to_start_home_automation/,2,smarthome,0
ehkutb,1577704502,Need lots of help with Smart Switches! [AUS],"Hey all, I'm so glad I found you guys here, I'm so deep down a rabbit hole and confused about which kind of smart switches to get. I'm very new to this and don't understand much about light switches, so I've been researching a whole bunch. Let me just cut right into it

The switches will be preferably on the TUYA/ Smartlife platform as it integrates best into my system.

First off, What are the characteristics of Austrlian light switches etc, has neutral wire?

For one gang switches:I have a couple of options:

1. [https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07SNQ114R/?coliid=I3IG2RCDLKT8Z0&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1&amp;ref\_=lv\_ov\_lig\_dp\_it](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07SNQ114R/?coliid=I3IG2RCDLKT8Z0&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)

just a question with 1. – What are all the markings used for, is it compatible with Austrlian standards

2. [https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07CMSSRCF/?coliid=I1GDEW0JX0M76X&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1&amp;ref\_=lv\_ov\_lig\_dp\_it](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07CMSSRCF/?coliid=I1GDEW0JX0M76X&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)

3. [https://iswitchoz.com.au/products/google-alexa-wifi-1-gang-light-switch-aust-certified-iswitch](https://iswitchoz.com.au/products/google-alexa-wifi-1-gang-light-switch-aust-certified-iswitch)

Which one do you recommend? Some of my switches are of the size of 3. but some are also single architrave switches

In my lounge room I have a 3 way switch setup connected to 4 led downlights. One of the two switches also has a dimmer. Both switches are single architrave with one having a dimmer on it as well. What kind of switches do I need then?

I really like this one, but is it compatible? [https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07R4ZCD2C/?coliid=I1M4CN6R71GERH&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07R4ZCD2C/?coliid=I1M4CN6R71GERH&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1)

Here is my amazon wish list of things I could buy: [https://www.amazon.com.au/hz/wishlist/ls/1TF7CZENBX2OX?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.com.au/hz/wishlist/ls/1TF7CZENBX2OX?ref_=wl_share)

I also saw videos of a sonoff mini switch that could still work with a normal light switch (the physical switch may become inverted after using the smart relay functionality but flicking the switch from off to on position will turn the light off), does anything on my list allow that functionality?

Last question: Do electricians deny installation of equipment that works with australia but not have the appropriate safety certifications?

Lucky last: I recently bought 4 dumb led downlights that are dimable, can I get a sparky to wire them into something like this? [https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07PLCMR71/?coliid=I30H1C1S5KWGTD&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1&amp;ref\_=lv\_ov\_lig\_dp\_it](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07PLCMR71/?coliid=I30H1C1S5KWGTD&amp;colid=1TF7CZENBX2OX&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)

There currently seems to be no best recommended solution for adding physical switches, and with them being WiFi bulbs, they can be tempremental with turning power on and off.

This power outlet can be controlled using a standard on/off light switch from just inside our back door. 


My question is; can I somehow connect a dimmer, smart or dumb, to this, in order to dim the festoon lighting? I assume the dimmer would need to come ‘after’ the smart plug in the chain of power in order for me to use a dumb dimmer on it.

SmarterEveryDay [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozIKwGt38LQ) made some noise lately about the possibility of hacking smart devices with lasers.  It's cool and all that but as many of you correctly commented on the video post - not that dangerous. 

The video inspired me to actually investigate what steps could be taken to prevent laser hacking &amp; voice injection attacks.  To combat these I have created 2 possible solutions:

* 2FA for any action (voice action or automated trigger)
* ""Holiday Mode"" single, password-protected command to disable voice-enabled actions of your choice

Unlike with Google and Amazon enabled devices, the password has attempt limit and rate limit, so that's a bonus too!

I've tried googling, searching Grainger, Honeywell, and other sites but nobody makes it easy to search for what I'm looking for.  Any ideas?  Also, I'm pretty sure it's DPST since I have 4 wires on the thermostat.

ehzt56,1577778105,Whole-house setup for brand new homeowner.,"Hello r/homeautomation. I am a first time homeowner way too excited to customize my house and bend it to Siri's whim.

My plan includes and is definitely limited to:

* Multi-room audio via Airplay2 (used to be a chomecast audio fiend, but no faith in google nowadays).
* Most light switches via not wifi. (15) ?
* Every dimmer via not wifi. (4) ?
* One air Purifier via Awair Glow C.
* HVAC Via Nest (comes with the house, but I want to replace with ecobee).
* Smart lock. ?
* One security camera. ?

I dont know too much about home automation. But here is my ideal setup:

I get home, use my phone or a keypad to unlock my front door. Lights come on automatically or with a ""Hey Siri"". Preferably I can specify which lights by either time of day, or different Siri commands (HomeKit scenes). I open spotify and cast music to my TV and my AVR turns on, I also multi-room to my bedroom. Siri automatically sets the temperature, preferably it can take into account humidity. Someone knocks and I check my peep-hole. Its Jeff. Jeff is a notorious frivolous sue-r and I am calm because the security camera pointed at my front door can record him not getting injured on my property. Jeff leaves. I leave for vacation and my water heater lowers its temperature to 100f. My thermostat to 65.

What a story.

Here is what I know:

* Apple homepod for the bathroom, bedroom, kitchen. (any of these can be the homekit hub)
* Apple TV for the living room and bedroom. (ditto)
* Zigbee or Z-wave light switches and dimmers.

Here are my known-unknowns:

* Not sure how to have the lights take into account time of day. (I believe Hubitat can help).
* Not sure how to turn on my infrared-only AVR. Been googling for zigbee IR emitters and i see some on alibaba but thats about it.
* Not sure how the thermostat temp would read the Awair's humidity reading. (Hubitat pls
* Not sure which lock to use.
* Not sure which camera to use (preferably only records when motion happens)
* Not sure which hub to use (probably hubitat).
* Not sure which dimmer is best, though I was considering: Leviton DZ6HD-1BZ or Lutron PDW-6WCL or any suggestion from you beautiful people.
* Not sure which switch is best, though I was considering: Leviton DZS15-1LZ, Lutron PDW-5ANS or any suggestion from non-Jeffs out there.

Preferences:

I would rather stick to one brand with my switches and dimmers, so as to prevent all my receptacles from appearing too disjoint.I would rather this all still work if At&amp;t dies. It will. It does. Get google away from me. I would rather not have a node server doing stuff, if the Hubitat cant do it natively, I may as well just use a smartthings and use EH right?

Notes:

I know if i go lutron I would need a hub to connect to my Hubitat.

Could you help me formulate a concrete game-plan? Offer solutions or suggestions to my known-unknowns? Point out some unknown/unknowns that you see making me stumble in the future? Where do I point my dwindling bank account to? WHAT BUY?

I love you.

**What is Tasmota?**

If you are new in the Smart Home &amp; IoT world you probably wonder what Tasmota is?

With one sentence - It is an alternative open source firmware that allows you to locally control your ESP8266 based devices using MQTT, HTTP or Web Interface. 

**What is ESP8266 device then?**

This probably leads to your next question, What is ESP8266 device? The **ESP8266** is a low-cost [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) microchip with full [TCP/IP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_stack) and [microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) capability. So an ESP8266 device is simply a device with ESP8266 chip inside it.

I love the idea of a smart home and started with Hue Bulps and got an Alexa later that year. Now I got a Sonos from IKEA and the naming struggle is real. Am I missing something or how on earth do you name your devices so that you can call them through alexa, Siri or what so ever?

For example:
The Alexa in our living room is called “living room”. Now I can’t call a Hue Room that way or if I do so I am not able to call this room via Alexa because it can’t recognize if I meant the Alexa or the Hue Room. The list goes on if I name my Sonos Box living room because it’s suited there and Sonos limits the naming of the speakers to presets. So I can end up with several devices with the same name or I have a different name for each but need to remember if it’s a light, a speaker, a scene, a room or an Alexa. 

Any ideas how to solve this? How do you do this? Seems simple but I can’t figure out “the right way”.

I have several ‘smart’ components running in my house, with a few Hue lights here and there.

Now that the dust has settled, I do have one Hue light that flashes at a specific time of day, 3 times a day. I know this came from a previous automation I set up, but I can’t find out what app is controlling it. (I want to say Stringify, but I believe it’s down now, and have no way of checking).

Finishing a (re)build of my entire house after my neighborhood burnt down in June. Fun times! Anyways - I have a lot of google products like the hub, nest doorbell, etc. In our temp. apartment we have it connected to the Samsung Smart Things, Philips Hue, etc.

In the rebuilt home, I am going to have Action Tiles installed on 2 android tablets to control those devices + a bunch of z-wave stuff. To make a long question short - will I still be able to control devices using my Google home hub when they're also connected to my Action Tiles software?

ei4jpy,1577807525,(Question) Installing outdoor Kasa Cam,"So I'm about to install an outdoor camera, but the cable is not able to be disconnected from the camera itself (probably for security reasons). The other end is a USB connector, which means I'd have to drill a pretty large hole in the outside of my house, even though the cable itself is quite small

Would it be sketchy to cut the wire, feed it through the small drill hole, and then reconnect the individual wires using electrical tape? There should only be 2 of them since all the data is wireless and there's no Ground pin on the AC adapter

Edit: It worked! Was actually super simple to do, and as a result I have a much smaller hole",Ig0BEASTmode,/r/smarthome/comments/ei4jpy/question_installing_outdoor_kasa_cam/,3,smarthome,1

Given the processing power of my phone, rasperry pi devices, cpus, smartwatches, etc, there has to be a way to make smart switches with a slimmer intrusion footprint for easier wiring.

Yes, I know one answer is that if I'm not skilled enough to jam all the switches and wiring into a 3 gang then maybe I should hire an electrician, but I'm hoping that since home automation is a DIY kind of thing that some manufacturer somewhere is focusing on small-footprint smart switches.

I have been in the process of replacing all the switches in my house with Lutron products and have been having an issue with a Caseta dimmer in a single pole location.

It is replacing a switch that controlled a single overhead light fixture, but when I flip the breaker the switch does not appear to be active (no leds) but the overhead light it should be controlling is on.

I swapped the dimmer out for another which works in another location and I continue experiencing the same issue.

I spent an hour on the phone with Lutron support and they finally just recommended I call an electrician, but I figured I would check here and see if anyone experienced a similar problem and knows a fix.

Thanks in advance for any input!
