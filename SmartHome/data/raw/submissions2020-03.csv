fbmyaq,1583027346,Finally replacing my wink hub 2 but having trouble. Help please?,"I just purchased a Hubitat to replace my wink hub. I have about 20 zwave devices, and removing them from the wink has been a very frustrating experience. Some devices just refuse to get removed, where during winks removal process, it times out. Other times, it seemingly gets removed, but come back as zombie devices with generic names. 

Most of my switches or dimmers are GE or Jasco. 

Another stubborn device is the Dome motion sensor

Please help it’s driving me crazy!","We have lumimans smart bulbs in two rooms that we bought in January and use with Alexa. We’ve had no trouble with them at all. The other day they suddenly stopped connecting and now can only be on at cool white. We have tried doing a manual reset probably 30+ times. We’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, creating new accounts, and clearing the cache in the app too. We even tried taking the bulbs out of the lights and putting them back in. I’ve tried downloading different apps that are also supposed to be compatible. Every time it says the device is detected but when the set up gets to 98% it says something like “uh oh! Could not connect!”. The bulbs do not show up on our list of WiFi networks. I can’t get a refund for the bulbs as I’m past the 30 day window. 

The only thing we haven’t tried is resetting the router but it’s impossible for us to do this as we live in an apartment building with shared WiFi and the router is in one guys apartment. He’s been completely unresponsive as has the apartment management.

fbxzlf,1583086363,Help with speakers and an amplifier,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am making a custom install into my brand new house we are building. I have taken apart 5 google nest hubs so i have access to the output speaker wire and that way i can use the touch screens as a ""chromecast audio/ cool control center"" for my smart house. I have the nest hub wires going into my server room into an amp (Dayton 12 Channel home amp) then from the amp to the speakers put into my ceiling. The speakers are all Bose 591 in-ceiling speakers. Simple setup and it works awesome! I ask the nest hub a question or to play music and it comes on the ceiling (SUPER COOL). Yes the echo devices have an aux out but i want to stay in the google ecosystem.

Now here is the issue. In my kitchen i want to use the hub max (10"" touchscreen"") the same way. So i take it all apart get my speakers wires and set it up the same way and low and behold it works! However because the hub max is putting out more power it sounds absolutely terrible. The only solution i have found that works is to get a class-D amp with treble and bass settings to fine tune. Its still not perfect but sounds miles better then the Dayton audio (and cheaper).

My question is does anyone have any experience in routing home audio?

Another solution is that since the hub max is already amplified (built-in) i could just skip the external amp all together and connect direct to the ceiling speakers. This works somewhat well but its just not loud enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advanced!

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:

I bought both the [Kicker](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00LIAHSM4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and the [Scosche](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00I4EF1BC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) line out converters.=

The kicker one was terrible. Lots of hum and static through the speakers. The Scosche one was interesting. The sound quality was SO much better using the Class-D amp. If i used the Dayton Home Media amp it sounded no different then before. Terrible.

Now the sound is next to perfect despite a hum/static coming from the speakers when nothing is playing. I tried putting the resistor back in but didn't change anything.

I'm going to try with this [PAC](https://www.amazon.ca/PAC-LP7-2-2-Channel-Output-Converter/dp/B00F0YASQ2/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1RH1EQOJ8FD8T&amp;keywords=line+out+converter+car+audio&amp;qid=1583289081&amp;sprefix=line+out+con%2Caps%2C212&amp;sr=8-7) one and see if that is any better.

fbzz6c,1583094103,Routine to run multiple routines?,"Hi all,

Is there a way in either google home or alexa where I can create a routine that runs other routines?

I know most people can just create a single routine to do most of the things they want, but I have a particular use case where I want to turn on and off my computer.

I use to use stringify that would trick google home or alexa into thinking that an IFTTT recipe was a smart home device.  That service is now unfortunately dead.

I can still create an IFTTT recipe that triggers my WoL/SSH app, but can no longer add this as part of a routine inside Google Home or Alexa like I used to.

So now, I have to trigger my routine (to shut off lights, tv, etc.) then say another keyword to trigger my IFTTT recipe to shut off my computers.

I know, I know, first world problems, but we are automation nerds for a reason right?

There has to be another way.

I kept digging and found that I can use a Wemo smart plug to trigger recipes.  However, there is a HUGE delay.  I timed it.  Using the wemo smart plug, it took on average 23 minutes for my computer shutdown recipe to trigger.  I have searched high and low and asked on every forum I can for a fix to no avail.  I have no idea what causes this delay.

If I just use the webhook recipe without the smart plug, the packet is sent to automate instantly.

I have tried creating a routine where I added the trigger word for my computer shutdown recipe and that does not work at all either.

I am out of ideas.  Is there a way I can have my old configuration back?

fc06sz,1583094931,Konnected.io or alarm based solution for wired sensors for smarthings?,"I use smarthings for my home automation and currently use smarthings sensors throughout the house for external doors and motion in every room. Only using this for automation but am interested in using it from a security standpoint too. But am looking to move over to wired sensors to increase reliability and no more battery changing! 

Konnected.io looks awesome but I have around 13 rooms in the house and would ideally like a motion sensor, windows sensors and a glass break sensor on each window. Some rooms have 4 windows but I assume I could tie all 4 windows into one zone for glass break and one zone for open/close sensor. So I would need 3 inputs per room, so 39 inputs. Plus a couple of external door sensors. This would require 3 or more of the Konnected pro boards (I like the POE and Ethernet over wireless part). This is quite costly and also I wonder about trusting smarthings as my alarm system? 

I believe the alternative is a DSC powerseries alarm with the envisalink module? From my understanding this allows a huge amount of zones and would report them all to smarthings. I like the idea of the alarm function being separate to smarthings as long as it will all report sensor states to smarthings quickly to enable automation use?

I want to replace it before it starts getting to hot to work in the attic.

I'm looking for suggestions on if there are any automation ideas I should look at. I've got the fan in the master bathroom on a [simple timer](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XRGFLVY). Will do the same with this one most likely unless I find a good reason to do it a different way.

I've only recently started getting into home automation. I have a Hubitat, a single z-wave switch and a zwave plug. The switch has the relay disabled and acts as a scene controller for the plug.

In the bathroom where this fan is going, there are 2 switches. One for the lights above the sink and one for the exhaust fan. Ideally, I would like a fan that has a light socket so it can be used as a nightlight (with a red LED bulb). Unfortunately, with the exhaust fan running from a single switch, I can't think of a way to supply power in a way that the light comes on but the fan doesn't. Maybe if it's a really quiet fan that won't be a problem.

Also, whatever I get must be energy efficient. Even though I’m sure a bathroom exhaust fan doesn’t turn on very often or consume a ton of power, I know it’s something that will be used consistently for many years. I’ve just been casually browsing the web and I see some that claim to use only 6.5W and some that use up to 100W. That’s a big difference. Over the course of the next however many years, that could turn into a lot of kWh.",waterboysh,/r/homeautomation/comments/fc63q6/i_need_a_new_bathroom_exhaust_fan/,2,homeautomation,3

Don't want to do smart things, or openhab/home assistant type setup.
Don't need control outside the local wifi.
Would like to be able to ask Google Assistant to at least turn it on.
Least I'm thinking is maybe it hosts it's own webserver with a simple interface. Maybe an API that I can integrate with something?

fcbvuj,1583154811,How to get started with open source home automation wifi light switches?,"I want to start making my light switches smart mainly because I don't like it when I'm in bed already half asleep and have to stand up and walk to the other three light switches in my apartment to turn the other lights off. There is one light switch that I can reach from my bed.  

I did look into some products like Philips Hue and thought those are a poor choice mainly because I already have perfectly fine working lamps and the only thing that I think needs to be added is different control. I want to be able to toggle all the 4 lamps in my apartment from that one next to my bed, and also have a way to do it through some LAN software interface. Not something that only works with a mobile app but also with a Linux PC, perhaps a local web server and some bash command. An extra potential thing but not something that I want to spend a lot of money on would be dimmable lights. All the bulbs that I have are LEDs. It would be cool to be able to control that with a software slider and rotary encoder on the wall.

My apartment is small and the routers wifi easily reaches everywhere, and so would the wifi signal from any kind of SBC. I was thinking maybe some open source home automation software running on perhaps a raspberry pi 2 which I have spare, and maybe some ESP32 modules behind the light switches in the walls. I'm not sure on that. Also I should note that the light switches are wired through concrete walls in a rented apartment so I can't rewire through the walls. All I can do is disable the mains power, take off the light switches from the walls, replace them, and perhaps solder something behind the switches. I wonder if it is easy to power the ESP32 modules behind there. Or maybe I'm thinking about this wrong and there is a better approach, let me know! I like to use Free software and open standards.  

It is not important for me yet to get this working from outside my LAN for now. In the past I've set up a VPN on the raspberry pi but that didn't run stable unfortunately. Setting up a VPN will be another future project, and perhaps a mailbox sensor (which is far out of reach of the wifi) as well.",itsjustoneperson,/r/homeautomation/comments/fcbvuj/how_to_get_started_with_open_source_home/,9,homeautomation,9

fcg3vw,1583172320,Personal Setup: Sound Bar won't turn on with TV,"Looking for advice from people smarter than me (most of you in this subreddit). I currently have TCL Smart TV with Roku built in and a Polk Audio Command Bar. The command bar has Alexa built in, and that's what we currently use as our Amazon mic.

My problem is: When using Alexa to turn on the TV, the TCL/roku comes on, but not the polk sound bar.

In a nutshell:

""Alexa turn on the TV"" = TV turns on but sound bar doesn't

*Use TCL/roku Remote* = TV and sound bar turn on

----
When I use the TCL/roku remote to turn on the TV, the sound bar comes on fine. But if I ask Alexa to turn on the TV I have to grab the Polk Command Bar remote and turn it on by hand.

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with this exact set up or can help figure out how to get the sound bar to turn on when the TV is turned on through Alexa.
The audio bar shows up in the Alexa app, but as an input. There's not an option to turn it on or off as a device. I don't have a lot of experience with IFTTT, so I'm wondering if there's an option through that.

It can be used to help you remember where your stuff is. Everything is automatically backed up to the cloud. It also has a few cool home automation applications. Once you have entered in all of your stuff and its location(down to cabinets and shelves), you can tell the Google Assistant to ""Ask HouseBook where my umbrella is"" and it will respond with ""Your umbrella is in the top shelf of the entryway closet."" Or think about when you are making a smoothie and you forgot where the blender is. You can just say ""Hey Google, ask HouseBook where my blender is."" and it will say ""Your blender is in the bottom drawer of the cabinet by the sink."" You can also share your house with others. This can be used for things like....

\- An AirBnb host sharing their house with a tenant. Maybe the tenant needs to know where extra toilet paper is, if the house is going to have pots and pans, how to set up the hot tub etc.

\- Sharing your house with a babysitter coming over so they know where things are.

\- Showing your collection to a friend.

I have a light fixture in my hallway that has been a pain. It's a Gu24 fixture, and I quickly discovered you can't really find gu24 smart bulbs. So, I got a converter that supports regular bulbs and slapped in a Cree smart bulb. It works great so far but I'm a little concerned about one thing, the Cree bulb is thicker than the previous bulb and is pressed up against the top of the fixture. This isn't a light fixture we leave on for long periods of time but the heat of the bulb pressed up against the fixture does have me a little worried.

I am working with a couple of friends to create a smart home network. This network well be very secure and reasonably priced or free. The main reason we intend to build this network is to showcase our technical skills. However, we want to build something many people will find useful, not just something we would have fun making. But to create something that is advantageous to a large number of people is quite a difficult task, so we’re asking you to help us better determine how we can make this network more useful to you by taking a short survey. At the end of the survey, you may leave your email address if you wish to be contacted once a prototype of the network is complete. (Note: This is an anonymous survey. We will not have access to any personally identifiable data unless you choose to disclose your email address.) Thanks in advance!

fcv3ql,1583244686,Un-finished basement lighting options.,"**Here is a little background:**

 I’ve moved into my house about 3 years ago. The basement is completely **un-finished**. It’s pretty much barebone, with the [Basement Concrete Wall Insulation Warp]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxOBhDmnUJ8) from floor to ceiling. We primarily use it as storage but would like to “semi-finish” 3/4s of it soon.

The main problem is lighting and electric. In the whole 1000+spft un-fished basement there are two outlets. One by the breaker box and then one by the sub-pump. There is about 5 “pull string” lights in the basement which are super annoying and there isn’t enough light produced by them.

About a year ago I replaced all the pull sting lightbulbs with smart light bulbs. I keep the pull sting light “on” at all time and use my Echo Plus to control the lightbulbs. I just have them all grouped as “basement lights”.

The previous owner installed a [Lampholder with Pull Chain]( https://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-Porcelain-Lampholder-with-White-Pull-Chain-and-Grounded-Outlet-18305/203716802?mtc=Shopping-B-F_D27L-G-D27L-27_16_INTERIOR_LIGHTING-Generic-NA-Feed-PLA-NA-NA-INTERIOR_LIGHTING_GeneralInteriorLighting&amp;cm_mmc=Shopping-B-F_D27L-G-D27L-27_16_INTERIOR_LIGHTING-Generic-NA-Feed-PLA-NA-NA-INTERIOR_LIGHTING_GeneralInteriorLighting-71700000038836110-58700004241533705-92700048704040313&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAnfjyBRBxEiwA-EECLJXe3SNtIc3TA0ATH5owOek3VKxQADRp4zX8PUQJWvx_OaHvMNbOCRoCv0sQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) at the main landing of the basement stairs that is connected and tied into a 3 way switch with another light fixture half way down the stairs. The Lampholder has an old fluorescent light hooked up to it, so that area is the brightest of all the basement. I’ve replaced the 3-way switch with a “Kasa Smart 3-way”.

fcvkgy,1583246767,iBlinds - Tilt Blinds retrofit (review),"Some of you may remember these guys [https://myiblinds.com/](https://myiblinds.com/) though it's been years since there have been posts about them here. They started as a kickstarter but unlike so many crashed and burned kickstarter dreams (looking at you flipfic!) this one appears to have gone places - they pulled their KS, found an investor, and released a working product you can buy. So I did. Here's the review:

These are for horizontally slatted, tilting blinds (aka Venetian). It works with either the corded type (which are no longer sold in many countries) or the twist-wand type. The device does not raise/lower the blinds themselves, only the tilt.

They are Zwave and work with most major automation systems (I use Hubitat).

The entire mechanism fits inside the top of the blinds, providing a clean look. It's powered by a (proprietary) battery; both direct power (usb) and solar charging options are available. The latter acts as a trickle charger for the battery.

Installation (I did 3 blinds) was fairly simple. The kit comes with several adapters for the most common sizes of internal tilt rods as well as alignment blocks for the motor so that it fits better in larger blinds. You'll want to check the iBlinds website for compatibility instructions/dimensions but they should fit most common types of Venetian blinds.

**Pros &amp; Cons**

**Pros**

* As mentioned installation is straightforward and simple as long as your blinds align with their recommended sizes. Zwave pairing with Hubitat was effortless and the community driver works like a charm (there's an ""official"" Hubitat driver, but a community member improved it).
* The calibration was a little finicky during initial installation but in the end I got them all to open and (fully) close in sync. In general they work well, though it's only been a little over a week so time will have to tell.
* The solar charger is small, out of the way, and does a decent job of trickle charging - though of course as with all things solar this 100% depends on how much light they get - mine get direct sunlight all morning.
* Not specific to iBlinds but I was able to easily integrate them with Homekit using Hubitat + Homebridge, and telling Siri to open my blinds to 30%, etc. hasn't gotten old yet. I also have automation scenes to open and close them in the morning/evening, when light level changes, and so on. I mean, that's why you get these, right?

**Cons**

* Price. With the solar charger they are $149 USD each. True, that is cheaper than replacing your existing blinds with Somfy, et all but still - ouch. There are bulk discounts for buying 2, 3, or more but not much.
* Charging. I suspect most people who are willing to pay that much to automate blinds will put them on windows that get a lot of sun but if your window doesn't and solar charging therefore isn't an option for you then either prepare to charge your battery every few months (iBlinds claims 4 month battery life but of course that depends entirely on how often they are raised/lowered during the day), by hooking up an external USB charger, or go to the trouble of direct-wiring power to your window frames.
* Noise. While I wouldn't call it completely annoying I should mention that these motors are not silent, nor do they emit a low pleasant sort of ""hum"". It's closer to a higher pitch screech. That makes it sound harsher than it is, in reality, but just know whether it bothers you or not you will notice the sound if you are next to these when they activate.
* Fall back (or lack thereof). This is by far my biggest problem with iBlinds. The way they work involves completely replacing the manual tilt mechanism for your blinds (either the cords or twist wand). And the internal tilt rod runs through the motor assembly. This means the *only* way your blinds are now tilting is through iBlinds/your automation system. To make matters worse there isn't even an external button to control the motor manually. If your HA system goes down, or your blinds get disconnected from your ZWave network, they are staying in the position they were in until you fix it. If the battery runs out, you're waiting until it is charged back up. If the iBlinds motor breaks, you're going to need to pull the entire blinds assembly apart and put them back together. And so on.

The last issue is why I can't really recommend these. If for any reason they (or your automation) stops working, so do your blinds. You can't even force them open/closed by manually pulling on the slats because the motor does not move freely when it isn't powered. The only external control is a button that re-calibrates/resets the blinds - even the Zwave pairing button is inside, on the motor.

If they had some way to manually control the blinds then this would just come down to a price/value discussion. Absent that it's hard to recommend these even though they do appear to work and I do like having automated blinds blended in to my smart home routines. I'll be on the lookout for other options.",Planetix,/r/homeautomation/comments/fcvkgy/iblinds_tilt_blinds_retrofit_review/,21,homeautomation,3

I've been searching and searching for an affordable set of home kit compatible switches. I started off with a single [Leviton Decora](https://www.amazon.com/Leviton-DH6HD-1BZ-Decora-Dimmer-HomeKit/dp/B06XKC66HD/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=leviton+homekit&amp;qid=1583298189&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-4) dimmer for $50 a few years ago (and they're still $50) and it's been great but that was too much to replace all the switches i had. I went down the [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) route and bought a broadlink RM blaster ($30) plus some RF outlets (5 for $20) to switch a few things. Overall it was pretty cost-effective and they worked alright but still not the in-wall switches I wanted. Every few months or so i would go on amazon and the rest of the internet and look for deals or new switches but nothing really seemed to come up. 

Until the other day...I stumbled upon [TreatLife smart switches](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R4MFWCQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). This bundle is $60/4 coming out to $15 per switch (non dimmable however the dimmers are about $25). What a deal! The only caveat was that they didn't work out of the box with HomeKit. But, no worries, there's a [homebridge plugin for that](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-tuya-web). 

Even without HomeKit, the SmartLife app (or Tuya App if you want to link with homebridge) is extremely responsive and only time will tell if they will unpair or lose connection. But, I must say, the packaging on these things is quite high quality.

Anyway, the pairing was super easy with the Tuya app and linking to homebridge only required adding your Tuya credentials to the provider and everything else happened automatically. I've so far installed 8 of these switches (6 single pole, 1 single dimmer, and 1 3 way) and they all work great. 

On top of everything else, I just upgraded my 3 year old Pi to run [HOOBS](https://hoobs.org/) and it is quite a luxury

fddcqy,1583330225,Installing a smart dimmer switch in apartment — perhaps a stupid question,"So I have a flush mount led ceiling light &amp; since it doesn’t take any ‘bulbs’, I can’t make it smart by getting anything like the Philips Hue lights. I thought another solution would be to get a smart in-wall dimmer light switch,like the Lutron or something similar. I live in a studio apartment and the light only has one switch. I checked inside of the lamp to get the model number and it DOES have dimming capabilities only with a dimmer switch. I really want to set it up to work with my Amazon Echo. (I love smart home appliances &amp; home automation.) I saw how easy the installation was and read a ton of reviews on how quick it took. My ONLY issue is the first step of installation, the turning off the power before unscrewing the wall plate &amp; disconnecting the wires. I understand that if you touch it, there’s a possibility of getting electrocuted, but I was wondering if it’s possible to install the smart dimmer switch WITHOUT turning off the power from the circuit breaker first. I would be SO careful and obviously not touch anything with my hands. I just live in an apartment and don’t even know where the circuit breaker for the building is, or if I could even access it. Any tips would be great! I’ll attach the link to the switch I want to buy. There’s a short installation video in the amazon link that shows how to do it and what I’m talking about. If there is anyway I could do this, I’m open to any suggestions!

I have everything setup in the same network and works fine while the Smart TV is on.

Anyone here that knows the problem and have a fix for this? :) Would be awesome to get this to work.

This leaves me with the old question of dealing with Smart switches and Smart bulbs working together. Given I already have both installed, I'm thinking of rigging the switch so that the power always stays on, and then using Zwave trigger commands from the switch (via Hubitat) to trigger the Smart bulbs. That way I can have my cake and eat it to - the lights can still be controlled by the switches, but the bulbs won't go out of sync, et all by having the power cut. Only disadvantage I can see is if the switch disconnects or I otherwise have problems with my Zwave network it'll stop working until I fix it but I can live with that.

To do this, all I need to do is connect line and load together on the switch, correct? Or is there something important I am missing?",Planetix,/r/homeautomation/comments/fddzgd/combining_lineload_on_smart_switch/,1,homeautomation,15

I’ve dug around the Tuya app and IFTTT but can’t figure out a way to do this. 

Cheers.

Edit: I figured out how to do the flashing - add multiple on/off actions with a 1s delay in between. This works fine, but it’s not state-aware. I want the light to finish either on or off based on its state prior to the automation.

My question would now be if someone has an idea how i can extend the range. Is there some kind of repeater for the 888.3 mhz / 2.4ghz band? Or can I like open up the controller and modify its internal antennas? 

I don't get how something like this can be designed and sold? It is only for apartments or small houses with thin walls. How can Bosch promote this as a smart home security system, when you can't even provide enough range for the overpriced sensors?

fdvy6d,1583418240,How to automate your weed consumption,"After seeing the meme popup earlier today on this sub I realized that I have a somewhat similar setup at home and figured someone else might be interested in how it was setup. By doing this I will only assume that you live in a place where weed is legal.


I am basing this mini-tutorial on what I have done personally, but it should work with other smart home setups as long as your vape is controllable by a remote and you have some form of IR sender connected to your smart home.

**Here is the setup I am using:**

- [Google Home](https://store.google.com/product/google_home)

- [Arizer Extreme Q vaporizer](https://arizer.com/extreme-q/)

- [Broadlink IR sender](https://www.amazon.com/Broadlink-RM-Mini3-Universal-Controller-Compatible/dp/B01FK2SDOC)

- ihc app



My original plan was just to use a smart outlet connected to the vape and keep it on my preferred temperature, but after trying that I realized that the vape would not automatically turn on after losing power, which led me down this road of figuring out an alternate solution. To be honest, it isn’t an amazing upgrade compared to doing it manually as you still have to pack the bowl with your herbs, but I do find it pretty practical to pack it ready, preheat it and then use the google home to activate the fan and blow up a balloon ready when chilling in the couch. And since a bowl usually lasts a few rounds the next rounds will be pretty much fully automated. And in terms of impressing other herb loving friends, it is pretty high up there in terms of home automation commands. Well worth the effort if you already have an Arizer Extreme Q, not really sure if it's worth the investment just for the automation part.





**Ok, lets get started.**

Assuming you already have your google home setup you need to set up your broad link IR sender. After downloading the app and following the connection instructions I had some small issues connecting it to wifi, but after some troubleshooting I got it connected. 

Then in the ihc app you go to the “universal remote” you just connected and press “Add appliance”. Since this is a pretty custom appliance you will have to scroll all the way down and press “user-defined”. I tried to upload the codes for others to use, but for some reason it does not seem to let me backup the codes in the cloud so you will have to manually add each button. I basically copied most buttons from the remote, but ignored a few of the ones I never use.

[Here is a picture of my button setup](https://imgur.com/ogKdRXr)





At this point you have a working wifi remote for your vape, but since it is a custom appliance it won’t work with google just yet. But luckily it is an easy fix to get it properly set up through “scenes” in the ihc app. Simply go to scenes, press “+” and set up a scene to get it working with google home. Here are some examples of scenes I have set up:

[Vape on](https://imgur.com/LW4ny7p)

[Vape fan 1](https://imgur.com/In5qy05)




The commands will now work with google home as long as you have connected the ihc app through the google home app. To use a command simply say “Hey google, activate XXXXX” where XXXXX is your command. You have to say activate before the command which is a little annoying especially for the little clumsy “Hey google, activate vape off”, but it works pretty well. To get around this you can, however, go into the google home app and set up a routine. Press routines in the app, scroll down to manage routines and press the “+” in the bottom right corner. In the “when I say” field right for example “turn off the vape” and in the “action field” write out the full command; “Hey google, activate vape off”. It should now technically work without saying “activate” first, but to be honest, google is not always playing along with this and I find it easier to just use the activate command as that seems to work more consistently. I also saw another commenter in the meme thread saying he set the arizer up to aromatically shut off the fan after 5 minutes(the time it takes to fill up a bag) and that seemed like a great idea that I will incorporate myself once I get home.

In the ihc app you can also add a custom picture to your appliance, so to finish it off I added this picture of the arizer in the app:

If anyone is gonna break in it's gonna be through that door so I'd like a door sensor. I only want it to notify me when I'm away and I figure the easiest way for that is to have it work with my Nest since the Home/Away on my thermostat works fairly well. So if I could use that to ""arm"" the sensor easily that would be the best, but I know they aren't supporting the ""Works with Nest"" stuff anymore so I'm not even sure if this is possible? I have not switched my Nest account to a Google account yet if that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

I already have a Smartthings hub and some of the samsung water leak sensors which so far have worked alright. Samsung makes a door sensor that is only about $17 but it's pretty bulky and I'm not sure if it works with the Nest Home/Away.

I saw this thing:  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWMTUI8/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWMTUI8/)  which the size seems perfect but it has mixed reviews and again I don't know how easy it is to integrate to notify me only when I'm away. It's also $50 so I'd only want to spend that if I knew it was gonna work for sure.

I also have Phillips Hue bulbs but the home/away stuff has in my limited experience not worked very well and I'm not even sure if it works with multiple phones.

&amp;#x200B;

So can anyone recommend a door sensor to achieve what I'm looking for?

If anyone can answer this, it's this community.

Need a setup for this scenario:

Kid (12 - special needs) wakes up, goes to the kitchen counter, presses a button on the recording device (or a voice command), and records himself taking his daily medication. \~15 - 30 seconds, max. Upon completion, notification or email sent to multiple emails/devices (parents, grandparents, etc), where we can view the video.

The point: if he doesn't take these meds, it will be a really bad day at school, potentially ending with him in a psychiatric facility. If none of the parents/grandparents get the notification by a certain time, we'll all know to call the school nurse.

If we can get this working, my wife can return to work, and we'll be able to dig out of debt.

Limitations:

I currently have no home automation/surveillence in place, no alexa, no smart devices other than phones. Kid doesn't have a phone, and I can't leave a 'portable' device on the kitchen counter for him, because he can't be trusted with it yet.

Things I currently have:

\- 1 indoor Arlo camera, unplugged for the past year.

\- 1 4-node pi cluster (k8s), used for pihole, plex, NAS, vpn, etc. with intention to incorporate more home surveillence/automation.

\- 9 empty ports on a 16 port switch

\- Room to run patch if necessary

\- Amazon fire hd 8 tablet, with kid mode/free time setup. Old amazon fire tablet (5?), still functional.

Hesitations:

Currently have no alexa or smart devices, mainly due to security concerns. Am willing to try, and my wife is pestering for alexa.

Does anyone have any experience with incorporating the IOT and smart home devices into the training and general surveillance of their dog?  I know a lot of people have video monitors nowadays but does anyone utilize additional devices?

I'm looking to get a puppy (preferably but I may also adopt an older dog) and would like to use smart home devices so the dog can manage with me gone during the work day.  To accomplish this I have the following pursuits for my smart home.  These include:
1.  Remote video monitoring with voice projection
2.  Automatic food dispenser to dispense food on a specified schedule
3.  RFID enabled locks on a doggie door so the dog can let itself as it pleases while we can also maintain a secure physical security of the house
4.  Efence/ invisible fence to detain the dog within a specified boundary that is close enough for the wifi signal.  This way I can maintain view of the dog as well as give it commands even when it's outside.
5.  This one is less essential but I'm considering have a machine which will throw a ball when the dog returns it... Not sure what this thing is called but they have a lot of them on Amazon. 

What are your thoughts Reddit?  Good idea or Bad idea?  Obviously, I'd like to spend more time with the dog that I get but work is not always conducive to raising a dog.

In my current appartment I'm using Hue bulbs and other Home Automation solutions controlled by Homeassistant. I'm moving to a house where we'll do redo all electrical, the switches, etc.

As my new house will have 4 times the square meters I currently have, I want to go for a more cost-efficient solution than using Hue Bulbs for my lighting in the entire house.

I'm familiar with Zigbee and Z-Wave, which would be my go-to solution. However my architect (not sure how much experience with homeautomation he has) recommends to hard-wire all the switches, controlled from the basement (since we're redoing all electrical anyway).

I'm curious what you would recommend: I understand hard-wiring the switches from a central switchboard used to be the go-to solution for Home Automation, but with all the innovation in wireless protocols I'm not sure whether this is still the case. What would you recommend? Any idea which solution is more cost-efficient (considering they'll redo all switches and electrical anyway).

I was wondering if I could use a simple 12v ZWave relay instead of the button as a way of automating it.

Does a product like this exist? I can find plenty of in wall smart switches, but nothing for desktop usage. Hoping to potentially even mount under the desk.

I am not sure of all the correct terminology but I would say that I don't have a true hub but I have Alexa acting as the hub right now, as all my devices are accessible through it and it is where I setup all my automation.

I have Ring Alarm and Ring Cameras, Nest Thermostat as well a Z-wave switches and it works well enough, but I feel like a lot of what I have put together is clunky, limited, and not fully automated and I am wondering if I am missing out on more advanced functionality due to not having a ""real"" hub.

Hoping someone could let me know what hub (or something else) can be added to my setup in order to do thing like the below.

Here are some example rules that I am unable to get working because they conflict or are nested:

- When the sun sets turn on the lights until a set time
- When the Alarm is armed and the sun is down turn on the exterior lights for 5 mins when ring camera detects motion,
- If the temperature in the basement is 10 degrees less than the main floor, turn on the fan
- when Alarm has the status disarmed turn off motion alerts
- When front door opens turn off recording for 30 seconds

From my understanding each device has X things you can control. If there is a first party app you usually get access to those X things directly, but with limited or no logic. If I try to use a third party to control that device, like Alexa, I will get access to more logic but less than X control options (for example no fan control of Nest on Alexa, no slow fade control of z-wave switch on Alexa).

To sum up what, if anything, can I add to my system to ensure I get access to all the options each of my devices has and start to be able to use IF, WHILE, OR, AND, etc logic to them?",2daMooon,/r/homeautomation/comments/ffzs0a/hubless_smarthome_am_i_missing_advanced/,2,homeautomation,15

I, a former Sergeant of Marines, was duped this weekend by an extremely pushy and manipulative Vivant salesman.

I turned and thought to myself ""Ill let him do his spiel and tell him no"" . Its not even clear to me how but my wife nearby heard the conversation and got pulled into the conversation. I didnt want to come across as rude to my wife in front of a third party but I knew the minute she invited him in, it was done.

He was very convincing, manipulative, and pushy. It wasnt until signing that he mentioned I would be financing the equipment for 60 months. No mention of Vivint's rights to increase the price to monitor after the 60 month term. He told me installation would happen the next day, Sunday (3/8) at 1PM. 1PM came and went, and I called the salesman at 1:40 and he told me they ""ran out of inventory"" and that installation would have to be another day. It wasnt obvious but what a red flag. i was livid though because I had rearranged my whole schedule for this. He called 30 mins later and said a tech would be out that same day at 4PM. Installation went as planned.

After reading reviews on BBB, Consumer Reports and the Reddit community, I felt sick to my stomach. I called customer service and they gave me the whole rundown about how they could lower my payments and I told them ""I dont care what you say, this does not align to my financial goals and was susceptible to a convincing and manipulative salesman.

fg8ogp,1583816602,I used a two-way Tuya/Smart Life switch to independently control groups of smart bulbs on a single circuit and wanted to share.,"I've been on an automation kick lately with lighting and wanted to do something cool for my son so I picked up this [light fixture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CV6WQLZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and a set of 4 these [RGB smart bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W4C33BT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). Right now I'm sticking with bulbs/switches that are Tuya/Smart Life compatible because they're cheap and I can reflash some of them OTA if I want to go that route. I have 3 UAP-AC-Pros so having a few dozen 2G devices spread across the house isn't an issue.

Immediately after hanging it we realized it wasn't enough light, the color temperature was way too cool, and it *kind of* looked like a swastika. It was clear it wasn't going to work so I returned the fixture and instead bought this [eight-armed tentacle spider lamp thingy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077D5YV6C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and a package of [hanging paper lanterns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XT7NPYY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to go with it. I also bought a pair of [2700k smart bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082X4QTKJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and a couple more of the RGB smart bulbs for a total of six RGB bulbs and two 2700k bulbs.

Once it was all installed it was awesome. The two 2700k bulbs provided plenty of light for his room and the six RGB bulbs made for a very cool scene. We grouped the white bulbs in a group and the RGB bulbs in a group so he could use the Smart Life app and made some groups in Alexa to do the same through his Echo. On the surface, it was great.

The problem is he was trained to use his light switch and constantly disconnecting and reconnecting 8 devices simultaneously and then having to wait to dim or control them was less than ideal. But how to control them the way he wanted?

Then I saw this [two-way smart switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BTBZ69B/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and figured you know, I can probably just bypass the switch and keep all the smart lights powered all the time and use this switch to control each group by setting up automations in the app. I ordered it to find out and installed it today, and it works great.

I wired the light fixture to always have power and I wired power to the switch, but left the loads disconnected. After pairing I created two automations for each of the two buttons: One set to turn on and off the white lights with the top button, and one set to turn on and off the colored lights with the bottom button.

I figured I'd share because it may not be an obvious solution. I also found this [three-way single-gang](https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Control-Required-Provides-Anywhere/dp/B07Q5XPRKD/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=smart+life+three+way&amp;qid=1583816364&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-9) switch that you could use in the same manner.

fgb6zh,1583832822,"Help with LED strips, controllers and Power Supply","Hi!

So I will start with my hardware.

 

Wifi RGBW controller

* Working Voltage: DC12-24V
* Output channel: 4 channel
* Output current: 4A\*4 (I have no idea what the \*4 means, could someone explain?)
* Connect method: Common anode
* Distance: 30m MAX
* Software: Android system(at least 2.3 version with WiFi function) or IOS system.
* Max supported by 10m led strip.

RGBW led strip

* 5050 60led/m
* 14.4W/m
* 12V voltage
* IP20 protection

&amp;#x200B;

So I calculated and for this LED strip I would need at least 80W 12V 6.5A Power supply. I asked the guy in the store if it's okay to use this Power supply with my controller and he said yes (""the controller will draw how much it needs no worries of it burning out""). I am a little sceptical about that.

So my questions are:

1. Is it okay to connect that power supply to my controller without it burning out or do I need a stronger controller or a weaker LED strip?
2.  If I cut the strip in half can I use a weaker Power supply like a 42W 12V 3,5A?
3. If I cut the strip in half and put a 2 meter AWG wire between them (without led, to use as an extension so I don't need to buy multiple LED controller) does the power supply stay the same or do I need a stronger one because of the length (2.5+2+2.5=7m)?

  I have an old holding tank alarm that Id like to receive notifications if the circuit is closed, ideally WiFi connected.  Ive done some searching but not really sure what I need to get this done.  

The transformer has 110v coming in and sends 12v out to the float switch.  Once the float switch completes the circuit AND the switch is set to Horn, then an audible alarm (powered by the 12v from the transformer**)** will be sounded to notify us that the level is high.

What would the easiest way to receive notifications from this be?  Bonus if I could remotely control the audible alarm cause it almost always goes off in the middle of the night.

I have two main questions and a small side one:

If I buy a 10m rgb led strip is there any way I can plug it into an outlet or a plug that would enable it to be controlled through homekit/not with the remote those get delivered with, or do I have to invest in rgb Strips that already have that function (or would it even be cheaper because of cost of modification?) 
And do y'all have any specific recommendations for homekit friendly rgb Strips (available in Europe/Germany)?

The second question is if there's any other gu10 bulbs out there except for the Phillips hue ones that work well (or is it better to just bite the bullet on the price and go fully Hue) Sadly the Ikea ones only come in white and I'd like colours if at all possible...


Tiny side question: automating fairy lights in a canopy (mains powered), is that a reasonable idea or am.i better off just going with an old fashioned preprogrammed timer-plug?

I have 8 total C by GE bulbs in my home spread across 3 rooms, 3 in the bedroom, 1 in an office, and 4 in the living room. I also have 4 Sengled bulbs in the bedroom and a LIFX and Yeelight bulb in the office. The office and bedroom each have a Google Home Mini while the living room has a Lenovo Smart Clock.

Recently, I've been noticing that random C by GE bulbs do not respond to voice commands to turn on/off or when activated through the Google Home app. The other bulbs all work fine. It's as if they are not able to connect to the WiFi, but they always come back and are addressable again if given a few hours.

I have tried resetting and reconnecting all of the bulbs as well as removing the C by GE service from the Home app and then adding it back (which also required all of the bulbs to be set up again).  I have also used the voice command for ""sync my devices"" which didn't seem to have any impact.

I'm moving to a new house next month, built in 2019. My plan is to start automating things step by step. I don't have any experience with home automation but after reading the wiki, I somehow understood what all the z-wave/zigbee standards are for. My main focus here is having full control of everything, without any smart device connecting to the outside or a 3rd party so I'm very interested in HomeAssistant, even tho I never used it before. Is HASS in this case considered a ""hub"", similar to a z-wave hub for instance?

I'm having some confusion in choosing a standard (e.g. z-wave) or just buying wifi/802.11 devices that are controlled by HASS. What is recommended in this case? should I go with a standard? if so, which one?

Is there a need for going with a standard rather than sticking with HASS and wifi IOT devices?

* truly disable network bridging to guarantee that no internet ""trickles"" over from the WIFI connection to the Ethernet (everything I can find online is about enabling network bridging, not stamping it closed and firewalling it)
* guarantee that Home Assistant will never have access to the WIFI?

I just don't want to deal with random updates or security risks on my Home Assistant side, since they'll actually be connected to physical devices in my home. I'm also envisioning a future where I am able to refresh current weather/time data on the PC, and pass that information (via a CSV file or something) to Home Assistant running on the same PC.

I have google assistant speakers in every room and corner of my house. Enjoy listening to music in the entire flat and I use a few routines on a daily basis. 

I have a harmony hub connected to a Sony TV, ps4 with a IR receiver, and a TV box and that setup works flawlessly. 

Harmony and google are connected to a Smarttings hub. That gave me the ability to have various buttons and switches, program my harmony remote to switch on and off various lamps, a fan and another TV. 

I have my google routines “filtered” by smartthings virtual switches so certain actions only take place on certain time of day. The same goes for my roomba which runs when I leave but only once a day. 

I can ask google what’s the temperature in the house and the water in my iKettle, or if the main door is open and such. 

I am the master of the light in my house, it works exactly the way I want or it runs on it’s own. There is about 20 bulbs and switches on 60m2. 

Things that I can’t or won’t do are thermostat, air purifier and door lock. I can explain if anyone cares. 

Also, I have a ikea tradfri hub that operates my blinds. 

I obviously have countless automations and smart apps and all the big services connected and a few Ifttt applets running.

Details: purchasing a 2 story house with a walk-out basement (paired to a garage) that was recently completed renovated (edit: the house was renovated, not just the basement). They really did a bang-up job with this place. But from what I've seen, the closest they've come to home automation is 2 Ecobee thermostats (1 on each floor), which look amazing.

What I'm looking to do: probably keep the smart thermostats.

Also going to add security monitoring.

Already own: WiFi roomba, WiFi enabled washer/dryer.

I would like to be able to control all of this using voice and via a phone app, and hoping a lot of this stuff can be automated (lights on/off at certain times, auto-garage door opener, etc).

I need some help, I've just invested some money into a Bosch smart home system to try it. I've got a couple smart thermostats and a smart plug.

I really like these devices but one feature I really miss is any historical data. For example I would love to be able to see the usage of power over a day, but I haven't been able to find a way to do this it seems to only show the current usage.

The two switches on the left are both single-pole smart dimmers C by GE. They each control a zone of 3 lights in the kitchen (see second photo). The switch on the lower right corner of the photo is the 3-way paddle smart switch (controls a zone of 6 lights in the kitchen). Ignore the paddle switch in the upper right hand corner - that’s a “dumb” switch we are leaving alone which controls some sink lamps.

Thoughts on brands and approach here?  For example, if I buy Ring brand cameras do I need to then add their Ring hub? What about Nest cameras? Ideally I'd like something compatible with my current setup and not add yet another hub of some sort.",talfiolixy,/r/smarthome/comments/fisjy3/adding_security_cameras/,3,smarthome,5
fisldp,1584232033,Question on new construction and alarm.com,"Thanks in advance for any help!  We are doing new construction and I am trying to plan for home automation, I have a couple of questions that are hard to test before without the system.  For a number of reasons I am basically obligated to use [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) for the first 3 years (or at least pay for it).  From what they have told me they are using the Qolsys IQPRO if that matters for this.

1.) I don't think [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) is going to ultimately have all of the home automation features I want, but it will probably be enough for the short term.   It appears I can add the panel as a secondary panel to some of the other hubs and manage some of the devices, can anyone confirm how well this works?  Do I have to have installer rights on the [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) panel?  The current alarm company doesn't seem super in to DIY but I could ask.

2.) I am looking at the Leviton zwave (DZ6HD) switches since they seem to be the nicest of supported ones (I thought the Eaton ones were a bit large looking).  It seems like most zwave switches would work, but they art not ""guaranteed"" so is it super important?  Anyone have other suggestions on alternatives?

2a.) The [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) automation seems to only support a limited ""maximum"" number of zwave devices (30-40 they stated) so maybe I am going to be moving to a 2nd controller quickly anyway?   I don't want to make decisions based on [alarm.com](https://alarm.com)'s limited ecosystem if I likely going to have to add a 2nd controller anyway.

3.) We have a Lennox HVAC system and they are planning the iComfort S30 for the thermostats.  I don't see this on the [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) supported devices.  How important will this integration be?  Obviously lots of reasons to have a thermostat integrated, but it doesnt appear to be zwave so I am thinking I cannot even access it from [alarm.com](https://alarm.com)?  Should I switch to a zwave thermostat?

fiu87t,1584238984,Is this door going to be a pain for a Schlage Encode lock?,"I initially deleted this post because I answered my own question, but /u/illgainedgoods made a good point about leaving it in case people have the same question. This was a pretty basic question about installing a smart lock. I am not bad at following instructions/YouTube videos, but I haven't really done much home reno before (this is my first owned property and it's a condo). I'm discovering that a lot of things are pretty easy to figure out if you just disassemble them and take a look at the problem before getting overwhelmed.

**The question:** I had ordered a Schlage Encode lock without paying much mind to my current deadbolt, but I took a look last night and realized the handle/deadbolt are [installed with a mechanism together](https://imgur.com/a/eoFNbyV) so that the handle can open the deadbolt from the inside if it's locked. Is this going to be too much of a pain? Will I have to just create a new deadbolt fitting higher in the door/doorframe and fill in the old one?

**UPDATE:** I took an extra 10 minutes after I asked the question and removed the entire mechanism. The result is that **1.)** The original deadbolt hole appears to be plenty high enough to allow room for the inside-facing side of the Schlage Encode, **2.)** The metal covering originally installed dug into the paint in the door, so I'll just have to clean/repaint that area so it doesn't look like garbage, and **3.)** The door handle looks silly without a covering, but it isn't my top priority, and once the Encode hardware is installed, I can just go to Home Depot and find a door handle cover that is small enough to fit.",TheWineOfTheAndes,/r/homeautomation/comments/fiu87t/is_this_door_going_to_be_a_pain_for_a_schlage/,2,homeautomation,2

Temporary buyer's remorse. I'm going through something similar with Caseta.

It's a 1250 sq. ft. modern home and I don't ever see myself going over the 50 device limit (supposedly 75 now) but in any case that would be as simple as switching over to the pro bridge instead of the regular caseta bridge. 

So if you were in my shoes what would you have done? Zwave-based or is Lutron really the best, most solid option available like a lot of people seem to believe?

Also I run homeassistant as a master controller for all my devices so compatability between technologies is fine because I can just have hass handle everything.

fj9k3b,1584310246,Can I use an Inovelli smart dimmer switch for a non-dimmable load?,"Is there some way I can configure an Inovelli smart dimmer switch (red series) to act as a standard on/off switch? It would be simpler to not have to get both dimmers and regular switches, the regular switches require a neutral while the dimmers do not, and also the red series dimmers (unboxed) are actually cheaper than the switches.

Ideas I can think of:

* Set the minimum brightness to 100% (or something close to it). The problem with this plan is that the minimum dim level parameter only goes up to 45%
* Set dimming speed and ramp rate to 0, and \[somehow?\] reconfigure the long-press up and down actions to do something different than changing the brightness level.
* Ask /u/InovelliUSA for a firmware update to support this

Semi-related: What kind of dimming technology do the dimmer switches use? I used to work in theatrical stage lighting, where the dimmers had the option to switch themselves into a ""non-dim"" mode where they would only control on and off. We would do this if we needed to control a motor, for example, since there was some theoretical risk of damage or unexpected behavior if we fed the chopped sine wave output of an SCR dimmer to a motor or other type of load that can't handle it.

For my purposes, I'd be interested in whatever degree of support for this is possible, whether it supports loads that don't react well to slight dimming or not.",squigish,/r/homeautomation/comments/fj9k3b/can_i_use_an_inovelli_smart_dimmer_switch_for_a/,1,homeautomation,4

fjgn4g,1584341246,Controling infrared devices from PC (and other way around),"So I'm currently getting into home automation and all the smart home stuff, and a thing that I realized quickly, was that I have way too many devices in my room, that are being controlled by a remote control (aka infrared). We're talking TV's, LED strips, Thermostats etc...

Now my ultimate goal would be to control all of these devices from my PC with a click of a mouse button - that turned out to be way way harder than I thought. My journey so far looked like this - I thought about hooking up an infrared transmitter/reciever up to my PC, writing some code that reads and stores the IR signal from my remote control, writing some more code that blasts the same IR signal from the transmitter and BOOM. Goal achieved. Me being way too dumb and hasty just went on amazon, bought the first IR Transmitter/Reciever that I found, hooked it up to the PC only to find out that the USB is only for the electricity and there's no actual information going to the blaster or coming from the reciever. It was a mere extender. Why is that important? Because in the last 5 hours of googling and searching on amazon I was not able to find a single IR transmitter that isn't:

a) Only an extender that can't be programmed in any way

b) A transmitter for phone that works only with some specific app

c) A transmitter for Arduino/Raspberry and not DIRECTLY for PC

So I considered other options - a smart watch that has infrared? Turns out that's a rare thing as well. Controling infrared devices with Alexa? I don't have Alexa and wouldn't be willing to set it up **just** to control some LED strips or a TV. Going with a raspberry? That sounds like the most logical 2nd option but that brings me to the point why I'm here - how do you/would you deal with a bunch of IR devices? Maybe I'm just bad at searching and a programmable IR USB transmitter/reciever is out there on Amazon? Maybe there's an even fancier solution that I haven't considered yet? Do you have any suggestions?

EDIT: What I totally forgot to add, was that since the remote control wouldn't be used after sucessfully setting up some form of PC - IR Device connection, I was thinking about using the remote control to control the PC. Under the assumption that I have both - a reciever AND a transmitter hooked up to the PC, I could totally set up the PC to react to the remote control... IF... If I found a working prgrammable transmitter/reciever...

fjiiei,1584352523,Best way to deal with Velux,"Hi there!

I want to put something smart in my home, but the thing I need the most is controlling 2 velux windows and their shades automatically (In summer this could help a lot with the temperature).

From what I understand one option is to buy the velux kit built in collaboration with netatmo. But I've been told, by netatmo support, that the sensors of this solution do not integrate with other netatmo sensors (wtf?) and I'm not sure how well I can create my own routines. I don't need to control air quality (I've got automatic ventilation) as much as I need to control temperature (e.g.: closing shades automatically in summer at a certain hour, open everything when it's hotter inside than outside). And, also from what the support told me, all the data from the sensors cannot be used to control other appliances (e.g.: I've got a CO2 and temperature sensor but I cannot use the data to control the heating and the ventilation but I should buy another netatmo sensor? seriously?)

The other option, if I got it correctly, would be to buy my own smart thermostate/air quality sensor and... to get something that transmits using the io-homecontrol protocol, that apparently should always work with velux products, even if it's not a velux controller. Is this right? I've tried googling a lot ""io-homecontrol"" but I can't see ""general purpose"" controllers for sale. Am I getting everything right?

fjk7uz,1584361959,[NEW TO HA] Lutron Caseta Light Switches .... starting out,"Hello everyone! So I am getting more and more into Home Automation, and would like to slowly build a HomeKit ecosystem. Currently I have 3 Door locks, a Smart Plug, and a thermostat being controlled by Homekit. Next up is a slow transition for Light Switches (I'm so tired of hollering at the kids to turn the lights off!).

With that said, I am strongly considering the Lutron Caseta line of products for it's reputable integration with Homekit. I know I'll need to get a kit first to include their bridge, but after that, I should be good (unless I go over 50 switches, which wouldn't be for a while, those things aren't cheap!), correct?

Thanks for any insight you may have. And if you're running these switches in your home, would you mind sharing some pictures of how they look on the wall? I have some wall plates with 3 light switches, do 3 of these even fit side by side in this case?

fkcii5,1584477133,Tado vs Netatmo - comparison of both systems,"Hi, as I've been googling in the past looking for direct comparison between Tado and Netatmo and finding nothing (no personal experience with both), I've decided to share my experience with both systems as I've recently switched from Netatmo to Tado. Hopefully someone will find it usefull :)

My setup:

* 3 radiator valves
* 1 underfloor heating radiator with thermostat (controlled in same way as a boiler, so no difference in connecting thermostat to boiler or to the convector)

***Hardware:***

* Netatmo eink display is cool - it shows you temperature all the time, no need to touch the button
* With Netatmo, you do not have to think about right valve to buy, display orients itself depending on its horizontal/vertical position. But in my case, manual control would be needed, as ""vertical"" display would be better for my horizontal setup (based on position of valves in the room)
* Tado valves are MUCH quieter than Netatmo. Netatmo could wake you in bedroom, Tado is very silent (but still noticeable)
* Tado valves are easier to control - fully rotating button is more effective than tipping one point to left or right
* Battery replacement is much easier for me with Tado for both thermostat and valves. For valves, I do not have enough space between wall and valve to pull out batteries from Netatmo. With Tado, you easily unsnap whole valve, replace batteries and snap it back in. Netatmo I'd have to unscrew whole valve (not easy). Thermostat is basically the same - removing Tado from wall to replace batteries is a snap. With netatmo, it's holding really tight on 4 latches, which are pretty small and I think cannot last very long
* Tado thermostat is big. It's much bigger than regular wall switch, so installing it in tight place (my case) might be difficult. Netatmo is regular size but the holes in baseplate are not compatible with european (round) wall installation hole
* Tado has much better range. With Netatmo I had to find suitable socket so all valves were in range. With Tado I put bridge in closet in wall rack (so it's closed, brick on one side, metal door on the other) and everything is working very well. Also valves and thermostat react much quicker to the commands (within second, netatmo took sometimes even half a minute)
* Tado has integrated humidity sensors - really nice touch!
* Bridge for Tado is smaller but has only ethernet connectivity. Netatmo, while bulkier offers wifi connectivity as well which can be plus for someone.

**Winner**: display is only real benefit for Netatmo, so Tado all the way.

***Software and installation:***

* Netatmo installation is a snap. It's damn easy to follow app instructions and install everything in a breeze.
* Tado app gave me headaches... while it's not hard, there are issues in the app - connection takes about a minute or two by which time my phone display turns off. And when it turns off, you have to start again. Also ""next"" button was sometimes grayed out... had tu go one page back and forward.
* Thermostat instalation is also more complicated for Tado, requiring computer, not phone... not sure why.
* While both systems offer similar functionality, Netatmo app is nicer, more intuitive for me.
* Most important thing - defining schedules is much better with Netatmo - by simply asking you few questions, you are good to go. With Tado, you have to do it manually. And even the manual setups are better done by netatmo - you have different types of schedules (comfort, away,...) which you simply assign. You can copy schedule from one day to another. Everything is just a breeze.
* But as you'll do setup just once and maybe adjust it a bit, i do not find it really important.
* Some automation functions in Tado are paid for - open window detection, geofencing (netatmo does not have this, which is a shame, though it has been promised for years). It's €3/month which is not much, fur system that cost hundreds it should be included. Especially as app gives you notifications to do it manually if you are not paying customer.

**Winner**: Netatmo

***Heat controll:***

* Probably most crucial part... as for now, I think both systems run comparably.
* Only ""issue"" i have is with Tado thermostat - even though it receives the signal to turn up the heat, it sends control signal to floor convector with ""big"" delay - like a minute or so. I'll be contacting Tado support if this is normal.

***Others:***

* My system is specific that I do not have a boiler. This has been big issue with netatmo as I later found out - basically, if thermostat and valves are connected to same relay, system expects, that thermostat is connected to boiler and doesn't allow heating of rooms with valves if the boiler is not ""turned on"". So either you are stuck at heating other rooms only if the room with thermostat is heated or room with thermostat is heated all the time any of the valves is active. Not good. I have discussed it with support and was told there is no way around it except for getting another separate relay for valves only. Great. Later I got second hand relay for a few euros and other issues began - relays are somehow hard wired to the valves/thermostat they come with. By some magic and fiddling I was finally able to pair my existing valves to this new relay and everything was working as expected.
* With Tado I asked support first, if 2 relays will be needed or not. First answer was it will be same as netatmo, but they'll ask engineers. I got answer half a day later that they will be able to adjust it to my needs! Great. In the end, I did not had to contact them at all and everything was working on the first try. This was for now only contact to support and it was a breeze!
* Support has been pain in the ass with Netatmo since begining. Right after buying, one valve was no closing, resolution took 2 weeks with support (replying in 2-3 days at best). Same goes for when one valve stopped working all together few days after installing new relay - 1 week without response, after that telling me ""they have customers whos systems are not working at all so they have bigger priority in the winter"". Also, I think only 1 guy runs whole support as each time I was only speaking to him.
* With Netatmo I've encountered issue with valves not closing quite a few times - running recalibration multiple times was sometimes necessary. Quite big issue when you wake up and room is at 27 degrees because radiator has been running all night... and valve thought it is closed.
* Both systems limit max temperature. For Netatmo, it's 30°, for Tado it's just 25°. I honestly do not feel there is need for more than 25, but for some people this might be limiting. Workaround for Tado is offsetting measured temperature.

Simply put, due to issues with another relay needed and support basically not working for such an important product as heating is (if I did not keep original valves, I'd have to control heating by the bottom t-screw all the time) and the hardware issues I asked for refund with netatmo who first accepted it and another week later declined it. Fortunately I bought it using Paypal and was given full refund. I installed Tado replacement this week and for now it seems to be running like a breeze!

Also, I do not think Netatmo development is heading anywhere, there is no roadmap for requested features, support forum is basically dead, etc... and if only 1 guy is in support, who knows how many developers there are. Also, French. :D

Tado, has been adding features, has units for controlling cooling systems, thermostat supports more systems (even regular underfloor heating), etc. As for me, I think it's a better buy.

Feel free to ask questions :)

fkd4ae,1584479236,"Ikea Tradfri, Sonos, and LightwaveRF Integration","Hi all,

I’ve been a Sonos user since they were quite new and have various speakers around the house including a bridge to bring them together.  I few updates ago I was able to remove that bridge and connect a unit direct to the router.  I have also owned a nest thermostat for a few years (V1 unit) and a pair of the smoke alarms so that’s another hub for this technology. Recently I also bought the Ikea Tradfri bulbs/gateway/switch set and have a couple of lamps which now come on together.  I’ve added it to Apple HomeKit so can control it by voice but having got the bug I now want more but I’m out of router connections.

I have under unit kitchen lighting that’s controlled by a switch and not meaningfully dimmable as well as other lighting that uses bulbs which can’t be switched out for tradfri.  I’m therefore looking at the LightwaveRF Switches and power outlets to fully upgrade the experience.

I have a few questions that I’d like some help with;

LightwaveRF is premium priced.  Is there an alternative that works on UK wiring that I’ve not spotted in the market, I’d be grateful to know.

Can I drop the tradfri hub and use the LightwaveRF (or suggested alternative) hub to connect all of them? Is there perhaps a third hub that might do this for me?

I’m attracted to the switches as an upgrade because they are intuitive to anyone.  I can add automation for my own purposes but they won’t be broken by someone just using them which might happen to smart bulbs.  I’m assuming that the Sonos will just continue to integrate into HomeKit as it does now too but mentioned it in case there are different ways to approach this that may or may not be compatible.",Buttoneer138,/r/smarthome/comments/fkd4ae/ikea_tradfri_sonos_and_lightwaverf_integration/,10,smarthome,6

With  so many smart home products on the market now I am completely  overwhelmed with what we should go with. We don't need anything too  fancy, but I love toys so I am interested in what's out there. I want to  control lights as well as our heater and AC but I am unsure if the last  two can be connected to a smart home system. I am hoping to run  everything off of a RPi since they don't consume much power and can be  left on 24/7.

I recently came across this heater (Happybuy 5KW Diesel Air Heater)  which I think we will be using but I am unsure if we can hook it up to a  Nest (or similar) and have it function properly to control temperature.  We are also using this AC (MRCOOL Comfort Made Simple DIY 12,000 BTU Ductless Mini Split)  and although it has a smart controller and it's own app, I really want  to be able to have it interface with the thermostat and main smart home  stuff. I love a nice user interface. We plan to have a permanently  mounted iPad Mini.

If anyone can  help up design an awesome system we can certainly donate to your beer  fund. We will also be making a blog post about it all on out site sasquatters dot com and you will surely be mentioned.

fkghm9,1584491895,"Getting frustrated. Is Google messing up my automation goals? I now have: Google doorbell, cam, speaker, and mini; Lutron Caseta switches; Samsung smart things hub + smart detector; Hubitat hub; Harmony; &amp; Brilliant light switches.","Getting a little frustrated here.  I think this might be a rant.  

&amp;#x200B;

In fairness: with some of the stalling going on below, we have had a pretty hard year for a lot of reasons and this hasn't been at the forefront of our priority list.  

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, all I've accomplished at this point is that I've been able to use my voice or the Google Assistant to turn Lutron and Brilliant lights on or off, and - in a limited manner - to get some motion detecting abilities to operate some lights.  

&amp;#x200B;

My husband wanted to get Google products because he reasoned they'd be around forever, etc, etc.  I wasn't really involved at that stage.   I didn't know that Google didn't really have a hub that ran automations based on triggers beyond voice-activated stuff.  Triggers are one of the main things that make a smart home smart!

&amp;#x200B;

The Casetas are cool.  Except that I wanted to make it so the exterior light turns on at dusk when motion is detected, but then Stringify got killed, and the Nest doorbell can't be used as a trigger for motion anyway, so dammit.  

&amp;#x200B;

I loved the idea of Brilliant switches.  Their ad said, ""all together now;"" in the ad, the doorbell rings and I can see who is there right away!  Except no, because Nest doorbell is Google, and Google still hasn't let Brilliant in, you can't see who is at the door without opening the Nest app and waiting for it to load while someone waits at the door.  We really don't use the Brilliant intercom as much as you might think.  It is nice, though, to see the time and date in any room and to have Alexa in the kitchen for ordering things when you need them and to display weather.  

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I basically only use two functions on the Google Assistant app (pull up my shopping list and turn off all the lights), every time I open the app, it tells me traffic for a commute I don't have, the weather, stuff on my calendar.  I have a calendar and traffic and weather apps.  I just want two damn buttons that do the two things i want it to do again and again; instead I have to type or speak them every time.  Google also just talks too damn much.  ""Ok, turning off x lights.  By the way, x lights are disconnected..."" I know, dammit, I'll get to that later, you don't need to tell me every day...

&amp;#x200B;

I like that the Nest doorbell announces doorbell rings to the Google devices and sometimes recognizes people.  It is annoying, though, how hard it is to just shuffle a Spotify playlist to a speaker group.  Also, half the time it doesn't recognize my voice when I try to add things to the shopping list.

&amp;#x200B;

We bought a Nest thermostat.  I've hooked up several in the past, but I found out that I have an upscale, ""special"" HVAC system that will require special rewiring to hook it up (it is a communicating thermostat; the company (Carrier) has their own, poorly-rated smart thermostat).  I don't even know where that Nest thermostat is right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The Harmony was supposed to help with the Yale smart locks, but then I got zigbee instead of z-wave or vice versa; can't remember.  Anyway, the Yale app sucks.  They locks are installed, and have just been sitting there as a nice way to get into the house with a code, but not being automated in any way or allowing remote codes.  I also wanted to use Harmony to control a TV, potentially a fireplace, and some candles I haven't set up yet; but the basement (where the fireplace/TV was supposed to go) flooded a few months back, so that whole project got sidelined...

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit that I opened the Hubitat package, logged on, didn't know what a dashboard even was, tried to get my Lutron and Google devices on there, got frustrated, and walked away for a few months.  Apparently I also have the wrong Lutron hub for Hubitat, so yeah.

[Smart Door Demo](https://reddit.com/link/fkr601/video/zoi9htcz5gn41/player)

I'm a little forgetful. Leaving the door unlocked happened from me from time to time. I work far, therefore, coming back home isn't always possible so I made my door a bit smarter. This will work with most of locks, my modification is invisible to the eye and set me back about $15-20.

# Features

The door can:  
 

* **notifies when left unlocked (Android, Alexa, Google Home)**
* **notifies when left open for a prolonged time (Android, Alexa, Google Home)**
* **Alexa &amp; Google Assistant integration (query door state)**
* **bedtime reminders if the door is unlocked**
* **Geofence/WiFi-based notification**

You will get a timed notification when the door is unlocked (you don't get bothered if you lock the door like a good boy) - the ""locked"" notification was mostly done for the demo.

fl2tzi,1584587289,Stupid question RE: PIR motion sensors specifically ceiling mounted vs ceiling fans. I’m from Texas.,"So......as I mentioned I love in the south where every room in the house has a ceiling fan and we rarely if ever turn them off. Rain shine hot cold we run our fans in the south. 

We recently moved into a new construction home that we have been working towards for the past year and I have made it my mission to automate everything that CAN be automated (whether it needs it or not). Don’t laugh too hard but aside from the Ecobee that came with the house the first real “thing I did” was throw a Hue bulb in the water closet (toilet closet) in the master suite (my bedroom) and add a ST motion sensor......but I’ve been dabbling with proof of concept stuff in our former home for a little less than a year. 

Currently my magic toilet lamp will turn on at full brightness in roughly “normal” color tones between the hours of “we’re awake” and “time for bed” and during sleeping hours it’s set for a red/crimson at the lowest brightness so as to hopefully not disturb night vision or cause myself or the wife to wake up so much we can’t fall back to sleep. Ok......it’s a little funny. 

So I’ve purchased a stack of smart switches to replace the light switches in various places in the house with the long term goal of replacing most/if not all of the light switches in the house as I move forward and whilst brainstorming potential programming scenarios the thought occurred to me......how well do ceiling mount motion detectors play with ceiling fans? 

Top down 360° detection seems the simplest and most efficient means of triggering things but how much of an issue is it for the detection to have a tendency to “see” a fan? Is that a thing? Or does the “visual detection come” tend to simply miss that motion because it’s looking “down” instead of beside itself?",Venmaru,/r/homeautomation/comments/fl2tzi/stupid_question_re_pir_motion_sensors/,2,homeautomation,8

flm5s5,1584667845,"Smart dimmers on ""California style"" wiring","Hi all, I'm a smart-home newbie looking for some wiring advice. I bought a bunch of z-wave dimmers that require a neutral wire. When I opened up a few of my boxes, I found circuits without a neutral wire. Specifically:

2-way: [http://www.electrical101.com/wpimages/optional-light-switch-wiring-diagram-nm.png](http://www.electrical101.com/wpimages/optional-light-switch-wiring-diagram-nm.png)3-way: [http://www.electrical101.com/wpimages/3way-switch-wiring-diagram-nm2.png](http://www.electrical101.com/wpimages/3way-switch-wiring-diagram-nm2.png)

Luckily, the wiring between the light fixture and the primary switch seems to use 3-wire NM. Is it reasonable to open the light fixture and split the neutral wire there, rather than in the switch box?

My plan:- in light box, connect panel neutral to both light and switch (white wire, split)- in light box, forward panel line to switch (black wire)- in light box, connect switched line to light (red wire)

In this scenario the switch box would get a line in, load out, and neutral, allowing me to power the smart dimmers independent of the light. Will this work!?

I'm fine ditching the secondary switch on the 3-way circuit, but maybe I could support it by forwarding travel/neutral/ground only? [https://images.app.goo.gl/AweZqc24o5Evkd8k7](https://images.app.goo.gl/AweZqc24o5Evkd8k7)

Thanks for your help!

\---

EDIT: Splicing the neutral at the fixture and running it into the switch box worked wonderfully, for both 2-way and 3-way circuits. Once the primary switch has all 3 wires (line, load, neutral), all other wiring configurations seem possible. Yay for running 3-wire NM everywhere.

Those are all quite expensive components, each in the 40-70 EUR range and tbh., it's just one room equipped with those devices. When I move to an apartment, there would be at least five light switches, three to four thermostats etc.  
The failing bridge was especially annoying because I figured that in case of smart door locks or maybe automated windows, I could possibly be in a bad situation, should this fail while I'm out and about.  
Did you have devices go bad, do you prepare for it and doesn't this all make smart homes a huge money sink with no longevity in mind? Maybe I was just unlucky.",w00h,/r/homeautomation/comments/flrq6p/home_automation_and_durability/,13,homeautomation,3

fls5h3,1584696521,Domoticz webpage offline but is running,"Hello,

I have installed a raspberry Pi with domoticz and homebridge. Everything is working fine but the domoticz page went offline after about a week of use (might have went offline after a homebridge update, I'm not sure). Everything else is working fine, I just can't reach the page anymore. Its on port 8080, homebridge is on port 8581 and works fine. 

I had this problem before, could not fix it so I re-installed my raspberry. Now I have already invested too much time in configuring everything and I would loose too much time to go for a clean install. 

Can anybody try to point me in the right direction to solve this issue? 

I only use the domoticz page to check on my heater graphs since that's the only thing I can't do from homebridge.

I have Tp-link Kasa switches throughout my home, they work great so far.

I have a 3 way switch in my finished basement I was getting around to changing and apparently this is the one switch I've encountered that does not have white neutral wires in the back of the box.  First time I'm actually seeing white wires directly hooked to the switch.  You can see here - https://m.imgur.com/a/XKd0S2b

There is another switch in the box that is not pictured that has 1 black / 1 white and a ground going to it.  I'm not changing that switch.

The other switch controlling this same set of lights also has no neutral and just 3 wires connected.

So my questions - 

1.) Any chance we know what the black wires capped off in the back are? 

2.)  I know the switch needs a neutral for 24/7 power however will it still function as a switch if pressed without a neutral?  Does that make sense?  I don't need to control this switch 24/7 but it's often left on so my thought is if it still functions as an actual manual switch and has power when it's switched on I'll still be able to switch it off via App.

3.) Will I burn down the house if I wire neutral to ground?

With it, we are suppose to be able to add WIFI enabled devices directly to the SmartThings cloud [see here](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/devices/direct-connected-devices/overview.html) using MQTT.

I have made a custom device (ESP8266) that is using MQTT and it’s working in HA.  I’m thinking of trying to direct-connect it to SmartThings, but I would like to understand better how this works.  Does anyone know if this direct connection is going through the SmartThings hub, or is it directly to the SmartThings cloud?  The diagrams that Samsung have posted show that it goes directly to the cloud, but then they also say you cannot do this without a hub.  The reason I care is I hope that when SmartThings makes the Rules API local, this MQTT direct connection can also be done local (just like I’m doing with HA currently).  Maybe this is just a pipe dream.

Does anyone know the details on how this direct connection works?  Has anyone used it yet?  Any help would be appreciated.

Edit:
I think the main thing I’m wondering is if the SmartThings MQTT client is running on the hub or in the cloud.

WeMo Light Switches - has these previously and they worked. Is there a better cost effective version that works well with the Amazon stuff?

fmk7sf,1584817520,"DIY Nanoleaf - ""Glitch""-Problems","Hey,
I build some DIY Nanoleaf Panels with custom software, running in Micropython on an ESP32 (3.3v). Each of those panels have 15 LEDs inside (cut up SK6812 LEDs into 3 stripes with 5 LEDs per panel).

Now to the problem. Sometimes, whole panels or just some of the LEDs switch (very shortly) to a different color and then switch back. So these are unwanted ""glitches"". Here are some examples: 

[Example 1](https://streamable.com/ocxbj)

fmn5d7,1584826306,Quarantined DIY : Smart IOT doorbell from old &amp; dumb doorbell,"I had this project in mind for a long time, and being stuck inside today I finally decided to go ahead. Things went much smoother than I expected.

[https://imgur.com/a/am41ezr](https://imgur.com/a/am41ezr)

The wiring is temporary as I'm still waiting for some parts (an mp3 module and a speaker) so everything is on a breadboard with no wire color code (I had limited parts) and uses a piezo buzzer.

The old doorbell was disconnected over a year ago, because the old ""ding-dong"" made the dogs bark like crazy.

The first thing I did was to gut the old doorbell ringer box, as I only needed the box itself. I identified which of the two sets of wires was power (16V) and labelled it. I then disconnected the old transformer (right next to the main breaker box) and replaced it with a 5V 2A transformer. That 5V is fed directly to the 5V pin on a Wemos D1 mini. Connected to the GPIO pins are the old doorbell button and a piezo buzzer. The ESP8266 runs a tiny EspHome script that reacts to the button and plays a set of beeps and publishes a message on my MQTT server. On my main Raspberry Pi (a Zero W) a python scripts monitors the MQTT topic and pushes notifications (via Pushover) to my phone.

I'm sure there's a thousand other ways to do it, but I went with what I knew and the parts I had, the end result is perfect for me.",Alex_Sherby,/r/smarthome/comments/fmn5d7/quarantined_diy_smart_iot_doorbell_from_old_dumb/,34,smarthome,7

Two things in particular I'd like to be able to do.
1. I'd like to be able to set a routine up at a specific time. For example I want to be able to say ""wake me up at (time)"" and have a series of alarms set, the lights turn on, the shades open, etc etc at that time and for about half an hour following it.
2. I want the ability to have the color of my lighting change at sunset every day. If the lights are already on, I want the color to change without turning them off, if they're off I'd want them to change color when they turn back on. 

Are both of these possible with alexa? Are they possible with Google and I'm just incompetent? General thoughts on the two of them?

&amp;#x200B;

**DETAILS:** 

I am about to purchase a **Monoprice 6 Zone Home Audio Multizone Controller and Amplifier Kit** ( [https://www.monoprice.com/product?p\_id=10761](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=10761) ) to install in a new home.  And I would like some direction on which Monoprice speakers and possibly some additional gear I might need.

In the not so distant future I may have need for one or two more zones. So I might end up daisy chaining a second **Monoprice 6 Zone** unit.

I will be running 5 of the 6 zones from the initial **Monoprice 6 Zone** to pairs of typical single channel in-ceiling speakers (let's call these speakers *TYPE-1* ). Pretty straightforward. 

The sixth zone is in a bathroom which will have two stereo (4-wire) speakers. One of these speakers must be suitable for wet space inside of a shower ceiling (let's call this speaker *TYPE-2*) and the other is just a typical stereo (4-wire) speaker (let's call this speaker *TYPE-3*).

All speaker locations have 12 gauge wire run to them.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions are:**

1. Can you recommend a few budget speaker models that fit my requirements for *TYPE-1*, *TYPE-2*, and *TYPE-3*?  I do not need anything terribly fancy or terribly loud.  These speakers will be used just for quiet to moderately loud music played throughout a home at times. To keep things simple, I was hoping to get everything from Monoprice.

2. It's been recommended to me that I try to find mounting brackets for in ceiling speakers. What are your thoughts on brackets vs attaching more directly to sheetrock/tdrywall.

3.  If the bathroom zone is to have two 4-wire speakers in it, what is the most economical way for me to set up this zone?  Could I achieve this:

*  by somehow utilizing only a single zone from the ""6 zone controller"" right out of the box? 
*  or by putting an additional splitter / amplifier between a single zone from the ""6 zone controller"" and the bathroom speakers? 
*  or would I need to combine two zones from the ""Monoprice 6 Zone Home Audio Multizone Controller and Amplifier""?
*  or something else?

1. Nest Hello doorbell cam - most opinions were that it was superior to Ring, it also looks nicer
2. Ecobee thermostat - I like that its more customizable, i wish it was nicer looking but I didn't like the idea of having to tie the Nest thermostat to a google account to control it.

After going through my options and researching different products, I have decided to go with a ceiling speaker system and hooking up Echo Dots with in-wall mounts so they are flush in the wall. I chose Echo over Google Home because I wanted the ceiling speakers connected over wifi instead of Bluetooth. I can't find any google device, other than the discontinued Chromecast, that can be hardwired to speakers. However, the way that I am setting up the system will allow me to swap to Google if I want to in the future if the audio output situation changes.

fohljy,1585099692,Pool Heater Temperature Control Upgrade,"I'm trying to upgrade my 20 year pool heater controls. The pool heater still works great, but the controls are very basic. There 2 rotary knob for temperature setpoints, one for spa and one for pool, however we only use the pool since we don't have spa connected. There is also and on/off selector switch. I'd like to upgrade this to some type of smart control that would allow me to set the temperature and turn the heater enable on/off, all remotely. Ideally, I'd like something that I could integrate into the rest of my system with either Insteon, Z wave,  IFTTT, or Alexa. 

My first thought was to use a smart HVAC thermostat. However, I would have to solder a remote probe into the thermostat to pick up the water temp. The current control wiring diagram shows just a dry contact that closes when the temperature is below the knob setpoint. I would have to drive a relay with thermostat that would take the place of the contacts on the controller. 

I have some links to the wiring diagram and picture of the control panel. 

Any ideas on what would work best for this? Most of the pool/spa controllers I have looked up either require you to use their apps and are majorly overpriced.

It doesn't make sense to spend so much money on a smartlock that provides less security than a $60 deadbolt.  If it has a thumb turn, a burglar would only have to break the door window, reach inside and turn it; whereas with a double cylinder lock they'd have to put in more effort.  Is that right?

fpeqv2,1585240887,Wifi plug messing with my PC?,"Hi,

I just got myself a Wifi plug to schedule watering schedules for my plants. Ever since, my desktop has been black screening randomly. I tried reinstalling my graphic card drivers and all the usual fixes but nothing changed, my pc was black screening every hour or so.

That's when I realised that my PC screen is blacking out in sync with my scheduled on/off times of my wifi plug. My wifi plug makes a clicking noise everytime it switches off. and my PC only crashes when the switch goes off.

I know this sounds crazy, so I tried disabling my wifi plug and my PC was stable after that. A couple of hours later I tried toggling my smart plug on/off through my smartphone app and it happened again right in front of my eyes, my PC's screen went black and I had to reboot it to get the screen back again.

This is driving me nuts. Does anyone know what's going on?

Possible FAQ's

1. No, my circuit breaker did not trip, the device connected to my wifi plug is an 8W water pump.
2. The water pump is connected to the wifi plug which is directly connected to the wall socket.
3. My PC is connected to another wall socket across the room.
4. When my PC screen blacks out, Windows locks up (caps lock key light doesn't respond when pressed). I was watching a movie when this happened, and audio continues to play (though I can't pause it through keyboard shortcuts)
5. The crash doesn't always happen when my wifi plug is switched off, but when it does happen, it ALWAYS happens at the exact moment my wifi plug switches off.

PC: Windows 10 - Ryzen 7 1700 - AMD Vega 56

Smart plug app: TuyaSmart

HELP! (i'm losing my mind)

EDIT: Through some experimentation I realised that it only happens when I use a combination of the wifi plug and the water pump. Directly connecting the pump to the wall and switching it on and off doesn't cause a crash, and connecting another device to my wifi plug and switching that on and off doesnt cause a crash either. 

I got myself an UPS and that seemed to fixed the problem with my graphics card crashing though occasionally my pc screen still blacks out for a moment even though i have that connected to the UPS as well. Not too big of a deal but thanks for the help guys!",ngjeehong,/r/smarthome/comments/fpeqv2/wifi_plug_messing_with_my_pc/,13,smarthome,12

I'm looking for a WiFi socket that allows me to check the power consumption of my computer.  

The only feature I need is being able to check how much power my computer is pulling at a given time - example when I'm doing some heavy tasks like gaming etc. I want to see how much is being pulled by my PSU, so I don't really care about estimating costs per year or stuff like that - it would just be a plus.  

I've purchased the Elgato Eve power socket but, I don't know what the hell is going on, I can't plug anything into it! It's just hard af - no plug fits! It's like the children safety protection is stuck and there's no way to plug it, it won't move. The thing is, this is the second one I'm buying and it's got the same issue!  

Has anyone experienced anything similar? I don't know what I'm doing wrong here!!  

Anyway, if you have any other suggestions, please let me know.  

Another thing that makes me want to send back this Eve plug is that it only works via Bluetooth - what the hell? Why not WiFi? but this is my fault, I didnt' read the description lol.  

It should work with Alexa, Apple HomeKit would be a plus but I don't have a hub yet so, perhaps Alexa would be good.

* PIC 2 - There is no switch that controls these - and there is a photo-sensor that is located on side of house that I presume controls these lights.

**Question**: Could there be something else like a timer controlling these lights?? There is no other photo-sensor or light switch for these, so I am really confused how these come on dusk till dawn if not this photo-sensor.

And I'm at a max of like ~45W across the 4 bulbs whereas the switch is supposed to be able to handle up to 150W of LEDs. 

I'm also having a hard time pinpointing what causes it to happen. At first I thought it was when the A/C kicked on but a lot of times I hear the A/C come on and the lights don't flicker, and sometimes the lights start to flicker when the A/C has already been running for like 10 minutes or so.

fqgoex,1585386560,UK - smart light switches with harmony elite compatibility,"Hi

I'm new to smart lighting and looking for some direction. I would like to have access to my lounge lights through my Logitech Harmony Elite remote control. Easy enough, I know, as Harmony has support for Philips Hue and Smartthings, however, I would also like to have a working physical dimmer switch on the wall, as well as the voice/remote control.

The trouble is the Hue and Friends of Hue light switches are all ugly and clunky. I quite like the LightwaveRF Gen2 lightswitches, but Harmony doesn't support. Smartthings has fibaro, but not sure if that will give me what I'm looking for?

Does what I'm looking for exist? Has anyone else got this configuration? Harmony Elite + nice looking light switches + controlable lights? In the UK?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or ideas.

4 of these will be wired and 2 wireless via AP-AC-MESH's

I plugged all the cameras in to test them out before starting to install them properly. I wanted to make sure everything was working and also test out the latency. With Nest, it's not uncommon to have someone knock at the door and a few seconds later get a notification that the camera saw activity, or have some networking issue mean the cameras are wildly out of sync with each other. 4 of these cameras are wired, 2 are wireless via a mesh uplink. I'm not seeing any noticeable latency between them - pretty happy with how it all works.

It all seems very stable now it's setup, but it wasn't particularly smooth. Upgrading the CloudKey took a while. I followed the documented process, but the new cloud key couldn't import a backup from a device with a newer controller version. I updated the version on the new key over SSH but the backup from the migration wizard is buggy and doesn't include account passwords from the old key. After restoring the backup to the new key, I just couldn't login. Apparently, only the scheduled backups work for migration. I went back to the old key and found the scheduled backups had stopped running last year. I eventually figured out this was a permissions issue on the directory where the backups are stored. After fixing that and grabbing a valid backup, I factory reset the new key and ran another controller upgrade via ssh, then it all worked fine. Similar story with the mesh units - they work perfectly on the latest firmware, but getting them onto that version with a clean config is.. tricky.

Anyway, happy it all now works as expected and all seems very solid. Might be able to get one camera installed tomorrow. I will leave the rest running for a week and see how stable it is - particularly the 2 connected over wifi.

Just got a 3 piece TP-Link Deco M5 set up in my 3 story house, one on each floor. It's already working way better than the CenturyLink provided router/modem combo, but I'm feeling like it could be even better. 

I understand that ""Ethernet backhaul"" or connecting them all to each other, will improve performance. But with each being on a separate floor, it's not really an option. 

There ARE Ethernet access points throughout the house, so I'm wondering: 

1. Will having each M5 unit plugged into its own Ethernet access point improve the overall connection? Can they communicate in that way, since they're all in the same house? 

2. If I were to plug them all straight into the wall, what are the best, short, Ethernet cables I should get? And what would be overkill? So far I've read ""5e or better."" Currently the main unit on the middle floor is the one connected through Ethernet with the provided cable, and into the modem.

This Node-RED flow resolves the IP from a device based on MAC address. The MAC address is stored in a global variable and used to ping devices. I've also created a dashboard to show device status, and its IP.

Next up:

* adding all the devices in our home (there are a LOT...)

What I want to have at the user side is a floor plan of my apartment with designated locations of our plants. I'd like to have a small number next to each plant showing the humidity level. I assume this is would be some jazzy web-app. 

The question is:

Are there any broker solutions out there (preferably free) that enable me such an interface ([adafruit.io](https://adafruit.io) maybe or something)? Or should I install mosquitto on my home server and build a web page myself? Any similar project or references would be very helpful.

I could use your advice/ criticism of my planned project.

I’m self isolating with my family currently and so I decided to tackle a project that’s been floating around my head for a while.

I’d like to add a structured media enclosure(thinking about the plastic Leviton 42 inch panel)  into our front entrance closet on the main floor of our 2 storey home.

I’ve managed to fish a rope between the aforementioned front closet, down through the finished basement ceiling, to the back of basement where our coaxial cable connection is located. 

My plan was to run a coaxial cable back up to the new panel, run a cat 6A cable down to the basement and then upstairs to our home office, another 6A cable to the basement for future use.

I was also thinking of running a new doorbell wire along this same run(unless perhaps ppoe is better!?).

Our router, modem and several home automation hubs will be located within the panel as well.

Any ideas or suggestions that I haven’t thought of?

frx9pu,1585596079,EcoBee W2 and E Help,"Hi all,

I'm trying to install an EcoBee thermostat in a condo. The building was built in the late 70s and has a heat pump/electric back up heat system, and a rooftop compressor for cooling. According to one of the neighbors you can't install an Ecobee because you ""need"" a { local contractor} specialty thermostat. I'm calling BS on that as cooling work fine, but is there any cause for concern here?

What I'm confused on is how to install the heating wires. According to EcoBee's website, you just drop the E wire and put the W2 in the W1 slot. Anyone run into this particular set up?

I currently have the W2 in W1, E in W2 and everything else to their respective letters (with the exception of L which is not needed).

Bottom pic is what I am dealing with, tried to draw it out as best I could. 

So half my house has old wiring, and the other half is more up to date. I have 2 electrical boxes, one is the push button and the other is a normal flip breakers. 

I have installed multiple smart switches that have the neutral wire. But in my kitchen, it doesn’t seem to have a neutral wire. The main light is next to an outlet. The wires are brown and not white (in the fixture, white wire on the switch), or maybe white at some point and turned brown. What are my options WITHOUT changing the switch (the switches are designer switches and the wife wants those to stay)? I will be using Lutron Caseta for the rest of the switches but can’t for this setup. Was going to go with a Shelly 2.5 but that requires a neutral wire if I am not mistaken. 

Also, not sure where the red wire came from, there isn’t another switch anywhere for that light so not sure if they had a 3 way switch at some point. It’s a mystery since that usually signifies a 3 way.",fingerbangher,/r/homeautomation/comments/frycpb/any_way_to_add_a_smart_switch_to_this_wiring/,0,homeautomation,7

frzuha,1585604306,"Which Ecosystem Should I Use, and Why?","Hey all,
I know there are loads of threads about this. I've read the pros and cons of each one, but my situation is so weird and unique that it's incredibly hard to parse it all out.
Basically, I have a separate-from-my-house ""shack""; I'm setting it all up and everything now, but I want to make it smart. Currently, in my house, I have the Nest ecosystem. To be homest, I'm quite unhappy with their restrictiveness, but I'm not about to completely redesign my smart home. I figured this shack would be a good exuse to adopt a new system.
In it, currently, I have a Dyson HP04 Heat + Cool, which works officially with Alexa and unofficially with HomeAssistant. I also have some cheap WiFi light bulbs that are part of Smart Life / Tuya, so they work with IFTTT, Google Home, Alexa, Home Assitant, and more (but not SmartThings or Wink). I have several other devices that seem to work with everything, including a Harmony, Wemo, and Geeni Floodlight / Camera. Oh, and, though definitely not expected, I'd love to be able to play media on my Chromecast Audio.
Here's the last confusing part: I wanted a door lock. I found one[one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072NCJTNG/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_opMGEbK94KN2N) that's only $30(!!!!). Though it says it requires the Amazon Cloud Cam, apparently it works with any Zigbee hub. So with that, I'm buying a zigbee hub.

So now, with all of that, which ecosystem do I choose?? Nest won't work with Dyson or the lock, unless y'all know of a Nest-compatible Zigbee hub. Alexa will probably work, but that's just a voice assistant; there's no central interface.
So it comes to SmartThings vs Wink vs HomeAssistant. I don't have much money, so I'm getting a SmartThings v1 hub (~$15 on ebay), a Wink Relay (~$30-40 on ebay), or a HomeAssistant Zigbee dongle (I have a raspberry pi already, but I can't find a cheap dongle).
HomeAssistant: looks great and like it will work with everything, but apparently it can only control simple switches and lights over Zigbee.
Wink: Obviously outdated and going under, but the Relay is so nice! I would love to have that thing installed. Might root it and use SmartThings if neccesary. To me, Wink looks the same as SmartThings, besides the Relay and how it ha(d) Nest functionality (so they might bring it back if Google gets their act together). Unfortunately, apparently it's terrible and keeps going down.
SmartThings: Good and cheap. Would have to root the Wink Relay to use it. Neither it nor Wink has Dyson support, but I can use Harmony as a last resort.

Sorry y'all; that's a lot. There's just so much that goes into this. People who use any of these ecosystems, what do you think I should do? Any ideas?
I thank you greatly for any input (though hopefully no hate haha) :)",cleanofficial,/r/homeautomation/comments/frzuha/which_ecosystem_should_i_use_and_why/,0,homeautomation,5

I'm computer savvy, but not really network savvy. I just purchased the Samsung Electronics ET-WV525KWEGUS Mesh Router 3 pack and am using an AT&amp;T Uverse-provided 5268AC DSL modem. 

My use case is fairly middle of the road. Two adults, a handful of smarthome devices (several alexa dots, 4 roku wireless devices, two smart TVs, 3 ecobee thermostats), a bunch of mobile browsing and mobile games. We will be doing occasional video chats in the near future (likely zoom, depending on what the school district decides the  teachers will use) but are mostly concerned about video streaming within the house. We do use a PC to stream video via Plex to our devices.

I plan to put:

One unit in my office, hardwired to the modem

One unit in my gameroom/bar, hardwired via 50' cat-5 to the modem

One unit in the upstairs landing area, not hardwired to anything.

The modem has wifi built in, should I disable that entirely? Set it up with the same credentials? Set it up with different credentials as a fallback?

Do I want the second hardwired unit daisy chained to the first unit, or the modem?

Do I want the PC connected to the first unit or the modem? (This is an either/or with the previous question).

I have a four port network switch in the garage somewhere whose model number I don't have handy, is it wise to wire that to the second samsung mesh router for the smart tv (mostly not used, the roku there is more useful) and blu ray etc or let them be wireless?

Lastly, I've been hubless until now (this is a smartthings hub built into the router).

For instance, I have some cheapo offbrand outlet/nightlight combos.

I started by building my first furniture pieces about 6 years ago. Then I added led backlights to some of them. At some point I discovered Arduinos, the Rasperry Pi and later the ESP8266 and started integrating them into my projects to control the lights.

From there my path was set: OpenHAB, Alexa, DIY Sensors (the awesome MySensors project), Zigbee, Tradfri... I guess most of you know all about this. Over time my smart home evolved and although I made a lot of errors on the way I also learned a lot and had a lot of fun. Recently I decided to start sharing my thoughts and projects that are part of this journey.

So if anyone is interested: here is my first blogpost about the lessons I learned during the last few years of building a smart home: [https://thesmarthomejourney.com/2020/03/16/6-lessons-perfect-smart-home/](https://thesmarthomejourney.com/2020/03/16/6-lessons-perfect-smart-home/)

Here is the short summary

&gt;1. Build your setup to work independently of external sources  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Make best use of a combination of multiple ways to control your devices  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Use automation as much as possible  
&gt;  
&gt;4.  Start with actual useful devices, add ""fun"" stuff afterwards  
&gt;  
&gt;5. Build your smart home in a way that makes it useable for others, not just yourself  
&gt;  
&gt;6. Don't spend too much money on devices, but once you found something that works for you go ""all in"" and actually use it wherever it might be useful

I just moved into a two-story house. About 20' from the back wall of the house I have a 200sf outbuilding.

I bought an Aeotec Range Extender 6 in hopes that that would help. It didn't; although I was eventually able to pair it as a generic ZWave switch to the hub, it doesn't seem to do anything.

Keep in mind I’m more of an IT girl than an electrician.

TL;DR -- I want to to be like you guys when I grow up...what lighting products should I invest in now to make automation easier in the future?",___coolcoolcool,/r/homeautomation/comments/fsfcri/which_switch_and_outdoor_lights_will_serve_me/,8,homeautomation,23

fsgeu9,1585673371,Looking for People Who'd Like to Help with a Bachelor Thesis (Respondents for Two Focus Groups),"Hello people of r/homeautomation !

First and foremost, excuse me if I make some grammatical errors, English isn't my native language.

My name is Ola. Me and a classmate are currently writing our bachelor thesis in Digital Media Production. DMP is basically the place where you become a jack of all trades in digital design (such as creating logos, editing video, sound and pictures or designing web pages) and media production (pretty much most of the things that happen behind the camera) but enough about that. 

As I previously mentioned, we are currently writing our bachelors degree and we chose to write about virtual assistants and how people who use them has changed their behavior, or well, changed the way they do things in their everyday life to how they behaved when they did things analogously.

We are hence looking for six people who would be willing to join for a focus group (we are doing two, three people per group) and answer/discuss a few questions around their usage of virtual assistants such as Google Home or Alexa, and how their behavior in everyday life has changed post starting to use these VAs. Preferably as soon as possible. 

I know this post is getting kind of big but I feel like it is also necessary as the more info I give the less of a problem it becomes later on. Now on to the technicalities and integrity of respondents. (Sounds boring, is necessary):

As the university has shut down attendance due to Covid-19 we are flexible with time (we are on CEST) we can pretty much do these whenever, and as we don't want to make to much of a problem for respondents we'll try to get those with time-zones as close to each other as possible in the same group. 
We'll use some software where group-call is available (Discord, Zoom, Skype).
This should probably only take somewhere between 30-90 minutes (hopefully, as we need to transcribe everything).
The call will be recorded, if allowed, so that we can transcribe it, for easy access to the answers.

As for the integrity of our respondents:
All respondents will be completely anonymous on the thesis.
A respondent can, during any point in time, choose to not finish and have their partition in the focus group be null/deleted from the record.
Choose to not answer a question.
If they want, get access to the final paper. (It's getting written in Swedish but I am willing to rewrite it in English in case someone wants it, as long as that is acceptable according to our supervising teacher.)

If this sounds interesting, or you have questions, don't hesitate to send a pm.

Thanks in advance!

I recently installed a relay and a smart plug in my gas fireplace.  Works great.  I am slightly paranoid about it somehow going on by itself although I can't see how unless the voice command were spoken.

But anyway, is there a way through Alexa routines to turn off a plug or switch if it has been left on for a certain amount of time?  Other than creating random ""off"" schedules?  I do have Simple Commands installed on my phone if that is an option?

fsjat7,1585682395,Recently bought some smartthings devices but just found out most of the custom functionality is going away soon,"I just bought a v3 smart things hub, some motion sensors, and a contact sensors and started with some automation. I ran into some issues connecting my leviton devices to the smart things app and so I opened a case with samsung. When the rep called, I was walking her thru some of the things I'd tried to make it work, including things in the IDE. She informed me that within the next few months, the IDE and the classic app would be going away, and there would be no way to make custom device handlers, or custom smart apps in order to facilitate automation. The only things possible would be the dozen or so automation options available in the mobile app. 

This effectively means that all of my smart things devices are going back to the store, and i'll have to find new ways if I want to build some automations like motion / vacancy sensors triggering certain actions, or making my garage door relay have awareness of whether the door is already opened or closed. 

so is there  a new way to build custom applications or perform more robust automations with smart things scaling back a ton?",tjpoe,/r/homeautomation/comments/fsjat7/recently_bought_some_smartthings_devices_but_just/,2,homeautomation,21

fskn36,1585686601,Water tank overflow problem," Hi all,

I am trying to find the best, most reliable solution to the following problem:

I have a pit in my basement where rainwater collects (for some reason which we cannot fix permanently) which may cause a lot of damage in the event that it overflows. Inside this pit is a water pump which pumps out water and is activated through a float switch. However, since it is critical that the pump works at all times, I would like to place a water sensor to notify me in case the water reaches a certain level (indicating that there is some kind of fault with the water pump).

Since it is very critical that I am aware of water reaching a certain level immediately (as water may eventually reach the lift shaft if action is not taken immediately) the notification needs to be in the form of a phone notification/SMS and not just an audible alarm. Furthermore, it would be also be even better if in some manner (through Smartthings/IFTTT/Zigbee etc), a secondary pump is turned on if water is detected at a certain level. I have 2 zigbee plugs and a Smartthings hub at home, so I think this kind of automation is possible.

Also, being a critical sensor, it would be fundamental that a notification is also sent in case the connection with the water detection device is lost or battery is low.

Would anyone happen to know of any possible solution/potential hardware which would work to help solve this problem please?

I would be so grateful!",theuma121,/r/homeautomation/comments/fskn36/water_tank_overflow_problem/,5,homeautomation,10
