If those critics lived anywhere other than the US they'd be talking about how all the features that the US have had for years are still not available in Other regions. <NEW TIER> Agreed, the title is too biased to get me to read it. This it the OPs title, not the article's title based on the link preview that shows up when I hover my mouse over the link. Amazon's marketing is too smart to dish up titles like this. :) <NEW TIER> I just assumed that anyone saying that telecoms offering a good deal is just some viral marketing to be trolled as much as possible.  Then you wait for their legion of bots to downvote the negative comments.",/r/smarthome/comments/9mgu58/sorry_apple_and_google_critics_gushing_over_new/

What I'd really like to see is some low cost thermal imaging sensors that can canvas a room. That would detect you lounging on the couch or at your desk etc.  If you could tweak the threshold you can exclude small animals. That would be the ideal way. But I don't expect to see that anytime soon.

The best we have to day is really bluetooth signal strength measuring... but it's got very mixed reliability. <NEW TIER> Motion is the right option for a bunch of situations but not all of course. People haven't used them the way to use it for this type of presence detection.  Example is usually lights so let's take each door or say stairs you need two motion detectors to detect when someone is there but also which direction. Using two motion sensors you can tell which room a person is going in and can also tell how many based on the triggers as once you know someone has triggered into a room you know if someone else has as well if it's directly after them. The main way is to turn the motion sensors into a motion beam you block most of the motions lens to only capture a tiny area. Now this works well and rarely has issues but it's not always useful for all houses but works with most and works well for the bathroom light to stay on for the shower as well <SAME TIER> I'm working on building a smart home system that uses thermal sensors placed in each room to do what you're suggesting. So far, its working pretty well but still have a lot of work to do to make it commercially viable. <NEW TIER> How to they work when the furnace is running? <SAME TIER> Motion != Presence

That’s the confusion. Motion detection is for motion. Presence is not motion. Motion is not presence. <SAME TIER> Fantastic! <NEW TIER> What do you mean?  <SAME TIER> Well it does notify of a presence but maybe not in the application you want to use it in but they can be used for presence as I described.\

I think the lowest for of presence we want in the house atm is to know how many people are in a room.  
  
Knowing more like who is in the room is obviously better for some applications but knowing how many people went in and out of a room is handy and in a lot of situations motion can be used to get this data as I explained above.

  
Obviously if your just using motion to turn on a light for 10 minutes not knowing your still there just haven't moved then that isn't helpful in a lot of applications but the above I mentioned can extend that. <NEW TIER> Thermal sensors would pick up hot spots where at HVAC systems are dumping heat into the room.  How do the thermal sensors know the difference between hot air coming out of a vent or off of a heat exchanger and a human?

PIR sensors are effectively thermal sensors, but they require movement for the very reason of being able to tell the difference between a hot air source and a human.  Wouldn't a sensor that was just looking for a heat signature throw false positives on stationary objects? <NEW TIER> Ah, yes you're right - my business partner is a home builder and for the first version of this smart home system we're building, we're building it to be installed in a home that we're currently building. So, we're hoping to solve this problem you've outlined on the software side of the sensor by programming the system to ignore known stationary heat sources such as heat vents and what not. In our case, we're using radiant floor heating so there are no vents blowing hot air in our house but, instead, the problem now is that the whole floor is warm lol. We think we can either shorten the detection distance of the sensor so the floor isn't within its field of view (only standing, sitting or lying-down humans will be) or, just calibrate the sensor against the radiant heated floor such that it still can measure a temperature difference between the background and a human (which is all you need really, in order to detect human presence). 


Still, we have a lot of experimenting to conduct within the next month or so. We of course want to be able to create a smart home system that is stand-alone and can be sold to a consumer where they can install it in their house themselves but then we wouldn't be able to program the location of stationary heat sources for each room so we're not sure what to do about that yet.",/r/smarthome/comments/8kl79t/motionoccupancy_sensor_recommendation/

Our plugs don’t do that right now but we could have them do that ...  <NEW TIER> That was pretty much what I expected, I just didn't know what brands (if any) supported that.  Just curious - who is ""we"" in this case? How can we get this scenario enabled? <NEW TIER> I manufacture smart plugs and sell them on amazon. They will work with the smart life app too (although we have our own app as well)  <NEW TIER> Link? Let me know if you decide to support this scenario. <NEW TIER> You can find us by searching for “GreenDot smart home” on amazon. I’ll talk with the team about supporting it for the next iteration or possibly updating our firmware to support this ",/r/smarthome/comments/9oja0k/smart_plug_default_to_on/
