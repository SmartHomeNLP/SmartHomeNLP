"Looking for a smart lock that would work on commercial door. Deadbolt on top. Handle on the bottom that turns. <SUB> NULL <SUB> I would check August. Works on almost any dead bolt. Their website has a compatibility list, not sure how complete it is though. "


"Google Assistant Leading the Way in Smart Home Technologies <SUB> NULL <SUB> &gt; ""It looks like Google and Amazon are breaking away from Siri -- HomeKit -- in the first lap,"" 

HAHAHA... Breaking away? Siri/Homekit wasn't even a contender when the race started. They were in the stands watching, and so was Google for a little bit.  While Google is catching up to Amazon quickly, Amazon started this race, alone. 

Amazon, however, is still in the lead. Google has done a lot of good things with their smart speakers but Amazon has more products, more skills, and more abilities. If Amazon doesn't watch out, Google will pass them, and possibly soon. However, this race has two runners, Amazon and Google. There is no way, at this point, can Siri/Homekit be a serious contender. It will be a niche player and only appealing to Apple fans. "


"Having issues with smart plugs, bulbs, etc 2.4ghz? <SUB> Hi, ok so I've been having issues with several smart plugs, bulbs etc, I have a mesh connection and these devices I just mentioned keep disconnecting. However everything connected through the 5ghz network work just fine, laptops, smartphones etc.

How can I fix this? Should I set up a new 2.4ghz network only instead of the mesh connection?

Thanks in advance <SUB> Try assigning static IP's if you can to the bulbs and plugs.  That should help a lot. <NEW TIER> How can I do that? Can you refer to a YouTube video maybe? Thanks <NEW TIER> Well, I don't know the router you have, but Google it with the term Static IP.  Something will come up. <NEW TIER> OK cool thanks"


"New smarthome user, help me pick the right system <SUB> Hi all,

I've recently purchased a new home and want to make it a smart one. I'm going to start out with thermostat, door locks, and garage door opener. Later on I'll probably integrate cameras, lights, plugs, etc. The goal is to be able to monitor/control the key systems of the house from our phones while we're home and away. 

The main caveat is that while my wife is reluctantly allowing me to nerd out on the house, if she can't control things through one simple app, she's going to lose it and make me go back to the old fashioned manual stuff. So, I come to you internet experts for advice. What kind of system should I be looking into? 

I had been thinking of starting with a Nest thermostat and connecting 'works with Nest' devices from there, but can Nest app control everything for me?   
If not Nest, than is Samsung SmartThings the way to go?

For a little background on what we currently have to integrate, we are both Android users, don't currently have any smart speakers (but will likely add something), have Samsung smart tv's and Windows pc's.

And not sure if it matters, but I'm in Vancouver, Canada. <SUB> If you eventually want to expand beyond thermostats and locks, you're going to want to go with a hub like SmartThings or Wink. These are going to offer the greatest selection of devices and allow you control everything through one app. It will also integrate with whatever voice assistant you select, so that all those devices and automations can be triggered by voice commands. 

I have over 40 smart switches and plugs, door locks, 3 thermostats, garage door, alarm system, water heater and a few other things all working with SmartThings and Google Home. It all works great, and I'm really happy with the choices I've made.  

As far as how you control it... the sky is the limit really. Voice commands are the easiest and ones we use most often. Phones are the obvious choice for when you're not at home. Guests have access to several ""remote control"" tablets that are placed around the house. It's difficult to teach guests your voice commands, so I've found that having a simple menu for them to use works best. I've got 3 8"" Amazon Fire tablets placed around the house with a kiosk style interface like this: https://i.imgur.com/4UhWXKw.png
 <NEW TIER> How do you mount them to the wall? I want to do this setup too, but am trying to figure the best way to mount tablets.  <SAME TIER> Even at 11:12 AM, I call BS on that traffic. While 290 and 610 @ the Galleria might be legit, i10 is never green unless it's between the hours of 2am - 5am. 

;D <SAME TIER> DavidAg02,

Out of curiosity and interest to do the same, where did you get the map showing traffic for your area for your media tile?

Does it also auto refresh to show up to date traffic? Been wanting to do the same thing for a while but could not locate a source for the media tiles. <SAME TIER> &gt;DavidAg02

[DavidAg02](https://www.reddit.com/user/DavidAg02) \- The tablets around the house - love the idea. Your ""Dashboard"" is exactly what I'm trying to figure out how to do. If you don't mind me asking, how did you set that up? <NEW TIER> It's a gift that updates automatically every few minutes. Found it on my local news stations website!  <SAME TIER> You're wife (and guests) will love it. You can do this on any Android phone or tablet. 

The dashboard is created by an app called ActionTiles. It's a web based service, which means that you build your dashboard on the web, then access it through any web browser. There is a license fee for it (less than $30), and it's good for as many devices as you want to run it on.

To take it a step further, I run it on a web browser (available on Android Play Store) called Fully Kiosk. It allows you to basically ""lock"" the screen to that dashboard. You can even run a screen saver of anything you want... weather, calendar, family photos, etc. and have the tablet's front camera act as a motion sensor that switches the dashboard on when you walk up to it.

Lot's of YouTube videos for this. Just search ActionTiles.  <NEW TIER> Thanks, might have to go check my local news sites now. <SAME TIER> I consider myself pretty into smart home tech and haven’t heard of action tiles. Thanks a bunch. Might use it for my next project (touch panel)
 <SAME TIER> &gt; ActionTiles

You rock. Thanks! I'm going to check out out for sure! <NEW TIER> I'm pretty sure this is the video I used to set it up...
