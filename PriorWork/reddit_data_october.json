{"jb393t": ["Mega \"Reasons to Avoid WiFi Products\" thread\nThird installment in what's become my \"Mega\" articles. See \"[Getting Started\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/f7ezgt/mega_getting_started_thread/) and \"[reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/j9wih0/personal_mega_review_thread/)\".\n\n\nWiFi devices are common, and appealing since they usually don't require a hub/bridge/router/switch/controller. This makes Wifi devices a great choice for beginners. I don't want to discourage beginners from taking the leap into smart hominess, but it is best to avoid WiFi. Sometimes that's not possible  or impractical (eg security cameras and tvs), but otherwise buying any WiFi product should be considered a temporary solution. What works for one device may not work for 10. Below are the reasons why, and some of these only manifest after having numerous devices, and/or compound with many devices.\n\n1) Different devices have different network needs of speed vs bandwidth. Phones, tvs, etc., require a balance between number of requests (latency) and data usage (bandwidth). Smart home products make many tiny requests, often with a need for super fast response times (eg you will notice any delay over about 100ms when turning on a light, but you aren't going to notice the buffer bar of YouTube being 50ms shorter). Too many requests can slow a router that is designed for higher throughput and fewer connections.  This is true for any network, but adding home automation devices to a home network compounds the risk. Not only can home automation suffer from playing a video game while streaming video, but playing a video game can suffer from home automation devices. It would be best to separate high bandwidth from high request devices to separate networks - see #6.\n\n2) Inference is a bitch! Interference isn't just caused by two sets of signals drowning each other out... Electromagnetic waves bounce off of (or bent by) obstacles, like walls, which create eddies. Interference can cause lag, lost data, less range, lower signal strength, and dead zones, which makes it particularly hard to diagnose. While interference can happen with any network, WiFi uses longer-range, higher power signals than ZigBee or Z-Wave, therefore all-else-equal will have more interference. Device placement within the topography of a home can also affect interference. Home automation devices tend to be scattered haphazardly, which logically would result in more interference, and also makes it more likely for one to be in a dead zone.\n\n3) ZigBee and Z-Wave are as secure as possible short of using candles, since they have a limited command structure. Although an attacker could (hypothetically) send a command like \"turn off\", they can't send an unexpected command, and there's far less potential for \"malformed packets\". ZigBee and Z-Wave devices are essentially unhackable.\n\n4) By combining home automation with internet devices, they essentially share security risks. The types of exploits used for a smartphone are different than those used for a thermostat or a Hue. High value targets like computers put smart home products at risk - and often unsecure smart home products put computers at risk. And smart home products that use apps... are both. It would be best to separate devices that require internet to separate networks - see #6.)\n\n5) Despite \"mesh WiFi\" routers being a thing, WiFi is not mesh. ZigBee and Z-Wave *devices* act as repeaters. In general, more devices will cause a WiFi network to get worse and decrease range. In general, Z-Wave and ZigBee networks get stronger and increase range.\n\n6) WiFi has a hard maximum of 255 devices, often far less depending on the router (see #1). That's comparable to ZigBee and Z-Wave controllers, but if you reach the device limit (or if #1), bridging multiple WiFi networks can be pretty difficult. However, it's typically easy to bridge multiple ZigBee and Z-Wave networks. Indeed, ZigBee has a theoretical maximum of ~15 million devices, so it's not bridging networks, it's essentially connecting two controllers to one network. (Z-Wave has a maximum of 255 devices per network.)\n\n7) While many people cite price as a reason to use WiFi, the reverse can be the true. While WiFi devices can be bought on the cheap, comparing brand-to-brand prices are equivalent (eg comparing Hue to LifX, or Sengled to Gledopto). More to the point, (if #1, #4, or #6) a decent WiFi router  range from $200 to $400. Even if you already have quality router, that cost can't be ignored because #1, #4, and #6. A ZigBee or Z-Wave \"router\" (ie SmartThings, Hubitat Elevation, hass, Hue hub, etc.) range from $75 to $150.\n\n8) WiFi devices are often harder to install. This ranges from YAH (Yet Another Hub) to YAA (Yet Another App) to entering the WiFi password to setting a dedicated IP. If you have decent security practices, it becomes yet more difficult with the potential for setting up port forwarding, adding a firewall rule, and/or excluding the device from internet access. While that can apply to Z-Wave and ZigBee, it would only be for the hub/bridge (like the Hue hub, rather than an individual LifX bulb). See #3.\n\n9) WiFi devices can have hidden maintenance headaches should you need to change the network name, password, and/or router IP. Additionally, devices many require being reset or reconnected if the internet router is changed, even for an identical model. Specifically, my Hue hub required a factory reset. Z-Wave can have a similar issue where either the radio needs to replicate the network id, or devices need to be \"excluded\".\n\n10) Using (or integrating) WiFi devices can also be difficult (or outright impossible) with apps, custom drivers, or gawd forbid 3 party cloud servers going through IFTTT to a 5th party cloud server.\n\n11) WiFi devices will often be exposed to anyone on the WiFi network just by downloading an app, so after having a few too many, Uncle Ralph could think turning the lights and sprinklers on and off is a real hoot. This is easy to get around, by having a \"guest password\", but it's not something most people do.\n\n12) Finally, it's easier to switch control platforms with ZigBee or Z-Wave devices such as from Hubitat Elevation to Home Assistant. Although it can be very difficult, at worst it's a repetition of having added them to begin with. The equivalent for WiFi of switching from Windows to Apple or from Android to iOS would most likely be impossible. While most people don't switch, home automation - while never future proof - should be built for the long term.

They don't allow extracting or injecting data that isn't exposed on the network to begin with. My IoT network is connected to my WiFi/tcp-ip network through a controller/bridge.

I also looked into openHAB which i could get installed on the same Pi via Docker, but i think thats a bit overkill and i\u2018m afraid that this would cause to much maintenance.\n\nSo is there a simple solution for my target?\n\nThanks ahead and have a nice day :)", "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/jflz4o/beginner_how_can_i_control_smart_plugsled_strips/", 1, 10, "homeautomation", "security", {"g9l82ns": ["Your two current different manufacturers _will_ become more as time goes on and you get more devices, so now is the time to get your infrastructure in place to make that easier, otherwise you'll be juggling even more apps!\n\nopenHAB is a great home automation platform, and is what I've chosen, as all my device types are supported.\n\nTheir app works on both Android and iOS, and their Cloud offering is free, and gives you access inside and outside your home WiFi with the same app.\n\nYou can also connect it to Alexa and Google for further integrations and voice control, again free of charge.", 1, "t3_jflz4o"], "g9lutep": ["Here is my primer on HA tech\n\nTechnologies: Zwave, zigbee and insteon are \"full stack\" automation solutions. What that means is that communication layer, enrollment, encryption, API and device attributes are baked in. Every smart switch uses the \"switch\" profile and the command for \"light on\" is always the same. Zwave and zigbee allow for new, novel commands when new device types hit the market. They are not IP/wifi-based (they have their own network technology) .\n\nZwave, zigbee, and insteon use mesh radio networks. Low power, so battery friendly, and the mesh let's them have decent range. However only mains-powered devices can act as relays. Zwave is 900Mhz (good signal penetration for power but frequency varies by country), zigbee is 2.4Ghz (which can conflict with bluetooth and wifi b). Insteon is 900Mhz and also has powerline signaling as well in a dual-path configuration that is great in concrete block/steel housing that eats RF.\n\nCompare to wifi devices, which are wifi+tcp+ip+custom encryption+custom API+custom attributes. \"Wifi\" is just networking, there are several more components you need for device controls and they are very disparate. Even a \"standards\" based solution using MQTT as the API layer can have devices of the same type with radically different commands and attributes (lights on/off, power true/false, etc) or implement different encryption schemes. In zwave, zigbee, insteon the command for \"power on/off\" is clearly defined. Wifi also has security concerns as IoT devices have become prime targets for botnets.\n\nYes, ZWave, Zigbee, Insteon require hubs/controllers. Guess what? So do the wifi devices! They have a doodad (wifi access point) that connects to a phone/tablet/cloud. Surprise! Those are computers running a program to be the brain! Want a less pleasant surprise? A lot of the times (like &gt;80% of the time) that computer requires some cloud computer to be online. If there's any internet problems or the people running that cloud computer shut it down, your stuff stops working. Even less pleasant, you may need multiple clouds, meaning there are 2 or 3 different ways your gear can turn into doorstops. E.g. Using Alexa to control a Tuya bulb. Amazon has to be reachable for the echo to work and then they have to have the connector to the Tuya/SmartLife cloud AND your bulb has to be logged into the Tuya cloud. If Amazon decides to stop supporting Tuya, it breaks. If Tuya decides to shut down their system, it breaks. If your internet is down, it breaks. If Amazon's internet is down, it breaks. If Tuya's internet is down, it breaks.\n\nI prefer zwave for a couple reasons. First, Zwave mandates compliance and security testing. A handful of devices with implementation flaws have slipped through over the last 15 years and then the compliance test is updated to prevent that from happening again. With Zigbee that's optional. I also hearken from the bad old days where companies abused zigbee' custom configuration option and made ALL commands custom (I believe Xiaomi is still bad about this as they don't follow the officials zigbee spec). Zwave allows manufacturer specific commands but only when an existing command isn't appropriate, and it is enforced. Lastly, zwave has more 110v devices (switches, plugs, power strips), locks, thermostats and smoke/co detectors. There are various reasons but short answer is most retailers require110v devices/smoke detectors/locks/thermostats to have UL/ETL certification which is expensive and most zigbee device manufacturers are going for low cost/low overhead.\n\nZigbee is great if you want a lot of battery powered sensors on the cheap. The other thing it has a lot of is bulbs, due to Hue using the LightLink flavor of zigbee. It has been chosen by IKEA as their tech standard, which may be a plus. The last thing to remember for zigbee is that you need a Zigbee3 controller. Prior to Zigbee3 you either had a ZigbeeLL (lighting products) or a ZigbeeHA (locks, sensors, etc plus lights, but not the same commands as LL) and the two didn't talk. They still won't talk to each other, but Zigbee3 controllers will talk to both. Eventually all the old zigbee LL/HA devices will fade from the market but it will be a while.\n\nInsteon is sole source. Pretty gear, well made, all works together, but one supplier. I like options. But its like more Apple than Apple.\n\nControllers come in cloud-based and local processing flavors. What this means is a local processing controller will work without an internet-hosted service. SmartThings, for instance, loses most automations when their service is unavailable and you can't control the devices at all when that happens as the phone app connects to the ST cloud. (They are changing some of that but also abandoning their old software APIs so lots of ST functions are going to break) a controller where all the logic runs in your house will keep doing its thing even if the internet goes down, let alone a specific web service.\n\nIn the \"open box, start using it\" category, Homeseer, Hubitat and Apple Homekit are local systems. In the build-it-yourself category, HomeAssistant has the most vocal fan base followed by OpenHab. The other controllers I know of require some cloud services or they become either mindless zombies or doorstops. (Or are end-of-life and not worth buying right now, like Vera or alpha status like EzLo)\n\nUnless you are a tinkerer, I recommend using pre-built controllers. Home automation is complicated enough to get the automation logic working the way you want to also have to exert effort on getting the controller running.\n\nController wise, I use HomeSeer. They have been around for 20 years and make devices as well as controllers so they have a solid engineering core. It's a bit more expensive in some cases (like if you have 2 of each technology and don't standardize) but all HA is expensive so cheaping out on the brains seems stupid. Like \"hiring a teenager to drive your limo because you can pay them minimum wage\" stupid.\n\nI like HS because it is rock solid, worked out of the box, I have root access to the hardware so I can add other software if I want, and it meets my \"able to make backups and shift to other hardware\" requirement. They also have a deep product range, with cheap but powerful intro model based on a Pi3b and go up to x86 win10 appliances and can run on my hardware.\n\nHomeseer was my 3rd controller and I wanted something I could get up and running fast as I already had 3 dozen devices and a host of automations to recreate. Homeseer let me set up and migrate all the devices on a saturday and I got the automations figured out on sunday. Very high spousal approval factor (SAF). It plays nice with Alexa and Google.\n\nIf you really have your eye on Zigbee, Hubitat is a good choice. The system has zigbee and zwave radios built in and it supports a large number of zigbee devices. Iirc, xioami devices are supported by 3rd party drivers. But the hardware has less cpu power so it can get overwhelmed by large installs or complex automations. It too works with Google and Alexa.\n\nApple people will gravitate to homekit. Its not a bad choice but product selection is limited. Homekit is a special thing. Its a mix of wifi with custom APIs and bluetooth with custom APIs. Apple validates all of it so its solid and it is a local system, using an ipad or appletv as the hub. (I recommend the appletv just because you don't want to accidentally take your home controller on vacation or let its battery die.) But...its got apple fingerprints all over it but its dependent on 3rd party suppliers. Apple isn't great at having business partners so it is a little worrisome. Plus, you know, Apple walled garden.\n\nBut it works with Siri. And it's about the only thing that does work with Siri officially. There is a kind of backdoor using an app called HomeBridge, which uses Homekit developer APIs to let you connect some other controller (pretty much anything I have mentioned above) to Homekit.

Most of my light switches are Insteon, although I have a few Inovelli's just to fill in the Z-Wave network, because I have a couple of Z-Wave power outlets that I want to use, mostly at Christmas time.\n\nI don't use any of Insteon's cloud-based crap; only the PLM's (including a spare!). Z-Wave on serial, but also an AD2USB to include my non-monitored Honeywell alarm system into the fold, plus the assorted Hue where I want color.\n\nUsing expanded alarm zones, I've got an Insteon door switch (radio only) configured as an alarm panel zone, and now that I think of it, two Inovelli ambient sensors in the alarm panel, too.\n\nMy house has a bunch of switched outlets instead of overhead lights, so anywhere I have Hue, I hardwired the power to the outlet, and installed the Insteon as a switch only. (There was no Inovelli then.) This lets me control the Hue via HA. And since I don't believe in having tablets and control panels or being tied to a phone, I take advantage of fast-on/fast-off in HA, as well as repeated clicks to get different behaviors. Repeatedly using slow-on, for example, will advance the Hue themes, or fast-on (double-click) the mudroom will _also_ illuminate most of the first floor in addition to the normal mud room load.\n\nMaybe I'm too modest when I say I keep things simple, but to me, it's simple when the alarm panel is an alarm panel, light switches are light switches (with extra features), and you don't _have_ to use a phone or tablet to do simple things.\n\nThe one concession to the cloud I make is voice, but I do is all via HA instead of vendor-specific solutions.
