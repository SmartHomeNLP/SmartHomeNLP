e33i2xz <NEW TIER> t3_926ggu,"Definitely Amtech. Hopefully they don't have a data cap but it doesn't sound like you'd hit one unless it was unreasonably low. Those being your choices, you'd do fine with the $40 plan. I'd personally go with the $60 plan since you're doubling your speeds for an additional $20. That solely depends on your priority though. <NEW TIER> I did ask and he said there was no data cap. I forgot to mention that in the post. But thanks!",e33i2xz,t3_926ggu,New Apartment,"Hello,

I am moving into a new apartment and I’m currently looking at different WiFi packages. I wanted to try to get some recommendations on speed. I would ultimately like to save money but need a reliable connection.

A little bit about my usage:

I am a smart home geek and run things such as Philip’s hue bulbs, nest thermostat, 2 Apple TVs, multiple smart plugs, 3 computers, and a smart tv. That being said other than the hue lights and some occasional Netflix, I don’t rely on my WiFi all that much.

Right now the prices I have been quoted are:

Xfinity: 150 mbps. ↓ 5 mbps.↑ - $55/month

Amtech: 50 mbps. ⇅ - $40/month

Amtech: 100 mbps. ⇅ - $60/month

My apartment provides complimentary 5 mbps. but I know that won’t be sufficient for what I need. What would you guys recommend?
