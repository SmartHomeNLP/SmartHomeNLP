koenvervloesem,"Yes, you can create a 100% offline smart home. For instance, install a home automation system that puts local control first, such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), and don't use any of its integrations with online services. Another interesting system, focusing on privacy, is [Candle](https://www.candlesmarthome.com/). For an even more DIY approach, I have written a book about creating a fully offline home automation system based on MQTT: [Control Your Home with Raspberry Pi](https://koen.vervloesem.eu/books/control-your-home-with-raspberry-pi/).

For an offline voice assistant, I recommend [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (disclaimer: I'm a contributor). Note that this is more a voice assistant *toolkit* than a ready-to-use voice assistant. However, it has a very welcoming [community](https://community.rhasspy.org/).

sickofdefaultsubs,"Budget considerations aside a FLIR based system with a person detection algorithm could help make it super easy and reliable for the basic use cases without having to actually detect faces specifically. 
    
For basic stuff like room lighting it would be pretty accurate and reliable and you could probably have reasonably low resolution cameras which feed a processing unit live and without the ability to record to balance privacy concerns.
  
A person algorithm may be able to differentiate between adult and child for some personalisation then augment with your phone or tile based solution for ultra personalisation.
  
P.S. for the most part you could do something like this with regular cameras rather than FLIR (i.e. person detection rather than facial rec) the benefit with FLIR though will be that it works in all light conditions and will probably be easier for the cameras to reliably detect people regardless of movement levels.",1603110307,g9bfbcp,t3_jdyilm,t3_jdyilm,/r/homeautomation/comments/jdyilm/idea_for_fully_automatic_lights/g9bfbcp/,1,homeautomation
Nixellion,"Well, there are similar systems.

If you're talking about carrying a 'tag' with you, like a phone, then you're basically describing bluethooth beacons. Each room would have a bluethooth 'host' device, there's even a project for raspberry pi for this. Room Assistant it's called I think. With Bluethooth, as any other radio device, you can see what devices are in range of the beacon and have signal strength (RSSI) value. From signal strength you can estimate the distance to the beacon. The bonus point is that walls drop the signal by a lot, so it's not hard to use it to detect when bluethooth device is in the room and how many of them are.

I did play with similar approach using just 1 bluethooth 'host' and RSSI signal was reliable enough to detect whether I was in my room or not. The only problem I had was that at least with my particular usb bluethooth adapter when I tried to poll devices around like every 5-10 seconds I think it spammed too much, and bluetooth headphones started to disconnect frequently.

But the point is, it works.

Another option is using a camera with person detection. That's by far the best and most reliable way, and it's often used in cafes and other public places wherever you can see counters saying how many people are there, for example. The obvous downside is privacy concerns. Even if you can make sure that these cameras are secure someone could still hack them. And even if not - you will still need to convince other people you live (if any) about their security.

If you're talking about a directional motion sensor, that's something I was thinking about myself. Should not be that hard to achieve in a DIY way at least. You could use dual distance sensors, for example, lidars or something.  The only problem is that there's no way to acquire initial state of room prescience on restart. So it will easily get out of sync, because youre not detecting people in the room, you're just detecting objects passing by the sensor. 

And the most common approach is also quite effective - motion sensors. Cover each room with motion sensors, PIR, and logic is quite simple and old - if motion detected - instantly switch room to ""people in"". If no motion within 10-30 minutes - room is empty. It can only fail if you're sitting really still or sleeping. So those cases can be addressed individually. For my PC a made a script that each few seconds takes a picture from my web camera and runs face detection. If my face is there - i'm in the room and working on pc. 

For beds you could use pressure sensors.",1603100402,g9b4md6,t3_jdyilm,t3_jdyilm,/r/homeautomation/comments/jdyilm/idea_for_fully_automatic_lights/g9b4md6/,1,homeautomation

I would be going online and doing some intense and in depth research to find out how to either access it or disable it until the other roommate can come to an agreed upon resolution.

kigmatzomat,"You can do that with homeseer for sure. I am not sure about hubitat's camera support. In each case you would only use the homeseer or hubitat app. 

Before you buy things, here is a primer on home automation (HA) tech:

Zwave, zigbee and insteon are ""full stack"" automation solutions. What that means is that communication layer, enrollment, encryption, API and device attributes are baked in. Every smart switch uses the ""switch"" profile and the command for ""light on"" is always the same. Zwave and zigbee allow for new, novel commands when new device types hit the market. They are not IP/wifi-based (they have their own network technology) .

Zwave, zigbee, and insteon use mesh radio networks. Low power, so battery friendly, and the mesh let's them have decent range. However only mains-powered devices can act as relays. Zwave is 900Mhz (good signal penetration for power but frequency varies by country), zigbee is 2.4Ghz (which can conflict with bluetooth and wifi b). Insteon is 900Mhz and also has powerline signaling as well in a dual-path configuration that is great in concrete block/steel housing that eats RF.

Compare them to wifi devices, which are wifi+tcp+ip+custom encryption+custom API+custom attributes. ""Wifi"" is just networking, there are several more components you need for device controls and they are very disparate. Even a ""standards"" based solution using MQTT as the API layer can have devices of the same type with radically different commands and attributes (lights on/off, power true/false, etc) or implement different encryption schemes. In zwave, zigbee, insteon the command for ""power on/off"" is clearly defined. Wifi also has security concerns as IoT devices have become prime targets for botnets and could come with malware or viruses.

Yes, ZWave, Zigbee, Insteon require hubs/controllers. Guess what? So do the wifi devices! They have a doodad (wifi access point) that connects to a phone/tablet/cloud. Surprise! Those are computers running a program to be the brain! Want a less pleasant surprise? A lot of the times (like &gt;80% of the time) that computer requires some cloud computer to be online. If there's any internet problems or the people running that cloud computer shut it down, your stuff stops working. Even less pleasant, you may need multiple clouds, meaning there are 2 or 3 different ways your gear can turn into doorstops. E.g. Using Alexa to control a Tuya bulb. Amazon has to be reachable for the echo to work and then they have to have the connector to the Tuya/SmartLife cloud AND your bulb has to be logged into the Tuya cloud. If Amazon decides to stop supporting Tuya, it breaks. If Tuya decides to shut down their system, it breaks. If your internet is down, it breaks. If Amazon's internet is down, it breaks. If Tuya's internet is down, it breaks.

I prefer zwave for a couple reasons. First, Zwave mandates compliance and security testing. A handful of devices with implementation flaws have slipped through over the last 15 years and then the compliance test is updated to prevent that from happening again. With Zigbee that's optional. I also hearken from the bad old days where companies abused zigbee' custom configuration option and made ALL commands custom (I believe Xiaomi is still bad about this as they don't follow the officials zigbee spec). Zwave allows manufacturer specific commands but only when an existing command isn't appropriate, and it is enforced. Lastly, zwave has more 110v devices (switches, plugs, power strips), locks, thermostats and smoke/co detectors. There are various reasons but short answer is most retailers require110v devices/smoke detectors/locks/thermostats to have UL/ETL certification which is expensive and most zigbee device manufacturers are going for low cost/low overhead.

Zigbee is great if you want a lot of battery powered sensors on the cheap. The other thing it has a lot of is bulbs, due to Hue using the LightLink flavor of zigbee. It has been chosen by IKEA as their tech standard, which may be a plus. The last thing to remember for zigbee is that you need a Zigbee3 controller. Prior to Zigbee3 you either had a ZigbeeLL (lighting products) or a ZigbeeHA (locks, sensors, etc plus lights, but not the same commands as LL) and the two didn't talk. They still won't talk to each other, but Zigbee3 controllers will talk to both. Eventually all the old zigbee LL/HA devices will fade from the market but it will be a while.

Insteon is sole source. Pretty gear, well made, all works together, but one supplier. I like options. But its like more Apple than Apple.

Controllers come in cloud-based and local processing flavors. What this means is a local processing controller will work without an internet-hosted service. SmartThings, for instance, loses most automations when their service is unavailable and you can't control the devices at all when that happens as the phone app connects to the ST cloud. (They are changing some of that but also abandoning their old software APIs so lots of ST functions are going to break) a controller where all the logic runs in your house will keep doing its thing even if the internet goes down, let alone a specific web service.

In the ""open box, start using it"" category, Homeseer, Hubitat and Apple Homekit are local systems. In the build-it-yourself category, HomeAssistant has the most vocal fan base followed by OpenHab. The other controllers I know of require some cloud services or they become either mindless zombies or doorstops. (Or are end-of-life and not worth buying right now, like Vera or alpha status like EzLo)

Unless you are a tinkerer, I recommend using pre-built controllers. Home automation is complicated enough to get the automation logic working the way you want to also have to exert effort on getting the controller running.

Controller wise, I use HomeSeer. They have been around for 20 years and make devices as well as controllers so they have a solid engineering core. It's a bit more expensive in some cases (like if you have 2 of each technology and don't standardize) but all HA is expensive so cheaping out on the brains seems stupid. Like ""hiring a teenager to drive your limo because you can pay them minimum wage"" stupid.

I like HS because it is rock solid, worked out of the box, I have root access to the hardware so I can add other software if I want, and it meets my ""able to make backups and shift to other hardware"" requirement. They also have a deep product range, with cheap but powerful intro model based on a Pi3b and go up to x86 win10 appliances and can run on my hardware.

Homeseer was my 3rd controller and I wanted something I could get up and running fast as I already had 3 dozen devices and a host of automations to recreate. Homeseer let me set up and migrate all the devices on a saturday and I got the automations figured out on sunday. Very high spousal approval factor (SAF). It plays nice with Alexa and Google.

If you really have your eye on Zigbee, Hubitat is a good choice. The system has zigbee and zwave radios built in and it supports a large number of zigbee devices. Iirc, xioami devices are supported by 3rd party drivers. But the hardware has less cpu power so it can get overwhelmed by large installs or complex automations. It too works with Google and Alexa.

Apple people will gravitate to homekit. Its not a bad choice but product selection is limited. Homekit is a special thing. Its a mix of wifi with custom APIs and bluetooth with custom APIs. Apple validates all of it so its solid and it is a local system, using an ipad or appletv as the hub. (I recommend the appletv just because you don't want to accidentally take your home controller on vacation or let its battery die.) But...its got apple fingerprints all over it but its dependent on 3rd party suppliers. Apple isn't great at having business partners so it is a little worrisome. Plus, you know, Apple walled garden.

But it works with Siri. And it's about the only thing that does work with Siri officially. There is a kind of backdoor using an app called HomeBridge, which uses Homekit developer APIs to let you connect some other controller (pretty much anything I have mentioned above) to Homekit. It works, it seems reliable but....any iOS update can close that backdoor.",1603551244,g9wztkh,t3_jh595g,t3_jh595g,/r/homeautomation/comments/jh595g/new_home_setup/g9wztkh/,1,homeautomation

babecafe,"Useful, but the reality is wiring to breakers is done long before the switch/outlet covers are put on. Switches and outlets could be installed before or after drywall - mine were done after drywall. Covers are put on after painting the wall, and is otherwise a fairly mindless task: just match the number of gangs and screw them in place all around the house.

So, is the worker installing the covers going to consult someone's circuit map and put on labels that no one else can see without undoing the work? A homeowner or subsequent worker shouldn't trust such labels.

I had my electrician label breaker panels as they pulled the rough wiring. Even then, it wasn't perfect, but it's more accurate than when the electrician gets reminded the local inspector will check for breaker panel labels just before final inspection.

If I had reason to remove a cover once, I might label it in case I had to do it again. But I'd still check the correct breaker has been turned off.",1603070751,g9a4zp6,t3_jds2gg,t3_jds2gg,/r/smarthome/comments/jds2gg/life_hacks_label_backs_of_switchoutlet_covers/g9a4zp6/,4,smarthome
