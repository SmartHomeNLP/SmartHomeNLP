koenvervloesem,"Yes, you can create a 100% offline smart home. For instance, install a home automation system that puts local control first, such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), and don't use any of its integrations with online services. Another interesting system, focusing on privacy, is [Candle](https://www.candlesmarthome.com/). For an even more DIY approach, I have written a book about creating a fully offline home automation system based on MQTT: [Control Your Home with Raspberry Pi](https://koen.vervloesem.eu/books/control-your-home-with-raspberry-pi/).

For an offline voice assistant, I recommend [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (disclaimer: I'm a contributor). Note that this is more a voice assistant *toolkit* than a ready-to-use voice assistant. However, it has a very welcoming [community](https://community.rhasspy.org/).

sickofdefaultsubs,"Budget considerations aside a FLIR based system with a person detection algorithm could help make it super easy and reliable for the basic use cases without having to actually detect faces specifically. 
    
For basic stuff like room lighting it would be pretty accurate and reliable and you could probably have reasonably low resolution cameras which feed a processing unit live and without the ability to record to balance privacy concerns.
  
A person algorithm may be able to differentiate between adult and child for some personalisation then augment with your phone or tile based solution for ultra personalisation.
  
P.S. for the most part you could do something like this with regular cameras rather than FLIR (i.e. person detection rather than facial rec) the benefit with FLIR though will be that it works in all light conditions and will probably be easier for the cameras to reliably detect people regardless of movement levels.",1603110307,g9bfbcp,t3_jdyilm,t3_jdyilm,/r/homeautomation/comments/jdyilm/idea_for_fully_automatic_lights/g9bfbcp/,1,homeautomation
Nixellion,"Well, there are similar systems.

If you're talking about carrying a 'tag' with you, like a phone, then you're basically describing bluethooth beacons. Each room would have a bluethooth 'host' device, there's even a project for raspberry pi for this. Room Assistant it's called I think. With Bluethooth, as any other radio device, you can see what devices are in range of the beacon and have signal strength (RSSI) value. From signal strength you can estimate the distance to the beacon. The bonus point is that walls drop the signal by a lot, so it's not hard to use it to detect when bluethooth device is in the room and how many of them are.

I did play with similar approach using just 1 bluethooth 'host' and RSSI signal was reliable enough to detect whether I was in my room or not. The only problem I had was that at least with my particular usb bluethooth adapter when I tried to poll devices around like every 5-10 seconds I think it spammed too much, and bluetooth headphones started to disconnect frequently.

But the point is, it works.

Another option is using a camera with person detection. That's by far the best and most reliable way, and it's often used in cafes and other public places wherever you can see counters saying how many people are there, for example. The obvous downside is privacy concerns. Even if you can make sure that these cameras are secure someone could still hack them. And even if not - you will still need to convince other people you live (if any) about their security.

If you're talking about a directional motion sensor, that's something I was thinking about myself. Should not be that hard to achieve in a DIY way at least. You could use dual distance sensors, for example, lidars or something.  The only problem is that there's no way to acquire initial state of room prescience on restart. So it will easily get out of sync, because youre not detecting people in the room, you're just detecting objects passing by the sensor. 

And the most common approach is also quite effective - motion sensors. Cover each room with motion sensors, PIR, and logic is quite simple and old - if motion detected - instantly switch room to ""people in"". If no motion within 10-30 minutes - room is empty. It can only fail if you're sitting really still or sleeping. So those cases can be addressed individually. For my PC a made a script that each few seconds takes a picture from my web camera and runs face detection. If my face is there - i'm in the room and working on pc. 

For beds you could use pressure sensors.",1603100402,g9b4md6,t3_jdyilm,t3_jdyilm,/r/homeautomation/comments/jdyilm/idea_for_fully_automatic_lights/g9b4md6/,1,homeautomation

MikeP001,"This is the right answer (assuming by ""wired"" he means ""powered"").  Zigbee/zwave is too expensive and too opaque.  When something isn't working it's very hard to figure out what's wrong.  Hue was a real PITA for a long time (they've been better recently).  Wifi devices are much cheaper and problems are easier to sort.  And you can trace/log everything that happens.

I don't know why some have had so much trouble with wifi, I've used it and zigbee with many, many IoT devices for many years and prefer wifi.  The warning of performance problems is silly, there just isn't enough data being moved to be an issue.   Only very old wifi routers have trouble with &lt; 50 clients, and most can handle many more.

MikeP001,"Usage data is collected and logged for any IoT device that's registered to a cloud service.  At best it's used for problem determination, load and capacity planning, and perhaps analysed for marketing purposes.  For example, how you use your lights, when you arrive home, etc, might give personal information for targeted advertising (watch the ads you're shown after doing a google search for a product) or group based advertising.  Remember it costs money to run a service, so if the manufacturer is offering it for free they're making money from you some other way (purchase of an IoT device is not an ongoing revenue stream).

Some countries don't have strong or respected privacy laws to ensure your data is not used in a way you would dislike.

One bad case is if the manufacturer's data is hacked/stolen.  Three's a lot of juicy information - your GPS location, your SSIDs &amp; passwords, often your address and email, maybe security PINs, and a lot of data about your habits - like when you're usually home or out at work.  Your account password (don't reuse ids &amp; PWs!!!).  Seems like something that would have value if sold to the wrong people, e.g. burglars.

Another would be if the service was owned by a hostile party - maybe they would shut down all of their enemies IoT devices - mostly an inconvenience, but not good.  A scarier example is if they updated the firmware on them to act as bridges into your network, perhaps stealing or corrupting local data, or installing bots, or spyware, etc.

Maybe all they can see of you is your garage door, but other folks use them to watch pets, children etc.  so it's not a good idea to expose camera feeds (and passwords aren't enough).

A good way to keep safe is to setup a separate, protected network for your IoT devices and block them from the internet - then there's much less risk.  That means you need IoT devices with local APIs / no cloud dependence and an automation system that can control them.

kigmatzomat,"You can do that with homeseer for sure. I am not sure about hubitat's camera support. In each case you would only use the homeseer or hubitat app. 

Before you buy things, here is a primer on home automation (HA) tech:

Zwave, zigbee and insteon are ""full stack"" automation solutions. What that means is that communication layer, enrollment, encryption, API and device attributes are baked in. Every smart switch uses the ""switch"" profile and the command for ""light on"" is always the same. Zwave and zigbee allow for new, novel commands when new device types hit the market. They are not IP/wifi-based (they have their own network technology) .

Zwave, zigbee, and insteon use mesh radio networks. Low power, so battery friendly, and the mesh let's them have decent range. However only mains-powered devices can act as relays. Zwave is 900Mhz (good signal penetration for power but frequency varies by country), zigbee is 2.4Ghz (which can conflict with bluetooth and wifi b). Insteon is 900Mhz and also has powerline signaling as well in a dual-path configuration that is great in concrete block/steel housing that eats RF.

Compare them to wifi devices, which are wifi+tcp+ip+custom encryption+custom API+custom attributes. ""Wifi"" is just networking, there are several more components you need for device controls and they are very disparate. Even a ""standards"" based solution using MQTT as the API layer can have devices of the same type with radically different commands and attributes (lights on/off, power true/false, etc) or implement different encryption schemes. In zwave, zigbee, insteon the command for ""power on/off"" is clearly defined. Wifi also has security concerns as IoT devices have become prime targets for botnets and could come with malware or viruses.

Yes, ZWave, Zigbee, Insteon require hubs/controllers. Guess what? So do the wifi devices! They have a doodad (wifi access point) that connects to a phone/tablet/cloud. Surprise! Those are computers running a program to be the brain! Want a less pleasant surprise? A lot of the times (like &gt;80% of the time) that computer requires some cloud computer to be online. If there's any internet problems or the people running that cloud computer shut it down, your stuff stops working. Even less pleasant, you may need multiple clouds, meaning there are 2 or 3 different ways your gear can turn into doorstops. E.g. Using Alexa to control a Tuya bulb. Amazon has to be reachable for the echo to work and then they have to have the connector to the Tuya/SmartLife cloud AND your bulb has to be logged into the Tuya cloud. If Amazon decides to stop supporting Tuya, it breaks. If Tuya decides to shut down their system, it breaks. If your internet is down, it breaks. If Amazon's internet is down, it breaks. If Tuya's internet is down, it breaks.

I prefer zwave for a couple reasons. First, Zwave mandates compliance and security testing. A handful of devices with implementation flaws have slipped through over the last 15 years and then the compliance test is updated to prevent that from happening again. With Zigbee that's optional. I also hearken from the bad old days where companies abused zigbee' custom configuration option and made ALL commands custom (I believe Xiaomi is still bad about this as they don't follow the officials zigbee spec). Zwave allows manufacturer specific commands but only when an existing command isn't appropriate, and it is enforced. Lastly, zwave has more 110v devices (switches, plugs, power strips), locks, thermostats and smoke/co detectors. There are various reasons but short answer is most retailers require110v devices/smoke detectors/locks/thermostats to have UL/ETL certification which is expensive and most zigbee device manufacturers are going for low cost/low overhead.

Zigbee is great if you want a lot of battery powered sensors on the cheap. The other thing it has a lot of is bulbs, due to Hue using the LightLink flavor of zigbee. It has been chosen by IKEA as their tech standard, which may be a plus. The last thing to remember for zigbee is that you need a Zigbee3 controller. Prior to Zigbee3 you either had a ZigbeeLL (lighting products) or a ZigbeeHA (locks, sensors, etc plus lights, but not the same commands as LL) and the two didn't talk. They still won't talk to each other, but Zigbee3 controllers will talk to both. Eventually all the old zigbee LL/HA devices will fade from the market but it will be a while.

Insteon is sole source. Pretty gear, well made, all works together, but one supplier. I like options. But its like more Apple than Apple.

Controllers come in cloud-based and local processing flavors. What this means is a local processing controller will work without an internet-hosted service. SmartThings, for instance, loses most automations when their service is unavailable and you can't control the devices at all when that happens as the phone app connects to the ST cloud. (They are changing some of that but also abandoning their old software APIs so lots of ST functions are going to break) a controller where all the logic runs in your house will keep doing its thing even if the internet goes down, let alone a specific web service.

In the ""open box, start using it"" category, Homeseer, Hubitat and Apple Homekit are local systems. In the build-it-yourself category, HomeAssistant has the most vocal fan base followed by OpenHab. The other controllers I know of require some cloud services or they become either mindless zombies or doorstops. (Or are end-of-life and not worth buying right now, like Vera or alpha status like EzLo)

Unless you are a tinkerer, I recommend using pre-built controllers. Home automation is complicated enough to get the automation logic working the way you want to also have to exert effort on getting the controller running.

Controller wise, I use HomeSeer. They have been around for 20 years and make devices as well as controllers so they have a solid engineering core. It's a bit more expensive in some cases (like if you have 2 of each technology and don't standardize) but all HA is expensive so cheaping out on the brains seems stupid. Like ""hiring a teenager to drive your limo because you can pay them minimum wage"" stupid.

I like HS because it is rock solid, worked out of the box, I have root access to the hardware so I can add other software if I want, and it meets my ""able to make backups and shift to other hardware"" requirement. They also have a deep product range, with cheap but powerful intro model based on a Pi3b and go up to x86 win10 appliances and can run on my hardware.

Homeseer was my 3rd controller and I wanted something I could get up and running fast as I already had 3 dozen devices and a host of automations to recreate. Homeseer let me set up and migrate all the devices on a saturday and I got the automations figured out on sunday. Very high spousal approval factor (SAF). It plays nice with Alexa and Google.

If you really have your eye on Zigbee, Hubitat is a good choice. The system has zigbee and zwave radios built in and it supports a large number of zigbee devices. Iirc, xioami devices are supported by 3rd party drivers. But the hardware has less cpu power so it can get overwhelmed by large installs or complex automations. It too works with Google and Alexa.

Apple people will gravitate to homekit. Its not a bad choice but product selection is limited. Homekit is a special thing. Its a mix of wifi with custom APIs and bluetooth with custom APIs. Apple validates all of it so its solid and it is a local system, using an ipad or appletv as the hub. (I recommend the appletv just because you don't want to accidentally take your home controller on vacation or let its battery die.) But...its got apple fingerprints all over it but its dependent on 3rd party suppliers. Apple isn't great at having business partners so it is a little worrisome. Plus, you know, Apple walled garden.

But it works with Siri. And it's about the only thing that does work with Siri officially. There is a kind of backdoor using an app called HomeBridge, which uses Homekit developer APIs to let you connect some other controller (pretty much anything I have mentioned above) to Homekit.

kigmatzomat,"Here is my primer on HA tech

Technologies: Zwave, zigbee and insteon are ""full stack"" automation solutions. What that means is that communication layer, enrollment, encryption, API and device attributes are baked in. Every smart switch uses the ""switch"" profile and the command for ""light on"" is always the same. Zwave and zigbee allow for new, novel commands when new device types hit the market. They are not IP/wifi-based (they have their own network technology) .

Zwave, zigbee, and insteon use mesh radio networks. Low power, so battery friendly, and the mesh let's them have decent range. However only mains-powered devices can act as relays. Zwave is 900Mhz (good signal penetration for power but frequency varies by country), zigbee is 2.4Ghz (which can conflict with bluetooth and wifi b). Insteon is 900Mhz and also has powerline signaling as well in a dual-path configuration that is great in concrete block/steel housing that eats RF.

Compare to wifi devices, which are wifi+tcp+ip+custom encryption+custom API+custom attributes. ""Wifi"" is just networking, there are several more components you need for device controls and they are very disparate. Even a ""standards"" based solution using MQTT as the API layer can have devices of the same type with radically different commands and attributes (lights on/off, power true/false, etc) or implement different encryption schemes. In zwave, zigbee, insteon the command for ""power on/off"" is clearly defined. Wifi also has security concerns as IoT devices have become prime targets for botnets.

Yes, ZWave, Zigbee, Insteon require hubs/controllers. Guess what? So do the wifi devices! They have a doodad (wifi access point) that connects to a phone/tablet/cloud. Surprise! Those are computers running a program to be the brain! Want a less pleasant surprise? A lot of the times (like &gt;80% of the time) that computer requires some cloud computer to be online. If there's any internet problems or the people running that cloud computer shut it down, your stuff stops working. Even less pleasant, you may need multiple clouds, meaning there are 2 or 3 different ways your gear can turn into doorstops. E.g. Using Alexa to control a Tuya bulb. Amazon has to be reachable for the echo to work and then they have to have the connector to the Tuya/SmartLife cloud AND your bulb has to be logged into the Tuya cloud. If Amazon decides to stop supporting Tuya, it breaks. If Tuya decides to shut down their system, it breaks. If your internet is down, it breaks. If Amazon's internet is down, it breaks. If Tuya's internet is down, it breaks.

I prefer zwave for a couple reasons. First, Zwave mandates compliance and security testing. A handful of devices with implementation flaws have slipped through over the last 15 years and then the compliance test is updated to prevent that from happening again. With Zigbee that's optional. I also hearken from the bad old days where companies abused zigbee' custom configuration option and made ALL commands custom (I believe Xiaomi is still bad about this as they don't follow the officials zigbee spec). Zwave allows manufacturer specific commands but only when an existing command isn't appropriate, and it is enforced. Lastly, zwave has more 110v devices (switches, plugs, power strips), locks, thermostats and smoke/co detectors. There are various reasons but short answer is most retailers require110v devices/smoke detectors/locks/thermostats to have UL/ETL certification which is expensive and most zigbee device manufacturers are going for low cost/low overhead.

Zigbee is great if you want a lot of battery powered sensors on the cheap. The other thing it has a lot of is bulbs, due to Hue using the LightLink flavor of zigbee. It has been chosen by IKEA as their tech standard, which may be a plus. The last thing to remember for zigbee is that you need a Zigbee3 controller. Prior to Zigbee3 you either had a ZigbeeLL (lighting products) or a ZigbeeHA (locks, sensors, etc plus lights, but not the same commands as LL) and the two didn't talk. They still won't talk to each other, but Zigbee3 controllers will talk to both. Eventually all the old zigbee LL/HA devices will fade from the market but it will be a while.

Insteon is sole source. Pretty gear, well made, all works together, but one supplier. I like options. But its like more Apple than Apple.

Controllers come in cloud-based and local processing flavors. What this means is a local processing controller will work without an internet-hosted service. SmartThings, for instance, loses most automations when their service is unavailable and you can't control the devices at all when that happens as the phone app connects to the ST cloud. (They are changing some of that but also abandoning their old software APIs so lots of ST functions are going to break) a controller where all the logic runs in your house will keep doing its thing even if the internet goes down, let alone a specific web service.

switched07,"&gt;WiFi is inherently less secure

Wifi is not inherently insecure.  It is absolutely 100% the opposite.  802.11 is designed with security in mind.  Yes WEP is easily crackable, but that is so far gone you can't even configure it as an option on  devices.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The issue is the security of personal data on the network. With lightbulbs, that's zero, so why connect low value targets on a network with high value targets especially when there's 11 other reasons not to do it? 

You continue to refuse to acknowledge any information I put forward on how to secure your network along with comments others have made.  Yes, a lightbulb doesn't have PII on it like maybe your laptop does.  But it certainly can be re-flashed and turned into a bot that carries out other malicious intent.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not only does it require *prior* penetration of the network, which in turn requires either physical access or near access while pairing a device, and takes up to an hour to do, but it still doesn't accomplish anything

I'll gladly spend a single hour cracking your zwave network.  It would take tens of thousands of hours to brute force a WPA2 PSK.  And that assumes you don't have measures in place that alerts your or auto blacklists devices that you notice doing that well before hand.  Good luck brute forcing a WPA2/WPA3 network with Dot1x authentication.

1) Z-Wave requires near access - not true for internet-connected WiFi.

2) It requires prior penetration of the network to flash a device to penetrate the Z-Wave network. Although technically true for WiFi, prior penetration can be accomplished any number of ways, like an email attachment.

3) Who gives a shit? Take over my thermostat, and I only care if/when that gives access to my phone or computer, or anyone else's.

There is little need for encryption with them, except with specific security-related devices (such as a door lock). For that... use Z-Wave encryption. The need for WiFi encryption proves it's not a good choice.

I said in the other comment thread, but I'll reiterate here.  Just because my laptop doesnt have a zwave wireless adaptor in it that allows me to fire up a laptop and attempt to connect to your zwave network , DOES NOT make that  secure. 

What's to stop some one from taking a USB that you'd use for say your home assistant Pi box and writing a drive for some other linux distro and attempting to brute force your zwave encryption or whatever mechanism it uses to build a network? ( I believe these products exist based on my initial research into Home Assistant) Is it even secure? Does it use generally accepted security mechanisms like AES or SHA or something else?  I ask because I don't know these answers, but would love to know.  Otherwise this just seems like a security by obscurity argument to me.

WPA2/WPA3 are secure and have no known vulnerabilities last I checked.  I know how to secure my wireless network and I'd feel comfortable advocating that is is more secure than zigbee/bt/zwave.",1603253848,g9idw8z,t3_jb393t,t1_g8tgfy5,/r/homeautomation/comments/jb393t/mega_reasons_to_avoid_wifi_products_thread/g9idw8z/,1,homeautomation
switched07,"I'm still working my way thru this thread, so excuse me if this has been said later on... But as others have pointed out...I'm not entirely convinced you understand network fundamentals.  You talk control protocols and command structures for your zwave/zigbee devices but then try make a direct comparison to  TCP/IP and/or 802.11.  Your control protocol you seem to be referring to is a set of commands to control the devices, likely not the actual L2 mechanism used for zigbee/zwave to put the data over the air to make the device to do something.  In the case of  802.11, frames are merely an encapsulation mechanism for your ""control protocol"" (the payload) to make said IoT device do something.  Same would be true for TCP/IP, there is a data payload that is in that packet.  Packet/Frame are technically two different things, but are generally used interchangeably for simplification, so excuse me if I do that in the thread. 802.11 uses frames because its Layer 2.  In that 802.11 frame there is a data payload that contains the actual data that the IoT device is going to execute. 

I dont know anything about how zwave/zigbee actually puts data out over the air, but I'd be willing to guess it has to be encoded and modulated very very similar to 802.11.  Again your control protocol is merely the data used to tell the device what to do.  NOT how the zwave/zigbee devices talk to each other wirelessly.

I've seen a lot of debate about the lack of security on 802.11 wireless, and let me be clear,  802.11 is EXTREMELY secure.  802.11 wireless networks are more secure than a wired network by default. There are certainly ways you can fuck that up and make them less secure, but 802.11 has a lot of  robust security mechanisms built directly into the protocol stack.   WPA2 has NOT been cracked by anyone and we already have lots of WPA3 support out there.  So even using a PSK ensures your network is secure from outside bad actors trying to crack your key and gain access.  WEP has been depreciated for Yeats and WPA is well on its way out.  Now once someone is on your network using a shared PSK its a different story, but thats were a TON of other security mechanisms come into play.  For starters we can use 802.1x authentication.  I understand this is outside the capabilities of many home routers, but anyone building something to this level of complexity, could easily put something together to use this.  However, the rub is that most IoT devices(that I have seen) dont generally support this in their supplicant.  So now we start talking about separate SSIDs with a IoT only VLAN for segmentation and using Firewalls and Network Access Control Lists and peer2peer blocking, just for starters.  There are lot of other mechanisms but that really puts us into the enterprise grade level and vary from vendor to vendor.  I believe most  consumer grade wireless solutions offer some level the features I call out.  Eero has some of this built in, and I bet a lot of folks go down the UnFi path when building this out, and I'm certain that has a lot of these capabilities.  Of course all this means using something more advanced(expensive) then the combo modem/router/wifi device  the comcasts of the world are going to install when you get internet service.

So I feel like your negatives against the lack of security of 802.11 is simply because you don't understand it.  Also I'm guessing the same is true when you say zwave and zigbee are secure.  Its pretty easy to claim your wireless protocol is secure when there aren't any zigbee/zwave cards I can plug into my laptop and start trying to break the encryption protocol being used between devices.  Security by obscurity is not really security at all. And further more how do I troubleshoot zigbee?  I can't do a packet capture on it, like I can easily do on my wifi network. I can't do a wireless site survey with it, like I can 802.11 to easily see where my signal is weak.   Can I run debugs on the Zigbee controller and see packet level info? can I see the mesh tree it builds?  Can I run a debug on the controller to see where the break is in my mesh link?  Can I see RSSI of the zigbee devices?   I honestly don't know the answer to this, but I'd venture to guess, no I can't.  

For reference, I am a CCIE-Wireless and have a CWNE, I'd consider myself pretty well educated on networking and especially proficient in wireless technologies.",1603251716,g9iavyu,t3_jb393t,t1_g8w8ch6,/r/homeautomation/comments/jb393t/mega_reasons_to_avoid_wifi_products_thread/g9iavyu/,1,homeautomation

I had my electrician label breaker panels as they pulled the rough wiring. Even then, it wasn't perfect, but it's more accurate than when the electrician gets reminded the local inspector will check for breaker panel labels just before final inspection.

boxsterguy,"&gt; using both 2.4 and 5 ghz networks means less power is available compared to lone/dedicated 5 ghz. 

Outside of the absolute worst possible wifi AP, that's not a thing.  If a wifi AP is going to support two bands, it will budget the right amount of power for each band.  Let's call that X.  That means at the very least it can provide 2X power, because that's what its components need.  If you turn off one of the networks, the other isn't going to draw 2X power.  It's going to continue to draw X power, because that's what it's designed to use.  If you turn both on, you're not going to get Y where Y &lt; X power.  You're going to get X, because that's how it was designed.

Doing otherwise would be silly.

&gt; Second, the 2.4 network is noisy and using it for iot devices means interference for other things like wireless phones and gaming controllers., non wifi devices that use this shared spectrum.

Yes, 2.4GHz is widely shared.  But 2.4GHz is pretty wide, and most devices don't actually overlap.  Even when they do, because 2.4GHz is a mostly unregulated shared space device manufacturers will generally employ various frequency agility techniques, shielding, and other mechanisms to avoid interference where possible (see microwaves as a prime example -- I haven't noticed any microwave-related interference in my 2.4GHz networks in probably 20 years, because Microwaves have implemented significantly better shielding).

Also, if you're going to worry about 2.4GHz, don't forget that Zigbee sits there, too.  If anything, I'd trust wifi routers to better be able to deal with interference because they're used by an order of magnitude more people (if not several orders of magnitude).

&gt; Third, I just personally hate having to keep my 2.4 active just for my smart thermostat, smart plugs and a wifi camera.

What harm does it do you, though?

&gt; Also see this guy's response:

People are making statements of authority without any actual explanation or any backing source.  Take this guy, for instance.  His claim is that devices with weak signal will slow down the entire rest of the network.  At first glance, that makes absolutely no sense.  You could dig into it, and I suspect the justification here goes something like, ""A device with a weak signal has to negotiate its connection more frequently.  If the router is wasting time negotiating reconnections for these weak devices, it's not spending time on actually sending and receiving data, therefore slowing down everybody.""  But that's pure speculation without some backing source saying that's how wifi routers work.  And even if it is, there are tunables that you can adjust to reduce the time spent on that.  And ""unless you have MIMO"" is an ambiguous statement, because MIMO has been built into the standard since 802.11n.  What he likely meant was [MU-MIMO](https://www.howtogeek.com/242793/what-is-mu-mimo-and-do-i-need-it-on-my-router/), and that requires both client and router support and requires 802.11ac as a minimum.  Since most IoT devices are cheap 802.11n, they're definitely not going to use MU-MIMO.  And even if they did, the benefit is overstated (did you know right now that processes on your PC are ""taking turns""?  It just happens so fast that you can't possible notice.  And wifi is exactly the same way).

tl;dr: lots of claims being made without any sort of backing data.  If you want to claim something, back it up.",1602704011,g8trmk4,t3_jb393t,t1_g8tofpy,/r/homeautomation/comments/jb393t/mega_reasons_to_avoid_wifi_products_thread/g8trmk4/,1,homeautomation
wickedsun,"DHCP is irrelevant. In most consumer grade DHCP servers (which is usually hosted by the consumer grade router), the DHCP pool matches the subnet of the interface, and in most cases you can't change the subnet mask, and that mask is 255.255.255.0 (or /24). This is why there's a ""limit"", but I'd like to add that this limit is for *anything* that connects to the router on any given interface so.. definitely not a WiFi limitation. Also, please find me one of those IoT device that doesn't support DHCP. I'll wait.

No device can ""walk across subnet"", that's not how networking works. Any device that ""walks across subnets"" does so via the gateway. A router does that for you. This is the fundamental difference between a router and a switch. A switch is layer 2, it deals with MAC addresses and has ports. A router deals with IP addresses and has interfaces. Each interface is configured with a different IP (subnets even), and the router acts as a gateway between those different subnets, with a gateway of last resort (commonly known as a default gateway) for all traffic who's destination is not in the routing table.

Your computer has, for all intents and purposes, only a default gateway configured and so do most of your devices on your network.

Your fundamentals of networking are way off.

I have all 3 technologies in my house. The only one not giving me issues is WiFi. My zwave switch doesn't update its status so sometimes in HA it looks like it's off, but it's on, for example.

ZigBee some devices just won't reset and rejoin the network or will do so after a million tries.

WiFi? Not a single problem. Everything flashed with tasmota has been a bliss. My main subnet is a /23 and I have multiple SSIDs connecting to different subnets.

As far as ""GINER HAS MY IP"", just block traffic from your IoT network going to the outside world, and let through traffic you know is legit, or make sure everything is flashed with a firmware you trust.

time_to_reset,"TL;DR: Think about what you would want in an ideal world. Think of the problem you want to fix, don't think about solutions just yet. Think about what things in your day to day make your life better. Once you have a clear idea what those things are, look at solutions. 

I'll copy this from a reply I posted elsewhere:

&gt;I've found it's usually a combination of products. It's not a single light bulb, doorbell, smart lock, thermostat, etc that makes a difference, it's combining them to solve a problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, being able to turn the lights on/off with my phone is more annoying than just flicking a light switch. It's technically smart, but I personally consider it a step back in terms of functionality. I would not want that in my house.  
&gt;  
&gt;Combine those lights with a motion sensor is an improvement. Now at least the lights come on when you walk in and go off when you leave.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, a hub that knows that you're in the room, around a time that you would normally be spending time in said room, that can tell it's too dark and adjusts the lights automatically. That's what you want from a smart home. At that point you forget there is such a thing as ""light switches"".  
&gt;  
&gt;So my recommendation would be to think of what annoys you in your day to day. Don't think in solutions yet, just think what you would want that would make your life better. Do you hate having to put the toilet seat down every time? Automate that (you can, there are automatic toilet seat closers). Hate that the fridge door stays open? Fix that. Does the sun coming through that one window make you squint when you're working, but only between 2pm and 3pm. Fix that.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'll give you a stupid example I have. I kept running into shit in my house when going to the bathroom at night. I like my room dark, but I'm also a messy person. So I put a tiny light under my bed and a sensor that can tell when I get out of bed. Now when I get up, a really faint underglow comes on. Like [this](https://removeandreplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Floating-Bed-With-LED-Lighting_13.jpg) but way dimmer. Just enough to see what's on the floor. After a minute it automatically goes off again.

&gt;Useful? To me it is. It fixed something that annoyed me at least once or twice a week, but I would completely understand it if you think it's useless.

Why do I recommend to do it like this is that this way you create a smart home that isn't a gimmick, but one that actually does what a smart home should do; make your life easier.

Doing it like this also prevents you from buying into an ecosystem that at the end turns out not to do everything you want/need. The solutions you're looking into, like Homekit and Google Home will quickly limit you for example. They're not designed for someone that really wants to create a proper smart home. They chose user-friendliness over functionality. Funnily enough, Alexa is the most versatile of the large 3, but still.

With that I don't mean they're bad, but you're buying into walled gardens that you'll quickly run into restrictions with. As u/doomboy1000 said, one is that if your internet is down, nothing works anymore for example. You can't turn on/off your lights, your alarms stop working, etc.

Another reason is that every device you buy, today and tomorrow, will have to be supported by the company you're going with. For reference my home has been running for almost a decade now. 

Do you trust Apple to not drop support for a device over that time? They kick services and apps from the App Store all the time. If you don't pay your Apple Developer Fee every year you're out, so if a company goes out of business for example, your device will stop working with Homekit even though the device itself might still work fine.

Google is no better.Do you trust Google not to start charging a subscription fee in the future for their services as they've started doing with Nest? Although realistically the bigger concern I would have is that they simply drop support, like they did when they bought Revolv. All of a sudden people were stuck with $300 paperweights.

So think about what you would really want out of a smart home, and then find the solution that will give you that. There's tons of solid solutions out there. I would recommend Samsung SmartThings over Homekit, Google Home and Alexa for example, but there are plenty of good alternatives.",1602136733,g832amo,t3_j72ub2,t3_j72ub2,/r/smarthome/comments/j72ub2/buying_a_house_at_the_end_of_the_month_looking_to/g832amo/,1,smarthome
